Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Web User Experience in 2021
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	The way people experience the web will see dramatic change in response to new tools, expectations and constraints in the coming years. This session will highlight some major forces shaping our medium and lead us in thinking about how we should expect to evolve what we deliver in light of changes in hardware, mobile, wearable, data, and software among others. We will look to parallels in architecture, aircraft and other technologies and suggest future trends that will evolve.   

Attendees will gain a better understanding of the changing nature of our environment and the impact of all of these forces and is appropriate for anyone working in this field who is interested in what the future may bring. Attendees will leave ready to make their own decisions about how best to embrace these forces in their own work.  

This session will extend and improve the Web User Experience in 2020 session given at DrupalCon New Orleans.

alright we're going to go ahead and get

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,220
started thanks everyone sorry for

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,870
starting a little bit late I'm actually

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,090
really impressed with the technical

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,990
staff here though I don't know if for

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,790
those of you been sitting in for a

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,580
little while they swapped out one TV

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,859
they like change the audio twice they're

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,010
like all over the plate like I've spoken

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,680
in many different situations where if

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,289
you were yeah in a bad situation you

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,260
were just in a bad situation so pretty

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:32,460
impressive so we're here today to talk

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:45,480
about web user experience in 2021 and if

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:48,149
this wakes up in time sorry this as you

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,070
see my name is gieux Gordon I've done a

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,170
bunch of things in the drupal space I

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,719
start off as a developer once a long

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,879
time ago and then eventually grew a team

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,800
of other people who were all really

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,149
talented which meant that I could do

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,590
something other than develop even though

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,140
I thought it was okay but I found better

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,700
people so then I became a CEO and then

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,710
somewhere along the way we invented a

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,590
product and that thing was called node

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,900
squirrel was bought by Pantheon and then

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,490
I went to Pantheon a new now do agency

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,680
and community outreach there so I've got

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,350
a bunch of different perspectives and

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,140
that's my contact info and frankly

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,450
that's enough about me I'm presenting a

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,759
bunch of stuff today very little of it

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,650
is originally mine and so I try to give

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,049
good sources where I where I've seen

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,970
them and so then this slide deck will be

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,610
available on SlideShare as we finish

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,479
sometime this evening so let's get

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,880
started um so the three minute version

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,110
in case you want to catch one of the

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,130
other sessions that are going on right

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,030
now the world is getting more webos the

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,840
web is getting less web ish there's a

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,210
lot of change coming the connected world

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,250
has one though and we understand that

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,170
world which means there are a lot of

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,420
opportunities for all of us here in this

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,380
room so what we're covering so i'm going

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,209
to talk through some of the forces that

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,310
are changing a medium starting way down

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,380
in the hardware level and then talk

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,760
about interfaces and software and so

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,330
these trends in the open web and big

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,560
data and hopefully it helps all of us

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,720
just have some more awareness around

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,290
these different things some possible

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,790
outcomes and I'm going to make some you

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,600
know guesses as to where that future

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,460
means and what we can do with that today

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,900
so I'm not covering anything about even

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,310
though we've got user experience in the

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,010
title I'm not talking about anything

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,020
with UI design techniques or process and

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,730
user experience sort of disciplines and

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,290
such and if you were expecting that I

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,490
will not be offended at all if you go

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,040
find something that'll be higher value

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,930
for you so mean that's it's okay oh come

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,910
on down plenty plenty room we got bunch

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,650
of chairs on all the sides be friendly

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,670
for the people coming in so with each of

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,460
those forces hardware software

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,700
interfaces etc I'm going to talk a

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,070
little bit about what's happening give

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,960
an analogy in our example some

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,850
implications and or predictions about

00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,380
what I think that means and ways to

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,610
start preparing now know so before we

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,680
get too far in though I just want to

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,370
talk about the but the very idea of

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,300
predicting the future can be Trixie so

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,890
we're going to look at a couple of

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,070
examples just to sort of liq level set

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,460
ourselves here starting back with Thomas

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,820
Edison 120 s years ago Thomas Edison

00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,100
known to be quite intelligent and he got

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,840
a number of things right one of the

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,230
things he thought was going to happen

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,600
was that alternate current AC the thing

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,400
that we use every day was never ever

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,500
going to take off he was convinced it

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,240
was a terrible waste of time no one was

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:55,140
ever going to use it this gentleman ran

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,600
a yes exactly he ran a vacuum cleaner

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,600
company and he was pretty sure in 1955

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,660
that in 1965 we would definitely have

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,530
the vacuum cleaners powered by nuclear

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:11,250
power kind of off right getting closer

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,780
and closer to our era 1977 the chairman

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,700
of the digital equipment corporation

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,290
deck was he knew that there was never

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,710
going to be any need or purpose or

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,690
reason for any of us to have a personal

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,310
computer and this is somebody you don't

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,420
gigan

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,150
presumably out to be well informed and

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,020
aware of things happening in the space

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:36,740
and this gentleman actually is

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:41,610
co-founder or co-inventor of Ethernet in

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:45,990
1995 he knew that the whole internet

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,330
thing was going to be done in 1996 went

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,680
on founded 3.com again and then we you

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,520
know are getting getting even closer

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,310
some of us might remember this moment

00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:00,810
Steve Ballmer declaring iphone as silly

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,900
never going to get anywhere similarly I

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,460
think there is a reasonable chance that

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,770
I will say something really dumb and

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,960
hopefully it's only just one thing so

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,310
with that in mind well go ahead get so

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,260
actually one other little sort of level

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,210
set here I'm occasionally using

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,280
analogies to explain what I think will

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,340
be happening and and this is what Freud

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,220
thought of analogies useless but maybe

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,790
they make you feel better so with all of

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:31,500
that said we'll jump into it so if we

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,730
look ahead in the future to hardware one

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,890
of the things that has been present in

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,080
all of our sort of digital lives and I'm

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,290
starting at a very low level here but I

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,230
think it trickles up we've all lived

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,610
with Moore's Law quote unquote and it's

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,570
been called a law even though it should

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,500
probably have been called a rule of

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:52,230
thumb or handy guide line by 2021

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,720
Moore's Law is broken Moore's Law is the

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,280
concept that every two years processor

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,150
speed can pretty reliably double and

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,180
that has a lot of impact in all the

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,380
planning of all kinds of things like

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,760
planning for device obsolescence

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,620
planning for new versions of software

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,120
and higher use like performance needs

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,430
etc and I think there's two reasons that

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,920
Moore's law will be broken about 20 21

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,670
the first is is kind of easy it's kind

00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:26,460
of a gimme it's physics right now we are

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:28,260
at the either 10 or 20 oops no I think

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,480
we're like bridging the gap we're headed

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,430
towards 10 nanometers per for the size

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,010
for a circuit on a chip which is really

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,540
really small like 10 nanometers like

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,070
that's like you know I don't know what's

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,870
relationship to a human hair but

00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:44,100
it's tiny at five nanometers

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,770
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle takes

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:51,360
over and that means you don't know where

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,890
the thing is and that's bad when you're

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,180
dealing with a binary supposedly binary

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,600
system if you can't tell where the thing

00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,330
is it's an issue but I think one of the

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,190
other reasons that will see hardware

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,650
slowing is we're rapidly arriving at the

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,610
point of good enough and for that I want

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,330
just take an analogy from their

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,360
airplanes and this is this comes by way

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,160
of this person whose accident somebody

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,020
here might know how to pronounce Zenda

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,420
here howdy okay watch exhib wolf ski wow

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,130
thank you I've like used this a couple

00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,030
times I've never known I've never dared

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:30,540
it watching say say guelph ski thank you

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:35,580
sir um they get this talk in at web

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:38,580
stock in 2014 about airplanes and he

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:42,900
makes the comparison to the fact that in

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,540
the 1930s we had I forget which one but

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,630
like 1930s 1940s 1950s like the stradder

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:52,500
cruiser dc-3 and 707 and this is sort of

00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,330
ever-changing speeding up doubling

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,550
capacity doubling a distance all these

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,100
things for the airlines by the point in

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,940
the 1950s where this had gone on for say

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,700
about 30 years it was very obvious that

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,730
the next great leap was going to be to

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,920
the moon and so Pan Am amongst other

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,320
companies started selling tickets to the

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,840
moon you could give you the early ticket

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,750
you know here we are Etta be Richards

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,000
signed up to be on one of those early

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,390
moon plates and they took these you know

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,920
certificate seen you get them and all of

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,570
the major engineers at all of the

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,020
aerospace companies were working on

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:34,680
supersonic and Beyond flights and as

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,979
those projects went longer and you know

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,270
scope creep and slower and delays and

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,660
delays I none of that sounds familiar to

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,250
anybody but they realized they were not

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,670
going to get there quick enough and so

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,900
the aircraft that they built instead

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,730
they put the basically the bad news

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,380
bears team of engineer

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,180
the people who weren't really good just

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,149
kind of good they took all those people

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,970
have said build the stopgap and they

00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:03,120
came up with a 737 which is basically

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,120
the same airplane we still fly 40 years

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,730
later because it's good enough it works

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,279
pretty well I I came from Minnesota for

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,019
this it took me like 10 hours or

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,370
something like that that's a third of

00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:19,800
the way across the globe it's pretty

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:23,250
good so similarly for a lot of what

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,620
we're doing on a regular basis we have

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,529
an amazing amount of computing power in

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,930
these little devices and a huge amount

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,610
of what we do on this is is not really

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,139
very processor intensive it's like

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,910
looking at pictures i'm going to

00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:47,100
internet and it's good enough for that

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:48,540
so clicking so in 2021 the doubling of

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,470
speed I mean this is a good I think very

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,779
known thing actual it's not

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,060
controversial the the doubling of speed

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,800
is no longer the focus you start having

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,930
a lot more focused chipsets this is

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,209
already happening cpus are giving away

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,690
two GPUs for very specialized things and

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:05,310
that will that trend will continue the

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,620
next problems are going to be about

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,560
different things its efficiency its

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,699
battery life its connectivity in a world

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,089
where all these devices are speaking to

00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:15,959
each other it's efficiently using

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,540
officially connecting to other things

00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,970
and increasingly we are going to see a

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,720
world with many specialized chipsets and

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,760
chips for solving specialized problems

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,750
leading to more specialized devices all

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,149
right and this isn't to say that there

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:34,250
won't be still advances in speed and

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,060
things like that but a huge amount of

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,769
that we've built this massive

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,620
infrastructure reduce very fast chips

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,600
and they're going to be good enough and

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,740
then we're going to tweak them and make

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,910
them again very specialized in very

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,380
focused and that's going to sell

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:52,350
accelerate the trend of the Internet of

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:54,839
Things so what does that mean this is

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,130
probably the most abstract 14 for all of

00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,490
us here that do the web maybe hardware

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,709
is a long ways away but the point I want

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,820
to make here is that as we all have more

00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:06,540
and more devices and I'm actually

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,850
stepping back how many people here have

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,090
one device on them with them right now

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,020
connected to the internet and raising

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,310
okay so one so yeah the excellent point

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,590
Kathy I like where you're going with

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,030
that that for the record for the

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,440
Internet audience that was every hand I

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:27,310
think pretty much learn how many people

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,460
have to internet devices just just to

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,630
just do wow that's like their the thirty

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:37,300
percent I'll go with three or more

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,580
devices we've got 50 yeah right here

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,190
right we'll go pity how many brought to

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:46,120
Dublin for those you're not local four

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,560
or more internet connecting things it's

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,080
tricky because I brought a kindle right

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,240
exactly I like thought I was

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,360
disqualified yeah I whoops that's it's

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,930
absolutely that's actually kind of crazy

00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,390
if you go back like 10 years and think

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,400
that you would bring more than one

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,640
device that connects to the internet

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,710
that that's just like weird like it's

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,770
not that long ago that we didn't have

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,020
the iphone this 2007 2006 like like and

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,930
now here we are and we just sort of

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,220
forget that you have another device that

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,980
connects to either the internet or

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,910
something else and as this goes not

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,750
everything is going to connect to the

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,220
internet some things are going to

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,590
connect locally so anybody running fit

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,540
bids or you know sort of fitness kinds

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,010
of things super common we're going to

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,390
see that happening more and more there's

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,100
already sort of early prototypes where

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,900
you know your shoes are going to have a

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,250
chip in them to tell you that that's

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,460
time to replace them or you've walked so

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,830
many steps or other things like that but

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,680
this connected world I think offers a

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:47,080
lot of opportunity for us if we can

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,120
think beyond our traditional interfaces

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,550
of screens and such we understand how

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,640
this world works this is the world gets

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,310
more webos and our web ish skills are

00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,010
strong so well we'll talk about I think

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,890
maybe has you know sometimes jane change

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,330
mystic scary but i think we should i

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,810
think fundamentally feel optimistic

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:10,960
about our abilities and understanding

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:14,170
for this world so with the proliferation

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,160
of devices we get many many many many

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:20,430
more interfaces

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,120
and so the on screens interfaces

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,070
multiply so we will see obviously we're

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,560
already used to the idea that we've got

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,170
different form factors of mobile devices

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,570
things with screens but moving away from

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,000
screens we are increasingly going to see

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:39,140
other things as well so audible

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,149
interfaces or augmented reality that our

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,380
visual overlays on the world yeah many

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,360
of the interfaces that will be there

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,860
will be not to human beings will be you

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,370
know talking to other devices so api's

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:57,120
and such and as an example I want to

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:58,470
talk about one of those and the world

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,540
will be seamless too because when you

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,350
click here it will definitely always

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:08,510
move that oh except for make sure my

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:12,930
thing is open I Paul go back to clicking

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:15,630
so all right so augmented reality how

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,800
many have heard of this concept like all

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,950
I'm going to realities anybody recognize

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,339
what this is all right all right so if

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,890
you see me light so I play pokemon go I

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,029
I started because two reasons 1i have

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,140
children that got me into it but then

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,350
also I think it's a really interesting

00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,440
example so this is an example of walking

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,690
down a sidewalk and then there's this

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,029
digital overlay in the world and in this

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:42,779
case Pokemon is purely entertainment

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:45,269
right there's no greater purpose your

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,339
other than amusement maybe a little bit

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,839
of exercise but what happens with this

00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,829
is that you you know you're walking

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,660
around you see a thing you catch it

00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:56,399
whatever trivial but I think it's really

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,170
interesting because it's one of the is I

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,839
think augmented reality's going to sneak

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,350
up us sneak up on us faster than we

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:07,620
expect these you know using devices that

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,820
are location and context-aware and task

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,790
going to it again the task here is

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,519
entertainment we're going to

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,279
increasingly work in a world where the

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,730
digital world is not really separate

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,430
from the real world like digital stuff

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,339
is real it is i mean its electrons it's

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,680
like a fundamental level it is real and

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:32,660
I think that distinction over time

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,950
will mean less and less perhaps so

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,420
augmented reality you know and Google

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,520
glass was you know an example of this

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,660
there was a backlash against it that's

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,920
not going to be the last time that

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:48,720
experiment happens and it will

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,060
eventually take off another interface I

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,860
want to talk about is is audible and

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,850
what we're going to see here is actually

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,100
something that three showed in the

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,750
keynote and the dreese note in New

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,600
Orleans but I think it's a really

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,430
interesting example especially for those

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,800
of us who design websites so what we're

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:10,290
going to see is the example of using the

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:15,029
website by voice so let's take a look as

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:17,430
for bargain sale today we have hundreds

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:23,640
of stores what's your zip code so i have

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:25,740
you locate the barest 1904 to here's the

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,010
fruit that's on sale and gourmet market

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,010
on 77 in broadway apples are currently

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,709
fifty cents a pound bananas are on sale

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:40,580
for twenty cents each anything else I

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:40,580
can help with there's an Austin Austin

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:49,580
so he asked a question we're gonna see

00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:54,880
the computers talking the call to some

00:16:49,580 --> 00:17:00,250
code drupal choose on that says okay

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,250
interesting request sends it back

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,610
awesomesauce season on sale right now

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:11,089
but I'll how to buy you what it is what

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:15,110
is your phone number thanks Evan 85 95

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:17,179
for 240 it's not as actual phone number

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,510
I let you know who knows who sauces on

00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,510
sale

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,829
marking the product on sale

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:44,170
and make a purchase that and we can have

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:48,520
the lights back up thank you that was a

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:50,770
website that's a little weird and that's

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,410
a little bit crazy perhaps like how many

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:57,900
of us have ever designed a website that

00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:00,700
you speak at that you don't click on

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,490
this is this is kind of crazy right i

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,750
mean this is i think potentially

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,690
something that you know could be bit

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,910
jarring like wait but i think you know

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,590
cody coming ahead to some of the things

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,740
i'll be talking about like if you think

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:18,910
of yourself as a web designer that deals

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,320
with screens futures like new jarring if

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,370
you think of yourself as an interface

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:31,150
designer who solves problems for users

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:32,920
it's the same old thing so one of the

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,180
things that we know will happen and i'll

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,760
talk about this in a couple situations

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,940
but is something so here's here's one of

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,850
my another analogy here and this comes

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:46,360
you know via a i won't read the URL but

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:48,130
it's you know a website that has you

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,940
know sort of whoops moments in mobile

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,590
web and we've all seen this and the

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,750
point I want to make with this is that

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,020
in a world where we have a proliferation

00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,870
of devices and proliferation of

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:06,640
experiences it makes having a central

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:08,800
place to access and store the logic and

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,330
the content of those things even more

00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,180
important and in this page you say here

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,150
we're looking at something that is you

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,980
know view the mobile site and and you

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,900
get to the help page and says whoops we

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,580
didn't we didn't translate this stuff

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,200
over you have to go back to the other

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,480
site in order to get this content we've

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,550
all I'm sure seeing this experience and

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,320
we know it sucks and it's terrible for

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:34,210
everybody's bad for the users it's bad

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:36,520
for the people administering it and that

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,020
won't be the future we won't have 38

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,370
different for you know if we have 38

00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,470
devices we won't have 38 different

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,550
things that are the sources and so

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,970
central content hub becomes even more

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,200
important in this world and I think in

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,790
the future multi

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,640
what I'm calling multi-channel delivery

00:19:51,790 --> 00:20:03,750
is even more more important so web apps

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:07,000
overlays audible etc and that's normal

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:10,330
so this is a little bit closer to us

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,330
what can we do now like the this this

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,580
stuff is actually it's you like we can

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,860
start playing with this already so if

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:21,070
you're so the concept of headless drupal

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,810
using drupal to display to power up

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,400
front end or some multiple numbers of

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,400
fraud ends with a single set of

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,260
information if you're not already doing

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,880
integrations in AP increasingly sites

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,920
will be about integrations and api's and

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,950
so you should be doing that in every

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,960
site build be thinking about web

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,990
applications and getting your content

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,880
elsewhere and if you started down this

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:46,510
path I would encourage you to double

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,190
down and if you haven't it's time to get

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,090
moving it's time to start exploring

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,810
these technologies and trying them out

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,310
understanding these patterns and how

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,350
they work in the ins and outs will serve

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,850
you very very well and all of us very

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,930
very well in the future and happily

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:04,480
again drupal has we're in a good place

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,310
for this we we've we've seen this world

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,810
and we've tried to prepare for as much

00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,660
as we can at least on the technology

00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:16,890
layer now may be time for us to be all

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:16,890
thinking about this a little bit more so

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:26,560
software as Hardware slows software

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,270
gross right and the cloud will be the

00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,010
new normal software as a service will

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,790
increase and services will be

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:37,330
increasingly commoditized and and as an

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:39,160
example here I I wanted to highlight

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,770
something as a search i did back in

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,760
march of this year in the united states

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,490
you might have heard we're having an

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:49,060
election amongst some interesting people

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,640
at one point in time i googled the

00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,930
primary results and I saw a delegate

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,880
count right details don't really matter

00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,790
the thing didn't note and notice and

00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,520
maybe sort of register is that this is

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:07,270
being done within the Google interface

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,070
there are many sites that are porting on

00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,830
this doing their own graphs everything

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,860
else this however is a great user

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,860
experience I went to one place I type

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,360
something in and I got my instant

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,760
results I think it maybe even have a

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,720
little bit of animation right here and

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,460
that's a great user experience however

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,890
for those of us are on the processor in

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,230
the business of building websites that

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,670
might report these things this is also

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,410
perhaps a little bit jarring what what

00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,140
do we do if we're kind of cut out of

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:43,390
this loop again I think it's okay i

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,800
think there's there's hope here but i

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:49,570
want to look at another example as well

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:53,260
so so if we look at this this is a me

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,370
searching for a thai curry house and if

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,500
you ever happen to make it to minute

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,380
minneapolis i highly recommend it it's

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,600
really good this is what happens if you

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,230
go to their website this is what happens

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,820
if you if you if you just have the

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,910
google page and so on the left-hand side

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,850
over here i have a picture and such and

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:16,540
not a lot of content the phone number is

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,700
a picture of the phone number so i can't

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:23,110
even if i want to call make reservations

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:26,170
whereas over here I have some pictures I

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,820
can see the map that's great one click

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,980
interface it's sort of a common format

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,340
tells me the address I got the cliq for

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:36,070
the phone number even knows if it's open

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:40,240
this is really really nice that's a

00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:44,800
great user experience and it's fast but

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,600
that's also sort of scary so I realized

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,950
the fonts are messing actually someone

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,850
warned me about this and I didn't solve

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:56,740
it beforehand oops so so some

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:57,910
implications predicted I think I should

00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,740
probably reverse the order of these

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,480
things shallow projects have less value

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,870
if you are in the business of building

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:10,800
websites for restaurants or other highly

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:12,910
commoditize abul services industries etc

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,909
you're going to have a harder and harder

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,009
time in this world

00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:20,559
commoditize abul clients and markets

00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:23,109
will have you know custom like there

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,409
will be a common application if it

00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:28,119
doesn't already exist for these

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:30,369
organizations to use that can produce a

00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,789
website quickly for you know restaurants

00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:35,230
and and there's nothing you know

00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:38,049
interestingly enough there's nothing

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:42,340
that prevents Google say from opening up

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:43,960
tomorrow restaurants google com and it's

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,769
a google form they already invented that

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,259
and you fill in all of your basic

00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:53,289
information upload some images click

00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:55,210
publish and it produces that page right

00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:58,779
that page with results and you're done

00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,159
half an hour later google could do that

00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:01,980
very quickly and they have done that

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,820
kind of thing there are there are

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,529
commoditize about clydes there and

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,659
services they've kind of wiped out when

00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:13,090
they add interface improvements and

00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:14,859
conveniences i think all of this and

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,440
this relates to actually to my first

00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:20,739
example will will get us to a point

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,350
though where search and soulful end up

00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:27,309
being regulated so if you think back to

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:29,830
the first example politics and

00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:31,869
politicians are certain in governments

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,039
are occasionally slow-moving i don't

00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:34,629
know if anybody here has ever had the

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,730
chance to work with government for a

00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:38,739
client sometimes or maybe works in

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,509
government I certainly have done a fair

00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,899
share of that and I have observed that

00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:47,230
they are occasionally slow-moving

00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:50,139
however i think when under threat they

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,210
move quickly and so knowing that google

00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:54,519
for example could skew election results

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,470
or facebook could do the same i think

00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,309
will lead to a world where algorithms

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:04,950
and results are in some way audited and

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:08,259
regulated so what do we do about that so

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,580
i think to the extent that you're

00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:13,389
working with what i'm calling to

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,850
monetizable clients like restaurants you

00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:17,590
need to get out or go deep so shallow

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,539
projects no more if you're just

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:24,399
producing the website for the thai curry

00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:25,910
house in in minneapolis it's it's it's

00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:29,570
not going to be a great

00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:31,070
prospect going forward however in this

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,720
interconnected world there are going to

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,600
be more and more ways for us to go deep

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,060
and so to understand the problems that

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,530
restaurants face whether it's

00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,320
forecasting demand or ordering supplies

00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,490
or integrating with mobile devices so

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,720
that someone walks by and they smell and

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,030
they're like oh that's really great I

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,000
wonder what that is and oh it's open and

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:53,600
it's on sale producing experiences like

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,930
that there'll be a huge amount of value

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,310
in that and so specializing and finding

00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,930
a vertical and understanding it deeply

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,490
and serving it well I think there are

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,830
going to be lots and lots and lots and

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,170
lots and lots of opportunities and

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:14,150
someone's going to do it so might as

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:16,460
well be us I vote us similarly the

00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,340
concept of the open web is something

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,360
that we've been talking about and

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,730
there's been a lot of posts on this

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,750
recently and I think I think there's

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:29,720
it's important that we take the threat

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,130
to the open web seriously it because

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,230
it's very real and the open web is the

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,740
idea that what's happened over time is

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:38,870
that Facebook and Google and Apple and

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,150
Amazon and others have kind of grown up

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,530
and are eating more and more of the

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,460
internet track more and more time is

00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,290
being spent on these things and they're

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,490
being done as well gardens right where

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,810
we used to have like just lots and lots

00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,700
of little mobile or little web sites

00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,380
that we all kind of bounced around more

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,190
and more time is being spent on these

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:58,040
applications and I think however i think

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,200
the open web will will will pull out of

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,320
this we will still like there is a space

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,450
for us and i think one of the reasons I

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,440
think that is I think back to our past

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,450
for those of us who have been around

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,560
we've seen something like this before in

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:14,270
some ways so back in 1998 we had the

00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,790
browser Wars again like there's this two

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,160
big forces internet explorer and

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:23,540
Netscape they were competing to own the

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:25,790
web in a different kind of way but it

00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,890
was frustrating and annoying and what

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:31,220
not at the point at which i ii started

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:32,420
pulling ahead there had been no sorry

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,010
there's been a movement growing in the

00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,260
background which was that of the web

00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,730
standards project we don't need two

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,710
different ways to do everything we do

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,030
need four different ways on one for

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,810
Google one for facebook 14 however that

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,740
you know we just let us do it one way

00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,990
that was called a web standards project

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,630
and as soon as I II started pulling

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,790
ahead Netscape which had been equally

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:55,490
dismissive of the effort up until that

00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,290
point said hey wait that's no good IE

00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:01,580
you're not following standards jumped on

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:03,950
board I think that same thing will

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,210
happen with the open web the the losers

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,040
to the extent that there are losers in

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,760
between Google and Amazon and you know

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,050
all these other major forces at some

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,150
point they will feel threatened they're

00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:16,520
going to be you know judging themselves

00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,410
that like they don't want to fail

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:24,170
they're going to support a common sort

00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:26,890
of the open web basically and and so I

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,750
think we do in fact have a future here

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,340
and I also think that means for us all

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,350
of us doing this I think we don't need

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,170
to worry too much about proprietary

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,300
formats so things like accelerate

00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:42,800
multiple pages which is Google's format

00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:45,680
or Facebook I in turn nets are what

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,600
what's Facebook's one instant articles

00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,120
thank you I went with internet there and

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,370
it threw me off and there are others you

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,770
know others will emerge I would advise

00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,870
us as individuals and as a community to

00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,070
not really sweat it too much now i

00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,660
happen to know some of the people who

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,490
worked on the google amp module has

00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,440
anyone used it by the way i said when i

00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,580
tried creating excel remote places i

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,170
think it's actually a great i mean

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,910
definitely experiment with it if you

00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:10,070
have clients that are looking to do it

00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:13,100
go ahead and try it but i don't think we

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:16,730
need to get caught up too much in the

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,550
particulars of a you know like a

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,320
specific vendor you know Google's format

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,690
for the future Facebook's format for the

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,050
future because I think ultimately those

00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:30,500
things aren't going to have huge

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:32,360
lifespan on the other hand if you can

00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,060
get paid to produce the Google amp

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,780
module like I you know some wonderful

00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,980
people did that's awesome good job and I

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,030
would encourage us all to be a little

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:48,380
bit cautious of single vendor solutions

00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:49,550
so in terms of like readiness and

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,450
awareness it's really just about

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,650
weariness and supporting

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,470
educating ourselves to what the open web

00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,900
means and supporting it and realizing

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:02,310
that's important to all of our futures

00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,310
and supporting it as an emergency

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:12,940
closely related to the open web is that

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:14,620
of a the big data so all of this

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:20,530
activity is producing mountains of data

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:24,070
and you know open source has one when I

00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:26,800
started in this business open source was

00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:29,290
a passion and a philosophy that was

00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,120
challenged regularly and you would

00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,280
occasionally have to say no this is a

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,130
better way to do things and and now

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:42,880
that's happened I think as a as a

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:44,170
community of open source people one of

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,260
the things that we might be maybe didn't

00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:49,360
appreciate that was going to happen was

00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,000
the rise and importance of data so we

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,530
have PHP we have this you know amazing

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,210
tools like gets to produce code and and

00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,040
collaborate and we've thought maybe a

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,900
little bit less about the MySQL side of

00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,090
things right all of this is producing

00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,480
mountains and mountains of data and it's

00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:09,340
getting stored away somewhere and that's

00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,810
basically that you know the problem big

00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,710
data all of this interaction is all

00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:18,370
producing digital trails of people and I

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:22,750
think so in 2013 Edward Snowden came out

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:24,430
and said look terrible I didn't say he

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,520
released a lot of information

00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:29,860
demonstrating some pretty bad behavior

00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,690
on the part of the US government like

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:35,230
that was a lot of invasive information

00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:37,060
being collected the US government is not

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:40,540
the only organization collecting a lot

00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:43,720
of data and I think we will see more and

00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:47,530
more sort of releases like this and I

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,420
think excellent skipper search my owner

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,370
for a second I think whether or not it

00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:56,290
is done deliberately by Edward Snowden

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:58,330
or it is by virtue of you know just bad

00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,440
security things being leaked this is

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,900
actually from a website called

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,190
information is beautiful it's the

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,429
world's biggest data breaches

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:10,490
and it's a pretty amazing thing to look

00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:13,460
at so you know the subtitle here is

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:16,909
selected losses greater than 30,000

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:22,549
records myspace who knew there's a stole

00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:25,580
thing that looks like a 160 464 million

00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:27,830
records 55 million records voted in 191

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,480
million records 80 million records this

00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,279
is a lot of records being released on a

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,870
regular basis and it's like there's a

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,090
couple different ways to to sort this

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,970
and everything it's really fascinating

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:40,210
visualization to play with but more and

00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,230
more of this will happen and and

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,440
building up the pressure against that

00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:50,629
will be organizations like the European

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,779
Union who say enough is enough and this

00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:55,460
is actually something so the GDP are is

00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:58,279
anyone familiar or heard of this is a

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,460
thing yeah I mean go EU I happen to live

00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,080
in the United States I really so the

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,169
European Union is ahead of us I think in

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,879
many ways in regards to data privacy but

00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,460
this will increasingly be the way the

00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,960
world goes everyone has the right to

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,579
protection of their personal data

00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,950
because that's the way it should be and

00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:19,819
because I think as we increasingly see

00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:25,099
the implications of not this we won't

00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:26,659
stand for it so what's that mean for us

00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:28,579
well I mean like how many most of us

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:30,169
don't protect you know build websites

00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:32,359
well maybe someones do with 80 million

00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:36,560
records or 100 million records or things

00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:39,169
like that it turns out that that doesn't

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,060
matter like actually hackers the forces

00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:43,849
of evil that are out there trying to get

00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:48,139
that websites are just as interested in

00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:50,480
the your little drupal site as a big one

00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:53,599
and these attacks are increasing

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,579
automated and whatnot and so educating

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,680
yourself on data security and security

00:34:55,579 --> 00:35:00,140
and Drupal and specific and all things

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,300
related to web security internet

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,310
security is just a powerful thing for

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,770
your future and something that you

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,030
should be paying attention to understand

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,750
what personally identifiable information

00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:13,990
is and do your best to protect it and

00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,190
you know read along those lines and

00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,880
support data privacy standards as they

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,980
happen

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,920
you know point if you live if you live

00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,450
in the EU and you you can talk to

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,460
representatives about you know the GDP

00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,870
are is a good thing do so if you live in

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,880
the US or elsewhere in the world and say

00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:38,280
you know this is the thing this is the

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:41,460
future it is the way it should be so was

00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,740
it saw me for the web in 2021 well I

00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,210
think the web in 2021 is a lot less

00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,830
special this is regular it's like the

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:53,850
you know so if you think of yourself as

00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:57,480
a web designer or a web developer or a

00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:01,670
web firm or web agency anything like

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,320
that your your future is is I think

00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,870
narrow but if you think about yourself

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,730
as a designer or a problem solver or an

00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:12,300
agency that helps you know restaurants

00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:20,370
solve problems your future is really

00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:23,610
really quite bright so again we know how

00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:25,290
to do this we deeply understand an

00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,510
interconnected world model it's what

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,220
we've all been working on both in terms

00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,480
of what we build and how we operate to

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,800
as a community as a group of people

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,240
building a software together we know how

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,630
to assemble around causes and we know

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,450
how to push technology forward so I

00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,610
would encourage all of us as we sort of

00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,980
like look to the future and reflect on

00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:50,520
what's next and such to think beyond

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:54,870
screens to think beyond what is narrowly

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,450
called the web today with the optimism

00:36:54,870 --> 00:37:01,440
knowing that our web ish skills are

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:03,360
really strong so again conclusion back

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,640
to that three minutes the world is

00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:10,760
getting more web 'ish the web less so

00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,050
there's a lot of change coming though

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,640
but we know how to deal with that kind

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,620
we know how to deal with this world you

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,790
and we I think should fundamentally feel

00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:23,340
like we have a lot of opportunity in

00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:26,210
this coming world and that's what I

00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,210
wanted to talk about today

00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:39,090
so we do have I think plenty of time for

00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,040
questions which is the like way I like

00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,140
to do things because I've talked enough

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,150
so do you have questions please come up

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,160
to the mic and i'm just going to also

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,870
mention well people were maybe going to

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,510
the mic too please join us all for

00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:55,830
contributions prints that are happening

00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:59,460
there's a first-time sprinter workshop

00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:03,120
uh that doesn't have the date that's not

00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,190
helpful it's it's all friday i clearly

00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,370
missed that on my copy paste of the

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,390
slides anyways on Friday we have sprints

00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,740
you know other sessions will also have

00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,040
this information but please join us and

00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,330
the last thing I'd like to say is both

00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,630
this session and every other session you

00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:21,860
attend please evaluate it it's helpful

00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,760
we all get better when we get evaluated

00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:29,580
the questions does anybody have

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,840
questions oops oh and so please yeah

00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,390
please if you have questions please go

00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:37,200
to the mic so that the the future world

00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:41,000
can know what the question was this is

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,760
working how do you think the web will

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,920
spread into the automotive world course

00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,890
itself because that's everybody uses not

00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,590
as well because what because that's the

00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:56,400
stuff that everyone uses as well yeah

00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:59,340
yeah so I've strong opinions about car

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,400
interfaces does anyone have a car with

00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:06,570
like a interface that's kind of mediocre

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,090
I do it's of starting like car companies

00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:12,330
came to get out of the business of

00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:19,020
building interfaces that are lousy I

00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:20,550
think I think over the short term my any

00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,620
like their security implications and all

00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:25,200
kinds of issues with car companies

00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:26,550
building blousy software that is

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,840
connected to the internet and can turn

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:32,040
off your car for example it's a bad idea

00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,170
probably what will happen over the

00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,420
medium term is that we'll see more and

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:39,750
more Android devices that

00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,180
are becoming replace the that lousy

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:47,340
experience there will be some iOS as

00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:48,870
well but I think this kind of comes back

00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,340
to the open web and that the like sort

00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:54,180
of converging world the difference

00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:56,730
between say a Drupal application and

00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:00,120
what an Android experience you get today

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:02,520
is is going to be shrinking so we so

00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,830
driessen the keynote showed the

00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,080
refreshness module for example is sort

00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,550
of experimental module 4 / drupal that

00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,250
gives you a little bit more of that the

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:14,340
you know fast user experience that you

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:19,350
get in a native device out and so I

00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:21,480
think you know like could so going out

00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,610
five years who knows what that will be

00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,740
but you know it will be some technology

00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:36,150
not like what it is right now because

00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:37,650
it's garbage yeah yeah okay so the

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,660
question is do you think web apps or

00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,850
native apps will win see that like these

00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,080
are hard questions so we had anybody

00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,410
have been easy ones like what's my

00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,410
favorite color

00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,850
yeah so I'll repeat I'll repeat so yeah

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,020
it's helpful actually seriously it is

00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,390
it's helpful for everyone else in the

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,400
room but I'll do my best to repeat so

00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,250
five years ago the gentleman was saying

00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,650
he he didn't think native apps were

00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,570
going to take off because you know we do

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:19,600
web things hopefully the web stuff takes

00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:22,240
off yet obviously for those of us who

00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,340
you know use smart phones and smart

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,230
devices which is probably all of us we

00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:39,400
have a regular experience of using apps

00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:42,760
hello and which one is going to win I I

00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,030
hope web apps do or something that's

00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,360
between them because increasingly so so

00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:54,280
against the native apps there's some

00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,480
economics ana and I mean so I think it's

00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,170
not ridiculous to think that web apps

00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,630
could win and will win and and it's

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:05,830
largely because has anyone here produced

00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:10,450
a native app iOS Android yeah cool good

00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:13,240
that's good definitely do some it's very

00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,350
expensive to produce it in both like so

00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,340
there are tools like PhoneGap and other

00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:19,030
things like that will allow you to

00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:22,480
produce for both iOS and Android but

00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:26,800
they're not quite as crisp and so

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:29,020
producing different apps for iOS and

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,530
Android and other things and the website

00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,570
which also has to do the things is looks

00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:38,410
a little to me like building the website

00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:40,600
for netscape optimized Internet Explorer

00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:43,600
optimized except much worse like the

00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,400
it's non-trivial costs to deliver a

00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,300
separate technology in each of these

00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,010
channels and at the point where the web

00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,410
experience can match a native

00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:55,120
application which can't quite again like

00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,400
things like the Refresh lyst model are

00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,890
really interesting and it's sort of like

00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,870
I think headed towards our future at the

00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,510
point in which we can legitimately

00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:06,700
produce an experience that doesn't

00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,590
require a whole separate bill design

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,970
process for Android whole separate bill

00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,900
design

00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:16,050
processor for iOS the web has it you

00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,150
know the economic advantage there we're

00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:21,359
going to make a thing it's going to be

00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:23,220
universally accessible and by the way we

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,140
are going to build it in such a way that

00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:29,820
audible interfaces work and other things

00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:31,830
like that to do you see any change in

00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:36,150
the media competence of the people

00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:40,650
example given Facebook just I think

00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:42,840
incorporated an algorithm for what's new

00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:46,400
what's up what's going on on facebook so

00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:50,130
throwing away all the human edited

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:53,940
contents mhm so my personal concern is

00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:58,260
people will kind of not learn the

00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:01,410
difference between media so youth will

00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,840
grow up within smartphone not really

00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:06,390
using the computer and seeing something

00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,540
happening on their smartphone thinking

00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:12,599
and thinking it it's real so where does

00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:16,440
it come from comes it from a publicly

00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:20,540
funded news site comes it from a Russian

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:24,690
or American use side and so on yeah so

00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:27,920
this is uh this is I think that scary

00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:30,690
scenario is very real and it will happen

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,240
and that will again cause governments to

00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:35,690
move quickly to provide clarity and I do

00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,950
think that will be governmentally lead

00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:39,869
because again i think that fundamentally

00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,599
threatening to governments and

00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:44,040
politicians who go through elections and

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,119
you know stability of economies and

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,990
other things like that is the world

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,710
increasingly relies on digital mobile

00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:55,020
communications something that is

00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,450
maliciously done or even slightly sort

00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,790
of tweaked all of a sudden you know like

00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:02,160
again back to my initial example in the

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,330
united states that for several years in

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,260
many different places in the United

00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:06,630
States many different levels of

00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:11,849
elections there's just a few votes and

00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:13,530
if you are acting on behalf of one of

00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:15,540
those groups to push it one way or the

00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,750
other for example that's a huge amount

00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:21,359
of power and so I think we will have

00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,650
regulation we will have some level of

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,210
oversight into

00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:28,470
these algorithms because they're too

00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:30,300
important to trust to the facebooks and

00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:33,540
again I think we've already seen some

00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,820
early trends in this the you know like

00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,190
people who are responsible for those

00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,600
algorithms and decisions and companies

00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,430
like Facebook have been called to

00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,370
congressional hearings to answer for are

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:49,940
you skewing things left and right and I

00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:52,380
think so I do believe that we will have

00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,830
is kind of like the next level of the

00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,090
gdp are right not only do we have a

00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,830
guarantee like right to our own

00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:02,840
information these digital trails that we

00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:04,920
leave in the internet in our activities

00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,870
we have a right to understanding

00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,550
something like open source of the

00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,550
algorithms that increasingly inform us

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:22,850
anyone else oh yeah oh where do I see

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,850
pantheon where do I see Pantheon in 2021

00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:30,140
yeah yeah yeah so there are definitely

00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:34,590
disruptors in the space I'm actually

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:37,920
optimistic for pantheon I mean I suppose

00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:40,140
that should be self-evident I think we

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,660
have a pretty awesome set of technology

00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:45,060
a really good group of people and the

00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,530
ability to iterate our technology

00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,730
forward but this is one of the reasons

00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,200
actually I'm spending time thinking

00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,840
about this because I think we need to be

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,580
prepared for a changing world but I

00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:59,700
think we can be the but you know time

00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,710
will tell we'll find out look check me

00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:08,370
out of the neck you know drupalcon 2021

00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:10,380
we'll chat about it okay and I got the

00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,620
time signal so thank you all very much

00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,620
