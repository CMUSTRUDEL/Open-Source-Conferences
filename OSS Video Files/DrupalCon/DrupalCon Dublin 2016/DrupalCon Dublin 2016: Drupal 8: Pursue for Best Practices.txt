Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	Drupal 8 is out in the wild and all the cool kids are playing with it. User's manual is about to be written though! This session will try to help experienced Drupal 7 site builders to make the smooth change to Drupal 8, without the need to forget everything they learned and start over from the scratch. The emphasis will be on evolution ofÂ config management and deployment best practices and their place in a new Drupal 8 world, including:

Do's and Don'ts with Drupal config management.
Installation profiles -- quick start guide for seasoned D7 site builders.
Features module and how it can get useful in D8 too!
Composer in Drupal realm.
Miscellaneous gotcha's and wtf's.
All the presented problems will be from real-world projects and it will be allowed for participants to challenge proposed solutions in a way that will produce new knowledge and ideas.

today's session is going to be about

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,740
well drupal 8 and pursue for best

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:14,150
practices whatever that is before we

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,500
begin I'm Branislav I'm a Drupal guy I

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,199
was actually a doctor guy before I

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,420
became a Drupal guy and I started

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,080
medicine and I had substantial IT

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,150
knowledge but I changed so now I have

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,550
hair and everything and I became a

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:34,950
developer guide with substantial medical

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,079
knowledge so it's a change I lived until

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:43,020
seven months ago in a beautiful city of

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,879
pancho in Serbia close to capital but

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,910
now I live in rhyme back in Germany

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,210
close to X capital so I changed I work

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,820
for a company called union between be ha

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,190
we are working for well for major German

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,080
political party and we are doing ite

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:08,790
internet printing and publishing so yes

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,080
with a lot of changes and thing is this

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,189
session is going to be a lot about

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,350
change management and how to embrace

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,080
libre changes but keep your identity

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:24,210
keep you know the ways you were doing

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:29,729
and of course in drupal 8 now drupal 8

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:32,759
gave us well Nucor new AP is 200 new

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,780
features new paradigms of coding

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,850
object-oriented coding proudly built

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:44,220
somewhere else and of course big so it

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,710
it yells out with the old it tells with

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,290
you know we need revolution we need to

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,720
forget everything with you and start all

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,170
over again and i really hated the

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,880
concept because well I learned Drupal

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,020
for 10 years and I don't want to forget

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,780
everything I want to you know start

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,939
building on top of Drupal 7 and drupal 7

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,129
practices and just learn something new

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,370
and it is really difficult because of

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,209
this forcing forced to change

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,459
engine to embrace total anything so

00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,920
let's start with goals you know we need

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,069
to focus on goals because kugels didn't

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,989
change and our goal is actually to do as

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,569
least as possible to build as best

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:32,010
product as possible for well and yeah

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:34,500
enjoy so and in order to do that well we

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,480
have good software design and that

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,110
problem was more or less already chain

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,390
fixed we have we know what to do we know

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,510
that we need to build software that is

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,530
good quality software that can be easily

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:53,370
maintained easily upgraded easily reused

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,459
and deployed and well programmers

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,010
invented design patterns and that's

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:03,870
awesome that more or less salts there

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:06,329
are problems because you know you have

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,220
patterns you know how to solve some

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:11,040
general problems using some general

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,840
patterns and that's it but it doesn't

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,169
really work with with Drupal because an

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,819
especially side building because we are

00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:22,109
working with visual programming with

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:24,450
settings and not really typing stuff so

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:28,709
that can be a little bit impractical for

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:34,019
for site building so we invented best

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:36,359
practices now they are similar to design

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:42,030
patterns only suggestions how to solve

00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:44,970
some problems but well design patterns

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,799
are unique for every programming

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,810
language every framework and best

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,870
practice is kind of framework conversion

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,109
specific meaning whenever you change a

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,000
framework you're working on you need to

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,260
review your best practices or even read

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,540
through them start from the scratch and

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,849
of course version specific which we know

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,419
in process of migration from Drupal 7 to

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:11,340
Drupal 8 and yeah they're also task

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:13,980
specific meaning that you know you don't

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,099
have that much design patterns in the

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,959
world but we do have a lot of best

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:21,450
practices depending on what do we really

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,120
try to achieve so I don't want to talk

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,230
about you know whether to use no taxes

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,480
or rabbit hole too so

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,870
problem that's that's too focused on on

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,180
a special task I want to talk about

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:37,350
general stuff and of course we don't

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,480
have any literature on best practices we

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,150
don't have any repository of best

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,000
practices and that's really a problem we

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,710
really don't know what is a best

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,340
practice is to practice to solve a

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:53,600
problem and what is not finally we are

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,940
not really sure if best practices exist

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,160
are they the best are they better

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,660
practices should we just stop searching

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:09,510
for better practices if well yeah grant

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,520
ones are the best so our first problem

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,740
or the biggest global problem we have is

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,110
well problem with deployment but not any

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,640
deployment because we don't care about

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,060
codes deployment that problem was solved

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:25,860
with get we care about copic deployment

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,990
now config deployment is generally

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,760
problem with with Drupal and there's

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,490
still a lot of companies who do manual

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:37,020
deployment are the people who are doing

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:40,110
manual deployment here don't be shy i'm

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,050
doing manual deployment also so

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,670
unfortunately we do a lot of manual

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,710
deployment these days even though its

00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,780
21st century and we have all those

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,480
beautiful tools so we invented something

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,040
that will prevent us for having to do

00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,680
stuff multiple times and reduce margin

00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,560
of error and well first thing I could

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,030
think of we created was hook update and

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,790
process who is using that a lot of

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,800
people awesome so I don't have to talk

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,980
about it too much so we just you know

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,600
use some some custom module and just

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,580
anytime we want to deploy something we

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,440
write a new hook update then push it

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,260
pull it and but it's time consuming and

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,640
well we don't have too much time right

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,870
another thing we invented was features

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:34,290
and who uses features here okay who

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:38,520
doesn't delicious okay features are

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,040
awesome so they helped a lot now we are

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,000
able to

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,520
to visually pack stuff together and just

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,830
create modules out of it and just add it

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,300
to get and we know who did it whoo if

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,700
somebody breaks something we know

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,170
precisely who broke something so it's

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:58,000
it's good however it's not so good due

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,820
to limitations of Drupal core and

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,740
overall use around friendliness we have

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,220
we have problem with auto increment

00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,070
indexes in Drupal 7 to be precise for

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,510
example using blocks and putting blocks

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,000
into features you cannot do that without

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:17,110
features extra and features extra is

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,440
something is like hell I hate it who

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:25,980
hates features extra okay so yeah that

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,800
that doesn't work really and you know

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:33,160
come on recreate revert what's that I

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,410
mean I had a lot of problems trying to

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,220
explain what is recreated what is revert

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,420
to two people who are well who are good

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,640
developers they're not really from

00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:49,240
Drupal world I that's that's crazy and

00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,950
finally this is a big problem when you

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,400
disable a feature it is going to delete

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:57,690
every settings setting in inside that's

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,090
well deployed using that feature so you

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,730
can use lose a lot of content but by

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,250
disabling feature and finally there is a

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,020
big problem if people are using features

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,960
for something but then overriding

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,610
features in life they end up with the

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,100
screen and this is this is a nightmare

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,990
this is a nightmare and you know when

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,520
you start working on a new project and

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,320
you see something like this and you're

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,900
not really sure where to start what to

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,820
do so first thing you can do is like

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,830
create create the group group called to

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,120
delete me and all the things that you

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,030
don't need to just put it there because

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,590
you must not uninstall it or even worse

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,229
you cannot uninstall it because it is

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:42,460
like circular dependent from something

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:44,740
other so it's a mess and and that man's

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,350
happens like this so if you have thing

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,320
called well you created an article an

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,110
article has node containing body and

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,649
which is a field base and feel

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,750
instance and then you created another

00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:01,459
content type called listing which is

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:06,899
actually also having body as as well

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:09,750
filled and filled instance so listing is

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:13,470
dependent on article no just imagine you

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,570
want to create a list of listings in the

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,010
article because client wanted that so

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,610
you're going to have entity relationship

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:24,329
ends at two listing notes and then you

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,950
have circular dependency and this is a

00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:29,760
nightmare to disable because well you

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:33,209
cannot disable it well not without too

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,790
much trouble in so we created again some

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:38,430
best practices and one of the practices

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,700
is we can force our features not to be

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:44,940
dependent one on another by by for

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,970
example creating unique fields for every

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,350
single note or content type and that

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,320
works but it results with a lot of

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:57,449
tables and it's also a master to

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,980
maintain who uses this approach not so

00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:01,290
many people okay so we have another

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:05,310
approach another approach is a little

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:07,800
bit better or Larry so we're going to do

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,410
the opposite we're going to create

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,279
feature for every single field we have

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:16,290
and then we can create dependencies well

00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,360
for every single note which also has a

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,430
feature and then we resolved with you

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,949
know we have a lot of features but but

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,140
everything is you need directionally

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:27,300
dependent of each other so we can create

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,100
views and those views will be dependent

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,720
on nodes and also we're going to be

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,930
dependent on the fields and everything

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,810
is going to work okay ish but we are

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:42,420
going to end up with a million of future

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:46,380
modules who does this ok so it's it

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,529
solves our problems but do you have to

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,680
think about this because now we have

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:54,810
configuration management or short cmi I

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,519
don't know who invented cmis

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,430
configuration management it's like

00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,709
occurring from initiative but still we

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,160
still use cmi and I use it as well even

00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,160
if it's wrong

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,390
so cmi allows you to do the stuff in the

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,760
database x por ti amo files and then

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,160
just add those llamo files in get at

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,709
those ya know files well push them and

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:25,019
then import them who uses cmi already

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:26,550
wow awesome so and of course we have

00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,410
drush and drug helps us a lot with

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,940
config export and config import and

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,970
finally we don't have problem with

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:38,630
revert features and whatever so it's

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:42,209
awesome it's great but let's talk about

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,610
practices what is good practice here or

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:48,360
bad practice I for example do not like

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,450
the location of exported files which is

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,980
well in file folder again this is

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,640
totally logical because that's the only

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,410
folder folder that is supposed to be

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:03,870
writable by by a purchaser or so it's

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:06,390
it's okay but this is in some

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,310
development environment I want this to

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,220
be somewhere where get and can pick up

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:14,579
those file and fussing just manipulate

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:18,240
vida so there's a fix to protect of

00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:22,470
course in settings PHP config the rector

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:26,070
is erasing item just can be changed to

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,140
something anything and after Josh config

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,270
expert everything is going to be working

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,000
perfectly so we end up with a lot of

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,140
files and Drupal took care of security

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,130
so it added htaccess which is awesome

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:44,329
and now we can see hundreds of file

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,800
hundreds of files with various settings

00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:50,240
those hundreds files can easily become

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,270
one thousand files in in complicated

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,670
projects which could be a problem so my

00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,449
initial idea when I saw it is this bunch

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:03,480
of file is passes can I create a lot of

00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:06,630
directories and just categorize those

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,230
files so that i can use them afterwards

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:12,690
no I cannot of course it won't work so

00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:15,870
if we want to categorize all those

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,540
features we are going to use features

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,300
module again

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:25,240
but it got seriously updated and totally

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:27,589
rewritten and now it is built on top of

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,139
config management which is awesome

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:32,600
because now we are not using feature

00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:35,060
features to deploy any configuration or

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,019
anything so that's that's all by drupal

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:41,120
we are only bundling configuration into

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,569
various mongoose here or various well

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,579
modules now due to the fact that modules

00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:48,860
are being shipped with their own sets of

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:53,360
config and that's the feature features

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:56,600
are ya using massively and that config

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,380
is being imported into active

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,589
configuration of Drupal on install

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,440
Drupal cannot really detect the changes

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:08,930
on already installed modules so features

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,610
are taking care of that of course

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,850
features are exporting and importing

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,319
changes they are auto patch packaging

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,370
which is the same they did before so

00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:21,199
it's like normal and they're doing name

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,980
spacing and namespaces you is really

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,190
awesome so it solves the big problem of

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,720
creating a feature which already has a

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,690
module with similar name on drupal.org

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:38,360
and then then who had that problem with

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:42,680
its name collisions of cartridge modules

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,660
and features anyone yeah so you create a

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,810
feature called blog and you're in

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:50,660
problem because yeah so namespacing

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,880
solves that and of course the best thing

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,649
with features is its a def module you're

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,649
going to enable it only in development

00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:00,100
environment you don't need it on live

00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:03,350
server or on production environment

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:07,189
however you still have problem with

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,380
dependencies and if you're going to use

00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:11,959
features for your your stuff you still

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,139
have to use the same techniques you used

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:19,519
before in order to manage well

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:22,130
dependencies nevertheless good thing is

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,750
if you disable a feature you're not

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,670
going to lose your content because all

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,079
the all the settings you created are

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,550
going to remain that and that's that's

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,209
huge advantage that that's something

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:35,300
unbelievable so

00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:37,700
as a conclusion features should be only

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,440
used to bundle configuration you don't

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,730
have to use it for for deployment and

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,410
that's that's awesome and okay so you

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,630
managed to deploy your site and you

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,230
started working in it and there's this

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:53,540
huge problem with you know people site

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,750
builders like to do these tiny little

00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,740
changes in live environments without you

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:04,070
know moving stuff back to to local and

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,019
you know that's that's bad thing and we

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,209
do that so how to how to save ourselves

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:09,380
when you have discrepancy between your

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,760
local environments in your live

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,100
environments and you want to keep

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,529
changes in live environments well the

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,250
face thing you can do is of course to

00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:21,410
export settings in live environment

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,959
added to get pushed into depository and

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,630
pull them back in in your locals that

00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:28,610
works sometimes you have a problem where

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:32,149
you want to keep both changes in local

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:34,550
and remote environment and for that

00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:37,010
there is a thing called Josh config

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,990
merge now I first heard about it six

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,720
months ago and I still haven't tried it

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,990
but I read a lot of aroused it and it

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,630
uses get to to merge local changes and

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:52,040
remote changes keep em all does anybody

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:53,360
know anything about this no you should

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,190
try it I should try it somebody should

00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,560
try it and talk about it and well this

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,360
is my favorites you know just forbid

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,910
complete changes in live and that's

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,290
there's a module for that called

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:11,120
configuration read-only mode just you

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:13,850
know forbid it goodbye problem salt now

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,110
our installation profiles that there's

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:19,579
this thing we invented in Drupal 7 to

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,829
create installation profile during our

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,079
web development process and then just

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,910
all the modules so the config all the

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,679
stuff we create just just to put an

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,600
installation profile so once we are done

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,570
once we want to deploy the site we are

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,130
going just too well push everything and

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,290
install using that installation problem

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:41,210
my profile and we're done who uses this

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:43,700
strategy here installation profiles not

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,510
what people okay so it's an interesting

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,760
strategy

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,190
it's it's awesome it's easy to test and

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,140
maintain and everything's good but do we

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,660
really need them due to the fact that we

00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,300
could possibly do something like this we

00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:01,490
could build a site in our local

00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:03,380
environment export files push them do

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,160
minimal installation and then import

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:15,320
config did anybody try this how did it

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:17,300
end for me it ended like this so it

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,640
turned out config management to help

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,870
with continuous deployment but not with

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,580
with initial deployment due to the fact

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,920
that once you install the site you get

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,080
site uuid once you solve the site

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,750
another time you get another new ID and

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:39,380
that discrepancy just kills a kitten so

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:43,250
as a way around this you can just do

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,110
minimal installation deploy files push

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,820
the database just deploy the database

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,430
and then you're going to have the same

00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,150
you idea and then you're going to just

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,410
push file so or you can use installation

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,820
profiles and we're back at the

00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:59,810
installation profile same thing we used

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,340
in Drupal 7 so you can just create

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,470
installation profile and really

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,580
installation profiles in Drupal 8 are

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,590
not that different from from

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:13,160
installation profile in Drupal 7 so well

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,340
directory is the same info files became

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:22,040
info llaman files install files are the

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:24,680
same profile files same we are not

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,900
packing features well or configuration

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,510
to features directory there are not

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,190
modules anymore we can just add all the

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:35,960
configuration to convenience tall and

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:40,190
modules are in the same place things are

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,920
the same place when you look at input

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,330
files and info llamo files it is really

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,640
difficult to find the difference even

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:52,690
though it's different syntax so same and

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,850
the only interesting thing is okay this

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,220
setting files or yama files that are

00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,770
being placed in some magical config

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,950
install folder and they just simply work

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,990
so 11 can really be attracted by this

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,400
and try to do something like okay I'm

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,309
going to build the entire website I'm

00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,070
going to export my settings into some

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:15,350
directory somewhere I'm going to copy

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,289
all the settings into insulation profile

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,650
and I'm going to well install a new site

00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:27,860
with those settings did anybody try that

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:31,990
did it work nope I hate it so it didn't

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:36,230
work and turned out again these files

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:41,059
were built to do continuous deployment

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,980
not not to the Duke installations so if

00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,870
you want to do installations either

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,730
you're going to cherry-pick llaman files

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,770
in order not to break the entire

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:55,039
installation or you're going to use

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:58,940
pictures so next Nobel practice in

00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:03,200
Drupal 7 world is josh and suck does

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:09,820
anybody know what and zach is so drupal

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:12,909
by default sucks drupal 7 that is so and

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,679
nobody is no really I guess I hope

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:18,169
toolbar is a little bit you know useless

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,750
and you want to disable those you want

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:23,179
to enable admin menu we want to enable

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,820
module filter jquery update I mean

00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:28,730
jquery 1.4 that's that's ancient and of

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,799
course drupal websites without see tools

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:36,650
use libraries they're not really useful

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:39,679
so you want to do all that but in Drupal

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,809
7 Drupal 8 you already have all of this

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,270
so the only thing I could find as my

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:46,370
standard unlock practices just enable

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:49,669
admin toolbar tober which allows me to

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,390
have this wonderful drop down so give

00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:55,669
them a try if you haven't already which

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,520
ends up with with all the old practices

00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:01,970
and they're kind of the same now we have

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:05,200
a new practice totally new practice in

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:10,309
Drupal 8 which is like drupal 7 as well

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,370
so we have composer and composer is de

00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:15,320
facto standard for

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:19,660
well all the modern PHP applications

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:23,060
today it handles dependencies it have

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,940
provides you with autoloader it keeps

00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:29,300
the codes updated with composer update

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,510
and it feels really good to use it it's

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:35,390
a shell thing and it's really good so

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,280
but the question is is it Drupal

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,650
friendly is ready to be used in

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,990
production environment so let's start

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:46,130
with basic stuff so setting up a project

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:48,050
so with Josh you just use josh dl drop

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,370
duple and then install it let composer

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,630
syntax is a little bit different but

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:56,300
nothing nothing too complicated so

00:22:52,630 --> 00:23:01,100
sounds okay for now there is this

00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:03,200
problem off of performance it turns out

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:09,050
josh is ten times faster than then

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:12,200
composer so composer with warm caches

00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:16,520
totally full everything up to date needs

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,690
31 seconds to to deploy it well working

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,700
core and well josh needs only 12 seconds

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,310
things can get really nasty wit with

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,050
cold cash is for composer then it's more

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:35,420
than two minutes so performance wise

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:37,760
it's not so good and you need to set up

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,060
composer you need to prepare your your

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,360
the entire environmental everything to

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:46,520
to use it so first thing you need to do

00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,400
is you need to use drupal org repository

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,760
and there's a command for that then you

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,150
need to make sure that all the stuff you

00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:00,230
download are going to be in Drupal

00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:03,440
director is not in / vendor so you're

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,810
going to have to install this library

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,400
custom installer and then add some

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:12,710
settings into into composer to JSON file

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,660
which is not a big problem and then of

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:18,730
course if you're going to allow composer

00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:21,770
to to manage all your country of stuff

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,520
you have to make sure that you know

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,480
getting no

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,700
all the contribs duff but then you're in

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,560
problem with with patches you know if

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,100
get ignores and okay I'm going to talk

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,810
about it later so once you're done you

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,020
can get a module relatively easy

00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,940
composer require I believe this is an

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,510
error it should be Drupal / admin

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,820
toolbar so yeah but otherwise and it's

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,710
it's okay once once you're done with it

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,780
just enable the module and it's going to

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:56,030
break okay developers might like only to

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,980
avoid this composer thing and just Josh

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:01,400
enable and it is going to download and

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:05,350
install so it is not really good well

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:09,350
the best performance thing ever and I

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:11,660
said patching so you're pulling a module

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,150
you need to apply patch if that / module

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,980
is not going to be part of your get then

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:19,160
you need to apply that patches / in

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:22,280
production as well so there is a way to

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,980
set up composer to apply patches but it

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,720
is not by default supported so what you

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,100
need to do you need to add this library

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:36,740
composer patches and you need to dine in

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:42,380
this patches file add well connect

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:47,210
patches to to patch files too well

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:51,260
modules installed it's a lot of setup so

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:56,870
somebody was Martin gave us come Drupal

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:58,780
composer which is a well starting point

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:02,090
for you to bootstrap all your composure

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:05,020
projects it already supports patching

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:08,300
it's already supports custom directories

00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:10,040
scaffolding it has a good people to get

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,260
ignore and all the all the goodies you

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:18,410
really need so just just touch me with

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:22,100
it and it is going to work so with all

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:26,780
of these things built in if you are

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,330
using Dragic workflow composer can

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,250
really help you and replace us make

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:36,160
virtual in a way that is going to be

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:36,160
readable to other PHP developers

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:44,270
however there's this big question can i

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,610
sell this to my boss so i probably can

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,080
sell composer to your developers but you

00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,230
know managers are a little bit different

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,780
so they're going to ask me about return

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:58,100
of investment they're going to you know

00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:01,490
ask me about okay so 100 0 100 and 31

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:08,900
seconds against 12 seconds that's kind

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:11,360
of bad so I still have not the entire

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,760
answer I know that with composer you can

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,190
save a lot of time with on deployment so

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,420
program it for example platform SH

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:23,060
already included this entire composer

00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,730
built into their workflow so once you

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,980
push all the changes well in composer

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,780
file and only in composer file it is

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,700
going to install all the required

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,530
modules it is going to install all the

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,650
dependencies for you it is going to

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:39,650
apply patches for you so it is going to

00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:43,760
be well it is going to do a lot of

00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:47,380
wonderful stuff for you and I hope this

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,390
process can well save enough time or

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:57,110
provide that return of investment your

00:27:50,390 --> 00:28:03,440
managers require hopefully and to

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:06,140
conclude i started this session as well

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,380
story about best practices but question

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,230
is do they exist and i don't really

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,520
think they're you exist so i would

00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,250
really like to call them current

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,200
practices and why current practices

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,200
because they always need to be questions

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,290
they always need to be refined so when

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,760
you have some idea it should be

00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:31,220
documented it should be time-tested

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,930
rethought again it should be shared with

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:38,300
other people again refined with them so

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,940
other people should question and refine

00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,900
those ideas and it is a circular process

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:48,140
which returns back to to another

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,030
questioning of practices and hopefully

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,150
that

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:57,120
we'll provide us better better software

00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:57,120
and better working paradigms thank

00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:25,830
questions yeah I can I can repeat it

00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,799
repeat so the question was if you're

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:31,769
using composer how can you add your

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,200
custom modules to do it basically you

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:36,899
don't you don't you you just push it in

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,460
get and continue with that unless unless

00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:41,700
you're happy to share it with other

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,099
people and then then there is a process

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,299
for that of course which includes web

00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:47,299
publishing it to drupal org

00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:00,160
I doesn't work

00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:18,480
oh I can composer does it work for

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,890
multi-site composer I have no idea it

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,419
should be working I mean why not but

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,539
because it composer only handled files

00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:29,549
and dependencies so and they are shared

00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:36,659
between multi sites so I don't see the

00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:41,909
reason why not yes I just wanted to

00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:43,980
mention my answer the question is we're

00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:45,870
currently architecting it so that we

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,490
have a psych repo that hasn't modules in

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:50,429
the themes directory when the composer

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:52,409
JSON and so that what we do is run a

00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,539
postscript after you do your composure

00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:57,649
built that symlinks those folders where

00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,649
they need to go for drupal

00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,600
I'm not going to repeat that it's too

00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:14,400
much but if you want to use the

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:19,350
microphone or but yeah anybody else yes

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,350
Abbe ladies first

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:36,490
i believe last change was really good

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:40,580
and it was in September 23rd a 20-second

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:43,760
on drupal org so and it's really full of

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,070
new stuff and it's good but i suggest

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:51,020
you to take a look at this oh wait a

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:55,250
minute ok so this Drupal composer thing

00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:57,890
or a platform SH example Drupal 8

00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,810
because it's basically everything you

00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,810
need to know about composer it just

00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:06,170
squeezed in and with it you're just we

00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:13,480
just clone this and we're ready to go no

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:13,480
problem app yep any questions

00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,280
okay so the question was what's the best

00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,100
way to handle situations where you have

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,470
multiple environments and you want

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:04,190
various configuration to be in various

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:07,740
well environment so I have no idea I

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,930
guess well that's that's really

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,060
interesting question i guess you'd have

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,830
to use features and just this area

00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,860
decide where to enable those features in

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,960
rent in which environments so i guess

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:22,440
but it's it's a good good thing to do

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,590
you know to think about in terms of how

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:33,950
to create this best practice for that or

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:37,530
recommended practice for that yep yeah I

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:41,760
can't read my own sweat with a logical

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:45,030
question about Dave and if you want to

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:49,740
not to reply devil for example there is

00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:54,240
a dress Jewish cx2 expert but you can

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,860
use skip modules and you can give names

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,970
of modules that we don't want to export

00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:03,300
so that it's not in your get you don't

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:05,570
have the problem with config that you

00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,370
don't want to have in production and

00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:11,520
another problem is with something that

00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:16,889
you want to be different in production

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,899
or in dev and you can use I don't

00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:22,710
remember exactly but you can write it in

00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:25,470
fights some like you can override the

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:28,080
config that is in database with config

00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:31,649
that is in facts like in settings and

00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,909
things like this so that even if in your

00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:39,120
form you know coughing form you see like

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:42,419
CSS is a CSS packaging a compressing is

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,610
on actually it's not on a new dev

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:45,419
because this config that you see in the

00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:51,240
form it's

00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:54,990
written by a file that's it but as I was

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,839
a little problem with Jewish cex skip

00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:00,540
modules because it skips the models but

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,299
not always the config that depend on

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:08,910
that matters and I'm currently working

00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:10,799
on a patch of Josh to do this and I'm

00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:14,490
not on the only one but it's still a

00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:19,470
little problem yeah thank you well it's

00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:23,220
I I'm only thinking about how to

00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:25,619
automate all this so that's kind of next

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,109
question if okay so you need still need

00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,880
manual power power human power to decide

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:31,799
what is going to which environment but

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:38,339
it will be interesting to think about

00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:44,210
how to automate the process other

00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:44,210
questions comments rotten tomatoes

00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,680
so the question was if I heard correctly

00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,870
isn't it possible to just disable

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:12,480
modules with with some settings in

00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:15,840
various environments oh that actually

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:20,250
could work but then you cannot really

00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,440
you cannot really hmm so I think like to

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,530
have various settings local settings in

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:32,270
various that that could actually be

00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:39,920
interesting to try I have no idea yeah

00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:39,920
