Title: DrupalCon Dublin 2016: Bridging Communities
Publication date: 2016-09-27
Playlist: DrupalCon Dublin 2016
Description: 
	The Drupal ecosystem has lead the way in bridging communities. The project itself is now built on many technologies, libraries, and even more experiences. But has enough been done?


This talk will review the bridges our communities have. It will also look at some practical suggestions and solutions on how to look outside our comfort zones, widen our technical circles, and ensure that we learn from other people's mistakes whilst bridging the gap between communities. As a result, we can make our communities stronger and more diverse.

hi everyone thank you for going to this

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,120
intimate lovely natal group I love it

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,179
when we have a small group my name is

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,839
Jenny and I'm from a company called

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,830
humor made we are a company that does

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,930
WordPress at scale so I was here

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,230
yesterday and a lot of people were

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,930
asking why are you here like you do

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,859
WordPress you had a drupalcon which is

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,660
to be for a very very good question and

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,719
the answer to that question that I

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,649
figured out yesterday is because the

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,680
organizers pick this talk so that is the

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,570
reason why but more importantly is a

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,390
talk that I'm very passionate about the

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:53,789
a variety of reasons which I will share

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,469
with you today I was a electronic

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,180
engineer student and then I was an art

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,719
student and then I was doing this and

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,600
that and I finally found a degree that I

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,369
actually liked called multi media and

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,020
Internet technology and it's part of

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,890
that course I had to take an internship

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,420
which I did I took that internship at a

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,680
place which was a PHP house and one of

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,990
the things that they do there is they

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,960
are the co-founders of PHP Northwest

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:30,540
it's a PHP conference in the northwest

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,159
of the UK in Manchester and they one of

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,670
the jobs i had was to maintain this site

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,520
which is on wordpress in my year at that

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,049
company i was doing sem framework re

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:47,280
skins wordpress stuff true pal stuff it

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,659
was drupal 6 so it was painful and but

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
it was it was all good firm because as a

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,509
student you learn lots of new things and

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,430
you try different things and you try and

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,619
things at the same time and it was all

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,060
very exciting to me for one I didn't

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,979
realize there was an industry that paid

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,259
you to make websites which is something

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,500
I've been doing since I was 13 so I

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,180
easily taken eight years to realize a

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,160
get paid for something I was doing like

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,390
of my own back which was kind of not

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,360
fair

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,970
but it's all good and dandy and he's

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,290
really cool going to this I like as part

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,610
of my intern I got to go to this

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,200
conference and it was really cool

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,810
because I got to meet all the speakers

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,440
on the attendees and I get and going

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,850
around going I'm a sueded like what

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,770
advice can you give me what advice would

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,260
you give your student self and people

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,450
were telling me things and all this

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,290
stuff and it was really inspiring super

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:40,709
super inspiring and so inspiring that

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,660
when I left the company I went back and

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:50,190
I finish off my degree it was a good

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:53,489
past yes and then the funny thing though

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,260
I was like I gotta assign to build the

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,300
next version of the pitch window first

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,739
website which is 2011 and it was first

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,660
time I ever built a website for

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,430
developers and there's nothing like

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,930
building a website especially like a

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,090
conference I twitch is all PHP

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,970
developers where they will like

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,950
scrutinize every pixel that's in the one

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,600
place and how like the CSS animations

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,489
didn't work properly or like i just

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,500
missed the bug in like this particular

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,090
browser because i totally forgot to test

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,030
it on safari because i was on a linux

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,269
machine and it was a great learning

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:29,010
experience again having all these people

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,930
tell you that your project was amazing

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,380
but also that you got all these little

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,950
things wrong was really cool it meant

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:42,750
that I was like being like Co community

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:46,650
mentored by all these people in 2012

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,750
when I graduated I was actually looking

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,260
for a job as it as you do when you

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,549
graduate and I actually applied for a

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,040
company that was doing to repel and a

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,620
company that was doing WordPress and I

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,989
had to pick between the two um because I

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,230
but got the both the job offers and I'm

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,150
going with WordPress and in 2012 I also

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,370
ended up going to my first word camp so

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,790
it's the first like CMS centric and

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,579
Sioux community event in Edinburgh and

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,829
again it was a community that was lovely

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,799
and really welcoming to this just

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,690
graduate person who had like gone into a

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,920
project was far too big over her head

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,710
and was a soul

00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,270
developer on it bro is fine I got to go

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,520
there and meet someone who had met on

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,230
the internet who was helping me fix the

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,480
things that were an issue at work on a

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,250
four room and to be able to stand in for

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,130
that person and say thank you was

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,810
amazing like just to realize that the

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,490
person who's been typing on the internet

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,890
was actually a real human it was kind of

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:49,800
nice and it is kind of proceeded in 2013

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,620
until 2013 when my partner got a job

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,180
down south so we commuted all the way

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,180
from Manchester dental reading which is

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,330
a really cool place right by London but

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,880
running even though nicknamed sometimes

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,320
the silicon valley of the UK doesn't

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,330
have many user groups it doesn't have a

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,440
PHP it didn't have a PHP user group he

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,700
didn't have a wordpress user group it

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,570
doesn't have a Drupal user group even

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,090
though acquia are based there hint and

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,610
they the day they had one witches

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,110
reading geeks night and another one

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,150
which is and breaking borders which was

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,770
more for like front and design eerie

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,930
thing so it wasn't really aimed at me

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,000
and then there was like sit up stuff

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,150
there's like this whole bit in the

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,700
middle that was just missing and the one

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,160
thing I learned over this time is that

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,420
I'm a community addict I love meeting

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,210
new people in the community I love

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,460
learning from people I love just hanging

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,660
out with people and hearing their

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,510
stories of how they got to where they

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,190
are and the journeys and the trials and

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,830
tribulations that they've had in that on

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,890
their way because every one of us has a

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,060
different journey and it's something

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,830
that I've become really passionate about

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,480
because I really appreciate the fact

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,190
that the PHP northwest community was

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,330
there for me when I started that they

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:06,240
were welcoming in 2014 it was my last

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,610
year of running PHP Northwest as an

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,740
organizer because we've done self it's

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,140
kind of annoying to travel back and

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,410
forth for a conference and organizing

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:21,630
and stuff and so it was my last year it

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,790
was really really sad and it was the

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:29,850
first time at a PHP conference where I

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:32,450
had found that people were laughing at

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,680
the word WordPress and it wasn't nice

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,260
before that I had noticed that a lot of

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,940
WordPress people that I met didn't

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,940
go to PHP conferences and because it was

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,500
my last PHP conference as a organizer I

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,540
gave them my word that this was the

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,810
nicest PHP community that will ever meet

00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,030
and I would guarantee them that they

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,830
would have a good time and then for

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,310
those people to turn up to my conference

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,340
and then listen to Aquino who mentions

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,290
the word WordPress in a completely

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,980
acceptable manner and then the Han tire

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:06,680
room laughing laughing with the joke or

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,550
laughing at the joke doesn't matter they

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,520
were laughing I actually tweeted this

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:17,210
out straightaway I was heartbroken I was

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,150
not even heartbroken really I was fuming

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,780
and people who were at that conference

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,210
know how fuming I was because at the end

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,340
of the conference the other organizers

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,680
got me on stage gave me a microphone

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,600
which is such a bad idea and then and

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,740
said okay keep making free words I was

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,070
like are you sure you want to run after

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,400
today's like Stephanie yeah so off I

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,710
went and this is actually where this

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,950
talk comes from because I realized at

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,040
that moment that is a real problem with

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,890
the way that in our silo communities

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,540
were behaving I amongst each other and

00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,860
it's really unfair because like I'm

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,450
trying my hardest to bring all the

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,210
people in and then you're just making me

00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,310
really upset and it just makes me really

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:06,170
sad I'm more like that person on that

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:09,320
and so as part of some research I was

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,830
doing I'm not very scientific I just

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,720
tweeted out this tweet doing a very non

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,030
scientific research how do you as the

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,150
non WordPress community perceive the

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:23,090
WordPress community and I got some good

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,920
responses from the glimpse I get through

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,110
the feet are very large vibrant active

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,630
passionate group of people or very

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,440
positive words fantastic then you get

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:38,270
stuff like this or not good enough to be

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,150
a real developer hmm it's a pretty sad

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,430
response just as someone pointed out and

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:48,410
it's even a small set of response when I

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,910
go to the biggest workout in the like

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,160
WordPress calendar

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,850
at the time in 2014 which is work up San

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,750
Francisco I speak to one of the core

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:04,100
developers of WordPress and ask them to

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,260
submit a paper a coffer paper to a PHP

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,170
conference in the UK and the response

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:13,130
was I'm too scared to go they will mock

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:15,830
me for being a wordpress developer this

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,140
is a core developer who stands onstage

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:22,550
at WordPress event and talks about

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,380
darker PHP 7 and HH p.m. and says this

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,510
is like a really cool way to build your

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,730
service and you know tells all the

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,890
latest stuff yet they are not willing to

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,210
do the same talk a PHP conference

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:36,020
because they're scared of being marked

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:39,590
there is a problem their boss that faces

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,580
the market of WordPress by any other

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,190
communities like watching my parents

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,190
have a fight every day I my parents used

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,140
to fight a lot and it's not a nice place

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,360
to be as a child you don't want your

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,290
parents fighting as a child of the open

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,560
source community because that's why I

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,630
really feel like I am you know I I grew

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,100
as a developer being in the open source

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,560
community the open source community has

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,390
given me my ability to be a developer

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,250
every time I've had a problem even when

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,250
I was at University doing my

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,050
dissertation I was doing my project and

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,530
a hat I didn't know how to do something

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,360
so I asks the community on IRC and so on

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:17,740
sent me a library and I was like great

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,820
i'll just attribute it to you thanks

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,240
having all these people who I consider

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,650
my parents fighting is really really bad

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,420
now I was here yesterday at the

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,010
community summit and I met a bunch of

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,500
people who said actually like drupal get

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,360
this is a lot to which also makes me

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,750
really upset because the reality of it

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,490
is the marking of any technology by

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,500
anyone is like watching my parents i'll

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,780
fight every day I don't want to see why

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,480
we have to mock each other or fight

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:48,020
about which one's better the fight is

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,200
not with open source projects it should

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:54,680
be against proprietary software why are

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,430
we fighting amongst ourselves I don't

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:01,240
care if you're doing true power typo3

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,010
joomla magento WordPress you

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,459
an open source and that's amazing you're

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:09,430
sharing the information you know but

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,350
when we are mocking ourselves amongst

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:16,660
each other proprietary software just

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,370
getting off easy software does what we

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,250
tell it to do or what we teach it to do

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,459
with today's AAA the thing that are

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,899
fighting our people now it was really

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:28,390
cool today because I was in the pre know

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:30,880
if you missed the Pinot totally watch it

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,120
cuz it was really funny and they use an

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,860
ode Irish proverb I can't pronounce that

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,020
but it says two people short on the road

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,910
that's what means and the idea is that

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,600
if you work together you can get further

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:47,260
and its really really true people make

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:51,610
the community you are the community so

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,560
the onus is on you on me on all of us to

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,160
make a community that we're proud of an

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,720
open source community the Drupal

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,190
community has great initiatives that

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,140
have already been in place for a while

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,050
the getting of the island thing was

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,910
amazing they go PHP fighting back in the

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,410
day was also really cool that started

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,510
the Drupal community the fact that

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,250
you've taken on Symphony framework

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,750
components and you having these

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,870
discussions in Auckland is really really

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:20,920
inspiring to other communities but there

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,450
is more to be done there is no silver

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,610
bullet I will just give you that for

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,670
free but I do believe that

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,790
multi-dimensional problems which this is

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:34,990
needs a multi-dimensional solution so

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:37,300
I've come up with some suggestions and I

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,560
would love to hear if anyone else has

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,470
other suggestions or other things that

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,110
they're doing to try and bridge these

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,459
communities and when I talk about

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,750
bridging communities I'm not saying that

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,190
you have to go and live in these other

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,890
communities I'm just saying like go and

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,110
visit them every so often so first and

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,300
foremost events I mentioned PHP

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,000
Northwest but please be Northwest the

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,850
conference also has a user group also

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,350
named PHP know for us and it's really

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:07,750
cool because I met the this one this one

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,240
and this one and there are three pillars

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:14,430
I met these three people of PHP

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,649
Northwest Philip Mike an Eli and

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,610
and then this guy here was the guy who

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:22,560
interviewed me for the job at the Drupal

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,480
company that a nearly took and these

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,550
sole reason I nearly took that job was

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,430
because I really liked him as an

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,380
interviewer sole reason I would nearly

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,670
took that job so my life could be very

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,290
very different in a different open

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,940
source community and it's really cool

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,610
glad I met these people these true

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,050
colors at a PHP event because that was

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,910
my gateway into the Drupal community

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,920
when I've seen those true power 6

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,110
projects they were the people I a so I

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,240
was like how you Philip your Drupal how

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,020
do you do this it's great to have those

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,130
connections user groups or if you're the

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,510
WordPress community see we call them

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:59,670
meet us because yeah we're special and

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,740
the great places to meet each other our

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,850
monthly basis in your local area and

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,190
there's loads of them in both

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,560
communities all over the world there's

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,690
also Drupal cams in your local area but

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,660
there's also word camps as well nearly

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,640
most open source projects have something

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,279
similar in that in many regions of the

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,980
world so definitely check it out there's

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,560
also conferences like this but I think

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,020
from what I've learnt yesterday was

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,080
community summits inviting other people

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,060
other members from other projects into

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,430
your community summit it's a great way

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,170
to share oh how do you do this what's

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,089
your solution to that because that was

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,709
what yesterday was filled with it was

00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,880
for me really interesting to see how

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:42,870
Drupal ecosystem is set up but also

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,640
equally interesting to see what

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,800
questions people had about WordPress and

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,570
be able to share my experiences in the

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,400
WordPress community now I know that

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,260
going to a workout is probably not to be

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,670
interesting to go to the tours but you

00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,160
might want to like meet the people and

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,860
see the community firsthand so why don't

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,050
you volunteer I would love to do more

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,190
volunteering in other projects and it's

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,320
one thing that I've decided that I'm

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,240
going to do more of because yesterday

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,470
when I came here I started taking

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,120
pictures and I wanted to know how

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,589
organizers were doing so if I'm running

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,720
their communities well if you're a

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:19,380
volunteer you get to see that firsthand

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,089
you're part of that team so if you want

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,480
to be interested in bridging those

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:27,360
communities in a people manner than

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,060
volunteer or the event that opens

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,649
if you work in mean Toledo you should

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,329
also be looking at Community Leadership

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:37,529
Summit the next one is happening in

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,700
London in about a month's time there's

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:42,209
other things that you can do as well

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,279
documentation I noticed it's kind of

00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,779
hard to combine a lot of people

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,820
mentioned yesterday that there was not

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,430
many much documentation for drupal camps

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,350
and drew power meters but WordPress has

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,089
actually done a lot of work on our

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,940
workout documentation this thing is

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,980
crazy long and pretty much a book on how

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,870
to run a boy camp and all you need to do

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,640
is replace the word workout and

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,800
WordPress with the word drupalcamp and

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,269
Drupal and you're probably going to get

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,070
lots and lots of great resources there

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:09,480
so if you're looking for resources ask

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,350
all the communities what resources they

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,180
have and learn from them now with dates

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,670
of our events it'd be really cool if we

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,190
could consider add well what when we set

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,019
our dates there's a project which is

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,329
open source and it's run by one person

00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,370
really and could open Tek calendar and

00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:29,060
it's a really great concept but it isn't

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,440
get much traction for various reasons

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,880
but even without this open source

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,160
project you shouldn't know your local

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,329
community members and ask them have you

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,310
got an event coming up but you're

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,050
planning could we share dates so that we

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,910
don't clash or let's put them a weekend

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,010
after each other so people can fly in

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,820
for both know things like that make a

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:49,860
great idea joint events as well winning

00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,990
a joint event with a local user group is

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,029
really cool true repel Austria did this

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,250
last year where the security team

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,620
members from WordPress type of food and

00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,730
Drupal had been talking to each other

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,350
about the work and it was really

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,000
interesting to have all those people

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,740
with all their expertise come together

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,640
in one location and it was a huge

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,470
success PHP ug is a great place to find

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,910
your local PHP user groups and you are a

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,130
PHP CMS the same way WordPress is so go

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,890
and have a look at what your nose PHP

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,839
user group is there's also something

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,069
that we did once really cool e in

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,600
Manchester which is open sprint days i

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,340
was talking to make and he mentioned how

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,960
the drupal open Sprint's always had the

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,240
same people and i was complaining how

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,780
the web press contributed a's which is

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,100
our word for Sprint's basically it was

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,080
full of newbies and we'd really like to

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,120
have more people like you are like more

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,350
mature and like

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,750
being in the project a bit longer and

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,430
we'll debate in how these run so we got

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,180
together and just went let's just open

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,880
it open source sprint project and sprint

00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,040
day so we invited anyone who had an open

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,510
source project to come along we one of

00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,820
us got the food the other one got the

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,850
venue that's all you really need for

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:05,150
sprint tables chairs internet you get to

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,590
go and even the gym our community got

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,900
involved and it was really really cool

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,580
because when you're on your own and

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,380
doing a sprint with just your team

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,910
there's only a certain amount of you

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,220
there which means that the buzz in the

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,350
room is a very high there wasn't that

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,390
like clacking and like the talking and

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,370
lovely all of it the energy that comes

00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,780
from a large group of people but when

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,300
you had all these different open source

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,920
projects come together there was an

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,510
energy we were working on completely

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,460
different tables completely different

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,990
projects yet their energy was feeding

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,200
into our energy and it was such an

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,580
inspiration what I mean talking to

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,990
Robert who's part of the droop our

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,750
London group and we're talking about

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,450
doing these quarterly again but it would

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,070
be really cool if other places in walk

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,440
across the world would do it too because

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,720
I think it's something that would really

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:56,300
really help to bridge the community gap

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,980
a little bit more also open camps I went

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,390
to the first open camp in the UN and

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:04,550
back in July and it was basically just

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,960
full of all these open source projects

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,820
it's kind of like fuzz them in the

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,170
Europe if you've not been too fast them

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,170
as another one that you should really go

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,780
to really good fun but these these

00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:17,210
events which have multiple different

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,620
open source projects coming together is

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,340
something that we all should be like

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:24,500
working towards for one it saves venue

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,690
higher costs so I'm all game for that

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,640
because that's a lot of pain and when

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,260
you in doubt about doing a joint event

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,059
then during the summer have a barbecue

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,860
barbecues are a great way to bring

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:39,230
people together in a really relaxed

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,059
manner everyone's not having to say this

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,130
is better that is better and everyone's

00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:46,460
there to enjoy and most people i do

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,500
believe need to eat some food in some

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,900
manner so a barbecue is a great way to

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,270
host a group of different people and get

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,440
them to mingle together maybe do that

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,210
drupal bingo that you had

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,549
downstairs that was a great way find

00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:02,149
someone to do different things that'd be

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:05,000
a really fun way to have a barbecue if

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:07,549
you are courageous and I hope you are

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,830
then do a field trip go to their user

00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:11,870
groups and ask people how they solve

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,240
their problems both Drupal and WordPress

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,460
has accessibility issues we both have

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,350
translation issues I bet your broker

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,509
security issues and i bet you we both

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,340
have community issues it's really

00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:23,809
interesting to hear how other people are

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,730
doing it so we can say Oh would that

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,679
work for us but that not work for us and

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,750
discuss those things so we can learn

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,700
from each other it's also really cool

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,389
when you invite outside community people

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,700
to speak at your events like me hello

00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:39,590
but I would love to see more of this

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,879
both on a local level and on a larger

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:46,190
scale it brings in new perspectives and

00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:47,389
one thing for sure in the WordPress

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,580
community whenever I go somewhere else

00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:51,019
to speak they always say oh yeah I

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,789
should be more like that I should go to

00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:54,950
my local Drupal community because they

00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:57,529
realize that if i admonish come here and

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,090
then not be killed by leaving then it

00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:00,409
must have been a good time and I

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,409
definitely will be telling them I did

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:05,120
because I do believe that shown your

00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:08,059
knowledge and showing your solutions

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,750
means that everyone can submit to their

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:13,720
local community events I mean no one can

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,309
tell you that your information is wrong

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,460
when you do go to these other events

00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:21,049
bring back the knowledge you gain is one

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,519
thing just go to these events but it's

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:24,710
another thing to talk about these events

00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:28,429
that you're going to so one thing that i

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,740
do do when i go to another project event

00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,750
is then go back and talk about troop

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,460
alcala in the community summit i spent

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,110
two hours yesterday with the community

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,759
teen saying what the Drupal community

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,139
some it was like and how it all worked

00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,759
because it works differently to the way

00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:42,409
the WordPress one works and there were

00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,840
like oh it's really interesting two

00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:47,450
hours it was like 1am in the morning

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,600
with the Americans it was crazy and

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,500
another thing try building a side

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,600
project on another platform is one thing

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,039
to be looking and listening and hearing

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,460
about this stuff it's another thing to

00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,169
try it out I estoy Drupal a I love it

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,899
compared to Drupal 6 that was the last

00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,680
experience I had and so my perception of

00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:09,360
Drupal 6 adria Pauline general

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,360
all about you plus 6 but when I tried

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,750
eight I was like garlic this is where e

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,950
Bella I'm grateful that someone was

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,450
persistent on me try and repel eight

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,180
because otherwise my perception of drape

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,830
I would have been wrong he's really

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,370
important to compare and contrast what's

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,840
going on today as well as previously and

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:30,690
making sure that our perceptions are up

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,040
to date with the latest versions now I'm

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,440
not saying that you need every single

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,930
minor point but every so often maybe

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:42,930
once twice a year check it out is not a

00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:45,060
bad idea again people are the community

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,760
so when we're talking about people we

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,460
need to talk about inclusivity inviting

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,850
everyone to the party and introducing

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,670
everyone to everybody it's really hard

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,990
sometimes you just can't see someone and

00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,790
you think yeah I know them but i'm not

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,230
sure and it's kind of scary it's really

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,640
nice if you notice someone like that to

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,530
make the first step for them and just

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,970
introduce people like hi what's your

00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,440
name I'm you look like you want to be

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,420
introduced to someone I'll do the middle

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,520
manning and that's a really nice way to

00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,930
bring the community together and make

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,140
sure that we actually have a community

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,550
that is talking to each other it's also

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,450
good to have recognition for things that

00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:24,150
are not code on the wordpress project we

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,160
have these no badges we have different

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,480
teams and if you've been a speaker you

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,500
get a speaker's budge and then because

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,840
i'm on the community team i get

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,280
community badge as well but depending on

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,540
what part of the team on what things you

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,150
have done you get lots and lots of

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:39,870
different badges recognize that things

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:43,560
are not just about code words are one of

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,000
the most powerful tools we have let's

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,000
think about the words we choose when we

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,530
use when we communicate to each other

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,850
we're able to choose our words but when

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,620
I able to choose the way it affects

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,870
other people and that's something that

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,480
we have to be very careful of especially

00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:59,640
when you are trying to welcome new

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,400
people because you never know who it is

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,840
that you're talking to i'm a wordpress

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:10,650
engineer when I tell this to people some

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,950
people are saying a word press so so

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,560
insecure so blah blah I which don't get

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,930
me wrong i understand but air is not

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,799
really the right word that I would like

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,320
to use

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:26,650
it's not cool to be like belittling

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,159
other things when people say that to me

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,230
I'm always question why why do they have

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
this perception of WordPress and then

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,350
they tell me the last time they tried

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,210
WordPress was that like WordPress to

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,830
point something and it's like you do

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,340
realize WordPress project is 13 years

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:46,330
old it's quite old the 2 point 0 is 0

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:48,549
you know decade ago saying why did you

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:51,789
say that and he'll be really cool to

00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:53,980
keep an open mind or even better don't

00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:57,520
reply to some more ah yo WordPress

00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,309
instead say welcome it was really cool

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,530
yesterday majority of the people got it

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:04,120
right when I said WordPress everyone's

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,380
like oh that's really cool I'm glad you

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,780
could make it we can learn lots fun you

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,549
and I was like oh okay cool they're not

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,280
going to like take on my head I'm glad

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm here I'm feel safe and that's really

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,360
really important and that was the kind

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:22,179
of experience that when i get i'm going

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:24,280
to tell other people about diversity is

00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:27,490
a major thing that a lot of people in

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,990
tech talk about i'm going to say that

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,200
does versa teen has to be part of the

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,360
plan not an afterthought but i'm also

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,850
going to talk about diversity of

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,539
technology the tool choices the opens

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:42,640
the operating systems we need to respect

00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,230
people's choices on what they do because

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,600
they're not on a Mac doesn't make them

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,230
better or worse just makes their choices

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,580
for whatever reason their choices

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,039
respecting people's choices doesn't mean

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,440
that you'd have to agree with it just

00:25:54,039 --> 00:26:00,610
means being respectful of those choices

00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:03,490
I didn't talk at all to come a month ago

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,950
in Dublin just down the road could build

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,030
in an accessible community and then I

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,950
talked about all the different things

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:11,049
that we did at work out London I would

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,419
love for you to check out the slides

00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:16,539
throughout this URL which I will link to

00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:19,240
and it shares lots of lots of stories of

00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:21,340
how to build an accessible community the

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,039
gist of the accessible community is that

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,870
if you want to look at diversity and ink

00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,149
and therefore include as many people as

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,700
possible if you make it accessible to as

00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:32,620
many people as possible then you get a

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,250
more diverse pool that was the logic

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,760
behind the eye

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:39,040
and where cam London was the playground

00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,130
for that idea and the results are on

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,320
that slide and the ultimate underlying

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,990
and point of it all is make

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,350
accessibility a first class citizen of

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:57,820
your events of your project and people

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:59,980
will come now swag one thing that I want

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,720
to talk about swag with do it right or

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:07,090
don't do it at all is as simple as that

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:10,510
swag done wrong is not worth the energy

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:14,290
the cost of swagged among so I've done

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,030
right people talk about for lifetime so

00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,130
instead of pushing all your company's

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,170
money into swag that's down wrong just

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,580
do it right or save up and do something

00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:28,450
special next time when you have a more

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:30,880
of a bigger budget knowledge-sharing i

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:33,400
mentioned before respecting people's

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,370
choices and the reason why i say that is

00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,750
because people want to learn they really

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,730
learn to learn i wanted to learn

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,670
everyone in this event of what's to

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:45,340
learn you know more than someone and

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:48,850
lessons someone else in this room let

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,590
alone this event when speakers are on

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,630
stage they're just telling you their

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,630
experiences that they've figured out

00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,970
beforehand there is nothing stopping

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,190
anyone in this room standing on this

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,580
stage and sharing their experiences of

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,540
what they've had that's all I'm doing

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,700
there's also some really cool thing is

00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,000
that the droop whole group I've learnt

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,700
do including mentoring team which they

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,830
have a mentor of orientation right after

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,290
this talk so if you're thinking about

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:20,620
mentors on which I highly recommend go

00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:22,390
to the mentor at orientation is one way

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,620
to pass on your knowledge make sure that

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,110
someone doesn't jump through that

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:29,200
pothole that you had to jump through

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:31,270
there's also PHP mentoring as well and

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,450
if you want to learn something speak up

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,220
tell your local organizers that you want

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,410
to learn this subject because a lot of

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,940
the time local organizers don't know

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,650
what people want to learn about and

00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,760
therefore just pick things as the pic

00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:48,910
things come through ask questions

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,430
ask lots of questions no question is too

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:56,980
stupid and it's so important the slide I

00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:59,080
wrote again no question is too stupid at

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,970
PHP Northwest at the first event I ever

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,220
went to I asked a question they do a

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,710
talk on arrays and he asked the question

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,920
why so a pull an array pop a nut away

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,680
pull and away push and I was a student

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,890
of time just in my second year and the

00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,530
whole room went quiet the whole room I

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,940
was like if I just broke the internet

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,830
all these professionals have just going

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,430
quite a made this is something oddly

00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:26,290
wrong with this and they realized that i

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,180
was looking at airways horizontally and

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,760
i should be looking at it vertically but

00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,120
it proves the point no question is too

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:38,290
stupid being a newbie like today's pre

00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:42,100
no pointed out they have this open

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:43,180
mindedness attitude two wars a project

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,620
and it's something that we shouldn't be

00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:49,530
embracing and celebrating so with the

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,750
attitude I've mentioned a few times

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:55,960
welcome don't belittle and let's leave

00:29:52,750 --> 00:30:00,610
the door open we can educate new people

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,350
and old people we can support them when

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,790
they come in and out of the industry

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,060
because people come back and forth all

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,410
the time and we can be Mentors no matter

00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,330
how long have you been here if you've

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,190
been in the Drupal community if you've

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,230
been in the open source community for

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,680
more than a day you know more than

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,630
somebody already we can be cheerleaders

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,000
for people with trying and for people

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,500
who are doing the work we can also be

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,900
cheerleaders for people who are thinking

00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,550
about joining our communities because

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,800
when we're being cheerleaders and they

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,750
see that we're happy people and a

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,900
welcoming people they want to join us

00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:37,770
but also be respectful of other people's

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,210
opinions be empathetic to the fact that

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:43,390
you might just not agree with someone

00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:47,200
and gay them to where discussions are

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,790
happening and also to a good event and

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,490
if you're doing this already then

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,990
amazing please share your experiences

00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,270
where camp london is going to be

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,340
happening in march i would love for

00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,220
people in all communities to come and

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:04,420
share their experiences there

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:07,540
so just to wrap up bridge isn't that

00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:10,180
built overnight there is no quick fix of

00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,490
this but brick by brick we can create a

00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,260
two-way dialogue in our sibling

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,610
communities in our open source community

00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,390
and share the knowledge and experience

00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,560
we have with darker with MySQL with all

00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:25,620
these other things that we have in

00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:29,470
common but bridges also need maintenance

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,660
it's up to us to keep the our doors open

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,730
and the bridge is usable if we don't

00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,270
maintain those bridges those bridges

00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,470
will break apart and that's important

00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,590
that both sides of that bridge are

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,560
maintained we can improve our open

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,940
source community one step at a time

00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:49,080
because multi-dimensional problems need

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:53,350
multi financial solutions so I ask you

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:55,030
what solutions do you have the Drupal

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,490
community has a saying come for the

00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:00,640
communities they come for the code stay

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,890
for the community but I like to change

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,390
the sanela bit come for the code and

00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:09,400
stay for the open source community

00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:13,900
instead go away my a good which i think

00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:18,730
is thank you it i wish i'd like to have

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:20,890
to take any questions further than that

00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:28,240
thanks for staying on files for

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:29,980
listening and they're sorry the

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,510
microphone is over there and the AV

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,000
people said you have to go and speak in

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:37,030
that microphone so they can take they

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
can record the questions hey Jenny

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:43,600
Damian McKenna for the recording can you

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,340
please switch back to the slide with the

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:52,090
info on the mentoring sessions because

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:58,060
they're not on the schedule the third it

00:32:52,090 --> 00:33:01,140
did it that way I'm eating for days

00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:03,550
wells at one o'clock with lemon for

00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:09,630
excellent yes this should be on that's

00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:14,690
what point of location so Fausto

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:17,850
thank you I did have two quick questions

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,250
so do you have examples of swag done

00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,020
wrong without having to give names or

00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:26,090
anything but things that you found that

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:28,320
you so the easiest example is t-shirts

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,350
there's nothing no reason why as

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,330
organizers we can't take so wake up

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,520
London we do a thing where we have a

00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,050
chat box but says I understand that

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,910
t-shirts are not guaranteed but we're

00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:41,100
taking t-shirt sizes anyway just in case

00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,050
we do do them and then underneath we

00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,720
don't have all the sizes possible and

00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:47,520
then I have seen other events where they

00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,740
actually put the actual sizing chart

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,820
because a medium in the US and a medium

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,480
the UK are completely two different

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,160
things so that's really cool and there's

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,660
nothing wrong with the organizers then

00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,550
collaborate in all that data together

00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,890
and then giving it to sponsors to say

00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:03,810
this is what we expect if you're doing

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,120
one at a time so they know business

00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,800
Santa joys of how many female t-shirts

00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,230
how many male t-shirts of which size is

00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,510
in which particular sizing chart to

00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,490
expect so they can get better swag

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,399
because otherwise it's wasted textiles

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:20,270
and we've got plenty of that already the

00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:24,720
other question was have you had an

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:26,700
experience with either a resistance to

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,730
having events during the week or

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,970
preference for the weekend ones I've

00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:35,070
been to both PyCon runs kind of like

00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,530
this where it's a long-term one I

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:42,720
wouldn't say it's usually the issue of

00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:44,070
time of day although if you are a event

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,960
that's trying to bring more people from

00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,610
a different community it's always a good

00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,860
idea to look at what kind of events they

00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,510
have and when so the community would

00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,740
like in the WordPress community we're

00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,230
used to things happening during the

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,330
weekend something during the week you is

00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,040
kind of hard because you're working so

00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,210
you have to justify it to work so it

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,690
depends on the kind of people you are

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:05,340
going for but in general like you're not

00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,470
the only people who do things during the

00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,730
week one of the biggest issues when I

00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,860
was talking to like one of my colleagues

00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,930
about coming here because we have a

00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,400
workout EU which is kind of similar to

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,780
this and I said oh you should come to

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,460
drupalcon because it's their version of

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,590
work out EU and we could learn a thing

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,780
or two and they were like 500 pounds is

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,670
a lot of money and so that actually was

00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,200
the bigger factor

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,960
because obviously we would have to fly

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,400
in and stuff like that and so it's all

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,130
about cost factor I don't know if we

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,750
could do a kind of like buddy system

00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,890
where we give up two free tickets to

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,750
like different episodes projects or

00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,059
something to like kind of Ali's get them

00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,460
to entice to come along or something but

00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:43,309
I'm thinking from the top of my head

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,460
hurt so I'm all ears for any solution

00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:51,680
that we can come up with thank you thank

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:53,540
you hey and so my question is about kind

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,520
of organizers you mentioned there's a

00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:58,400
couple of events that seem to be

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,890
specifically around organizers and I'm

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,040
sharing their own kind of experience and

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:06,640
resources and where it was the best

00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:11,030
place to find out about that information

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,099
good question because of my community

00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,690
addict my twitter feed is basically

00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:18,680
organ I just telling me when things are

00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,490
going to happen and there's various lots

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,750
of lots of various different

00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,740
spreadsheets that people have tried and

00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,730
there's loads and loads of different

00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:27,950
like lists so I tend to just keep my ear

00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:31,809
on the ground I guess I should be

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:34,160
showing this is some formal manner yeah

00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:37,220
let's let's come over the solution for

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,020
that yeah but there is one that if your

00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,549
honor if your user group organizer or a

00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,829
conference organizer one that you should

00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:44,599
check out is comp comp it's based in the

00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:46,099
UK was in bristol a share I don't know

00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,109
if they're doing another one but they

00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:50,900
that whole thing was talking it was

00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:53,569
literally an event for organizers it was

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,799
so matter it was funny and it's where

00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:57,500
everyone shares their pain points of how

00:36:54,799 --> 00:37:00,290
to sponsor and all this stuff but yeah

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,849
i'm i'm more than happy to get around a

00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:05,000
table like come up with a solution that

00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:10,160
like everyone be happy with cool thank

00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,790
you a bomb hello hi Johnny oh I'm short

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,119
compared to me yes oh my is that um I'm

00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,799
my canelo so there's been talk over the

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,540
years in the Drupal community and this

00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:22,430
is kind of a wordpress question for you

00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,710
but or yeah yeah can you any question

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:27,500
for you about how we can better surface

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,450
non-code contributions and I saw you had

00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,540
a slide up there of I guess the

00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,640
WordPress profile page a couple of

00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,130
badges

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:40,630
yeah I'm not even sure which way I'm

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:44,859
going now going wrong way and we'll get

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:47,140
there well while you're frantically yeah

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:51,099
come around so my question is are those

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:53,829
badges are they awarded is not the right

00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:58,170
word are they given to the user or the

00:37:53,829 --> 00:38:01,930
user selected given to the user ok I

00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:05,289
guess on let me see on your second given

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:08,470
to something quick wave pioneer so I get

00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:12,490
your question is how do how do users get

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:16,180
these badges sure ok so if you have

00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:18,819
spoken to any work camp you're in the

00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:21,430
word camp website you you get you get

00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:23,289
your username gets added to it and then

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,119
that gets linked to your profile and so

00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,619
it knows that you've been a speaker so

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,029
you only need to speak once and you'll

00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:30,099
get the speaker's badge if you're on the

00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:31,539
community team the community want either

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,010
you've been an organizer of a work camp

00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:34,930
and therefore you're on the organizers

00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,690
list on the workout which you as a team

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,640
you would in put that information in or

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:42,130
you're someone like me who works on the

00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,190
community team as a core contribution to

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:48,549
the thing so you get added to the list

00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:51,569
as well so the core one which you get

00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:55,150
which is actually just to arrow signs

00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:58,450
that's the core team one and if you do

00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,009
any patches or even like do a patch and

00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,619
then it gets removed or whatever like

00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:04,720
there's some way that they use svn to

00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:06,250
basically pull those out and then make

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,940
sure that all the user names have those

00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:12,579
in their different teams have different

00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,920
rules most of them are you've done

00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:17,980
something once therefore you get this

00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,759
some of them are not automatically

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:23,289
automatic yet but the meta team which is

00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:26,440
our kind of mothership that looks

00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:28,839
afterwards all is working through making

00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,789
all that automated the problem with that

00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:32,950
is some teams want it to be like you do

00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:34,930
three contributions to translations and

00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:37,150
then you get the badge so each team

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:41,609
makes up the rules and then the metal

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:44,619
team builds it so yeah it's pretty cool

00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:46,359
small gamification of it some people

00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:47,109
don't like game finding it some people

00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,400
do but

00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:50,619
it's nice to be recognized for things

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,359
that are not code related ones cause

00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,789
code is easy code you can just get the

00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:57,430
URLs but even in the code one they're

00:39:54,789 --> 00:40:01,150
trying to work out how to how to have

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:03,160
recognition for people who contribute by

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,039
raising book tickets are not only book

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,769
tickets but then also testers so how do

00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,450
you recognize testers and QA people and

00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:13,059
stuff like that so it becomes this

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,009
really big problem that we haven't got

00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:16,390
the full answer to I know that the

00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:21,430
Drupal community are in discussions of

00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:24,099
this a similar problem but pro tip where

00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,690
camp Europe is hosting the we have our

00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:28,690
community sorts because community

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,680
summits by annually or annually kind of

00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:35,190
but the next one is going to be in Paris

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,769
june next year i do believe it's june

00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:40,210
but yeah one of my plans is to invite

00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,369
some of the Drupal community because I

00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,989
think we're having a lot of the same

00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:46,089
kind of conversations and even if we go

00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:48,640
with different solutions having the same

00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:50,200
having those like you know bouncing off

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,779
conversations like I was doing with

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,980
Damian and Mike just that it's a great

00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:56,170
way just to spearhead those

00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,539
conversations to see what people are

00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,619
thinking about so yeah I would love to

00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,809
see some of the trip alchemy into there

00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:04,390
and if I have any power over it it will

00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:07,119
happen I will know it's behind me so I'm

00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:10,210
rakib asking questions yeah so just

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,920
because I'm lazy aren't those batches

00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,630
clickable like if you were to click on

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,200
like a speaker badge would you see all

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:19,779
of these oh I don't think so that was

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,900
such a cool thing can someone like

00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:24,309
remind me to popeyes another ticket that

00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,420
would be that would make total sense so

00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,910
if you click on it then i'll go on

00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,400
something make the team of white is and

00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:34,749
like how to get involved oh that's so

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,519
cool yes we shall do that'll okay my

00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:38,829
list of things to do is missing I can

00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,499
see this happening that go on alright so

00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,950
then you know you said whenever someone

00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:47,079
speaks at a word cam on the

00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:50,589
automatically get the badge so I think

00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,700
that's correct me if I'm wrong I'm just

00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:54,519
kind of confirming this that's a result

00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,650
of the fact that but the word camps are

00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:58,450
kind of their their websites at least

00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,820
our kind of centrally run yes that's

00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:03,190
correct okay so in the Drupal community

00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,800
we don't have that is it more of an

00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:08,620
issue for us where you know campsites

00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,850
are independently built and run so we

00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,960
don't have that central clearinghouse

00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:17,500
for that type of data yeah it's a hard

00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,730
problem to solve based on your what my

00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,820
understanding of the current Drupal

00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:24,460
situation is but open source projects

00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:27,790
are amazing because any person can make

00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:30,370
a change and so if this is the problem

00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:32,170
in your community now then the question

00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,270
you should be asking yourself is are you

00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,430
going to allow this be a problem in your

00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,590
community in the future Oh as a

00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,620
community or are you going to fix this

00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:44,560
in some manner away maybe there's some

00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:46,360
oooff way of like using the Drupada old

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,180
thing so it's all in the Jupiter all

00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,440
profiles that would be really nice

00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,660
obviously I don't know how the system's

00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,940
completely set up I'm completely taking

00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,290
from the top of my head but this is what

00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,090
I love about open source communities

00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:00,280
it's like we can have a conversation and

00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,280
come up with crazy ideas and then

00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,380
basically go which one's going to stick

00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,450
there is nothing to stop you or anyone

00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,710
in this room or anyone here in the group

00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,930
or community or the open source

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,070
community make that patch and start

00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:14,620
making that change oh you can at least

00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,790
start having that discussion all right

00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,710
do we still have more time oh I'm sorry

00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,360
I'll ask one more question then I'll sit

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:23,650
down so is about the budget since I've

00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,620
got a point in space um no it's sorta

00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:29,440
but go ahead well it's just to say that

00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:33,790
um the walls discussion of the badges

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,700
back in Drupal Amsterdam yeah and I put

00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:40,300
the video factory still up and it was a

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,100
proposal by Rachel Lawson to use the

00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,650
open badges standard which is a kind of

00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,360
a Mozilla standard for maximally

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:48,160
distributed by two so you don't have to

00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,700
rely on drupal.org serving it you don't

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,230
have to rely on particular provider and

00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,600
just that talks philip and rachel is

00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,450
going to be in the mint orientation next

00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,590
so the sliders up just now about that so

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,790
if they don't wanted to talk to her

00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,710
after this they can definitely find

00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,510
during the next session yeah i mean like

00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:09,280
one of the things i really like about

00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:11,320
the wordpress we call them ticket

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,330
champions is that we have a group of

00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,560
people who will champion one ticket on

00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,180
the track ticket

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,860
basically say what is the status of this

00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,050
how can we move this and that's

00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,120
literally that only job and to keep an

00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,950
eye on that one ticket that is bugging

00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,810
them for the life so if this is over

00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,240
they are passionate about if you can't

00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:30,340
do the code if you can't have you don't

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,260
have a facilities to like physically

00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,630
make it happen what you can do is just

00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,000
go so where is this up to because things

00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,740
get forgotten things people people

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,880
forget to talk about it and things get

00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,250
forgotten so something like that is

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,540
really cool we need people to talk about

00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,730
it make sure that it becomes like

00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:50,140
important enough to actually get I'm

00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:51,820
become a higher priority for the team go

00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,920
for it last question so I'm just curious

00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,230
what is the WordPress community team

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,970
responsible for what's their purview and

00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:01,450
the WordPress community team is

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,860
responsible supporting and distributing

00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:07,690
our global sponsorship money we have a

00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:12,220
pool of money that we use to sponsor and

00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:13,630
to give sponsor grants to work camps

00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,210
across the world when you were become a

00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:19,060
workout and also to a meetup so we all

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,500
pay for their meetup com accounts when

00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,920
they joined the official chapter account

00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:26,590
and also venues when they do a

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,350
submission to the venue costs it's based

00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:31,900
on the Big Mac cost because we believe

00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:33,160
that we want our community organizers to

00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,430
concentrate on looking after the

00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,870
community rather than running after

00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,480
sponsorship which is one of the hardest

00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:41,950
things you have to do so if we can take

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,330
an ill a bit that burning by giving them

00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:47,800
twenty percent six percent of their

00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:50,200
budget and also like any any excess of

00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,780
that money as well so if you over if you

00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,550
under budget and then you've got a bit

00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,410
extra it never comes out of an

00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:59,230
organizers pocket that's kind of the

00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,240
ethos around it we tell organizers to

00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,800
try not mean that that doesn't mean that

00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,200
they get so I burn through all the money

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,090
and burn for all the the path the part

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,690
but it does mean that they have some

00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:13,740
financial stability and support there

00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:16,120
and also in the US we have an insurance

00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:18,640
for all of the u.s. and North America's

00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:21,250
work camps so that they are all insured

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,930
automatically in the UK we have to buy

00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,970
them ourselves and in different paces

00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,980
who have to do different things we also

00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:28,150
distribute swag to which includes

00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,730
lanyards

00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,619
acres and badges and they get sent to

00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,730
all of them we basically say we know

00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:35,680
you're going to event coming up would

00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,960
you like some swag they reply back with

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,319
an e quivered snail mail address and a

00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,569
phone number because customs is a pain

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:46,029
hmm and then send all that through and

00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:48,099
also we have a support channel open

00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:49,839
offices where organizers for both meet

00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,980
Albert and work camps come together and

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:55,240
ask questions sometimes we like other

00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,400
meetup organizers and other work camp

00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,049
organizers will chime in and say hey we

00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,329
did this for Singapore and we did this

00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:03,789
for Bulgaria and we did this for you

00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:06,400
know Oslo maybe this will work in your

00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:08,109
local area and then sometimes you know

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,490
the community said oh I heard about you

00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:11,500
know the Japanese community go out for

00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,880
sushi as one of their meetup things when

00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,890
you know people have these issues so

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,480
there's a centralized community of

00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:20,980
community organizers and stuff like that

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,329
and we also try and support any events

00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,150
that are happening where people come up

00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:26,680
with new ideas so before I even joined

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,420
community team I came up with the idea

00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,140
of a contributor day that was a

00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,700
standalone event not attached to a work

00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,520
camp which is what the original thing

00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,020
was I said the magic we can do this on

00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,569
our own we don't need like all these

00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,880
fancy things and I was out of pocket by

00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:44,289
200 pounds because of the venue and then

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,289
someone said how much is this costing

00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:48,220
you and I was like oh just a venue

00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:50,589
actually I should probably get some food

00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,180
too and they're like oh you should get

00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:54,369
some sponsorships and my solution to get

00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,680
sponsorship was to sell tickets the

00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:57,849
tickets meant absolutely nothing you

00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,890
didn't me the ticket to go to the event

00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:02,859
it was just you can buy tickets in him

00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,809
and in orders of 10 pounds to basically

00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:06,609
pay off and there was a maximum of 20

00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:07,869
tickets and I was like if you want to

00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:09,609
give me my money back this is how you

00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:11,920
give me my money back and it was really

00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:14,470
really cool it was really simple but yet

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,880
like um sometimes I just run off with

00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,670
things on people have to point this out

00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,319
to me so no things like that the

00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,750
community team were just in currently

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,140
discussing how to expand our financial

00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,190
aid across more events like that because

00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,440
when I was doing that there was no

00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,910
financial aid for like these special

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,140
events that happen that people are

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:37,750
trying to celebrate their community with

00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:39,910
we also do a workout mentoring as well

00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:42,010
and meetup mentoring as well and we also

00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,020
look after any meetups

00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:46,120
workouts that go into disarray so you

00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,510
know when they go into dormant state and

00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,070
we try and find a new organizer and like

00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,380
find out why things that are happening

00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,900
and support those as well we've also had

00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,400
to deal with political riots and all

00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,720
this other stuff that people get the

00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,480
wrong as another stick so we helped

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,220
write various legal stuff which is kind

00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,960
of boring but yeah lots and lots of

00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,740
support for our organizers because they

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,850
are the grassroots point of contact and

00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:15,040
so it's really important that we support

00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:16,710
those people any other questions sorry I

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,940
do realize those a really long answer

00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:20,440
cool I think it's lunch time or

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,650
mentoring time if you're going to be a

00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:27,100
mentor orientation for the next few days

00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:29,830
I would love to talk to you all I will

00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,850
be here till tomorrow morning so please

00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,930
