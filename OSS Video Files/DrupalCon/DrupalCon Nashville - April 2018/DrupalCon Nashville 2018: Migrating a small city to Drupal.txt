Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Migrating a small city to Drupal
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	After ten years, we relaunched the City of Bloomington's public website. While any website migration is difficult, I transition from in-house CMS to Drupal came with a lot of challenges and considerations. This talk reflects on the lessons learned in launching a new website essentially from the ground up while managing your existing web presence.

Some of the things we'll cover include:

- Tackling content debt. How we cut the site from several thousand pages to just 500 without causing a mutiny.

- Managing web governance. Ways to assign responsibility for managing content across departments, by engaging with stakeholders early and often through the process using actionable goals, documentation & timelines to move things forward.

- Balancing user needs with technical considerations. As a development team having to integrate UX considerations and handling content, we had more than just software issues to balance. How do you work with a team of developers to manage these responsibilities, without causing lots of extra work, and keeping users satisfied throughout the process into post-launch.
