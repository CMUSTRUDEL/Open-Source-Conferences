Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Migrating a small city to Drupal
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	After ten years, we relaunched the City of Bloomington's public website. While any website migration is difficult, I transition from in-house CMS to Drupal came with a lot of challenges and considerations. This talk reflects on the lessons learned in launching a new website essentially from the ground up while managing your existing web presence.

Some of the things we'll cover include:

- Tackling content debt. How we cut the site from several thousand pages to just 500 without causing a mutiny.

- Managing web governance. Ways to assign responsibility for managing content across departments, by engaging with stakeholders early and often through the process using actionable goals, documentation & timelines to move things forward.

- Balancing user needs with technical considerations. As a development team having to integrate UX considerations and handling content, we had more than just software issues to balance. How do you work with a team of developers to manage these responsibilities, without causing lots of extra work, and keeping users satisfied throughout the process into post-launch.

well hello earthlings greetings hello

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,370
you all look really excited to be here

00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,410
free I appreciate that I appreciate fist

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,120
pump in the back I'm sorry if you've

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,770
ever experienced what I do it talks but

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,270
it's not like the thing where someone's

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,140
really boring so if you're looking for

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,369
that you should just save yourself

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,510
trouble and leave now

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,789
wrong likes jokes it's just what happens

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,240
anyway I'm Ron Bronson this Charles

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,279
Brandt we're here from the blatant

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,809
Indiana city of Bloomington Cheryl still

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,989
works there I don't we'll get into that

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,520
later though not really we didn't fight

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,800
it was totally amicable but at any rate

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,530
um we launched our website a couple

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,730
months ago moved it from an LC message

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,620
rupal we're going to talk to you a

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,180
little bit about that and hopefully

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,250
after you have a million questions for

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,600
us about what you're working on and how

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,149
we can help you save yourself some time

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,170
and trouble or about what we did or

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:02,879
whatever sound great all right I'll take

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,409
that enthusiasm Charles tell them about

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,290
yourself Charles

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,540
so I'm from the city of Bloomington in

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,409
Indiana I always like to specify because

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,850
there are many cities of Bloomington

00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:18,810
across the country but we happen to be

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:22,590
the one in Indiana that's the home of

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:27,720
Indiana University so we are a pretty

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,380
small college town so I think when

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,549
students are there we're about 80,000

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,670
when the students leave in the summer

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:40,619
where you go down to about 40,000 so not

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:44,970
a real big city but we are fortunate in

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,119
that we have a small team of developers

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,610
in-house that let us take on projects

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:55,890
like migrating our city's website to

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:59,040
Drupal so we have a number of open

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:04,020
source projects that we make available

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,849
on our city's github page and we are

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,530
always eager to share share what we've

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,319
learned and what we've done with other

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,569
cities so

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,340
absolutely reach out to us and let us

00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:21,340
know Charles what you do before you got

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:24,439
to city of Lincoln this is about you

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,060
I've been a developer for quite some

00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:33,829
time working with Python and PHP and

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:39,220
JavaScript and I've just been very happy

00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:43,639
to be working at my municipal government

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:47,840
developing open source software so cool

00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:50,000
what about you wrong I'm Rob Bronson I

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,819
currently work for the federal

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,870
government digital agency 18f I used to

00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,849
work for the city Bloomington before

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,919
that before that I did a lot of other

00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:01,400
things sort of all over the place

00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:06,379
state universities working sort of at

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,659
the intersection of UX and and content

00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,129
strategy and digital and whatever else

00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,329
I've been working on the web for a long

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:20,209
time too yeah I still live in

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:21,290
Bloomington and Google me so today we're

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,060
going to talk to you a little bit about

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,500
a redesign and kind of how this all went

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,930
down it's a sort of a laborious process

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,340
but an exciting one in a sense like

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,430
Charles said the cool thing about the

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,229
say Bloomington's web team is that means

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,609
for a city of our size punch is really

00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:36,650
above its weight in terms of

00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,909
contributing to open source in terms of

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,319
being able to develop early co-op

00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,919
locations maybe there's a million things

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,900
the city's done like I said again again

00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,489
compared to its size and in the

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,129
relations website was one of those

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,599
gargantuan things and so we're gonna

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,040
talk to you today if you did like I said

00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,540
we have one slide where if nothing else

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,859
if you like ah you know what that

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,720
Bronson guy a little too much or

00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,310
whatever else nothing else you'll find

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,280
out what we did and you can leave but

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,169
don't we went from an in-house CMS to

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,599
Drupal 8 and you're like we can go to

00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,859
seven we'll explain why in a second we

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,079
got rid of initially when we launched

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:12,799
the site we went from several thousand

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,599
pages of content to five hundred I know

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,159
I know what you're thinking who let you

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,470
do that and why do you have still jobs

00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:21,469
maybe that's why Ron left no it's not

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,350
why we'll get into why we did that and

00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:26,170
how we're able to do that

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,670
throughout this process we also also

00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,110
think we do which is really a while that

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,760
people are always horrified about is

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,250
that we went from a site that allowed

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,570
people to edit content by department so

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,880
if you're in transportation you edit

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,140
transportation pages if you're in the

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,730
mayor's office you can edit everything

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,870
if you're in you actually you couldn't

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,860
but you know you could only get those

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,620
pages that were assigned to your

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,060
department on the new launch everyone in

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,280
the city who has access to the website

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,590
can edit any page on the website except

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,030
for the front page and yet no one's

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,980
abused that power had been fired for

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,810
doing so yet I know again you're

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,970
horrified by this but we'll tell you why

00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,380
we did it and why that worked for us and

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,970
the last thing of course is talking a

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,340
little bit about some of the content

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,170
strategy behind what we did in changing

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,090
our thinking about how we structured the

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,710
site from a site that was more

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,440
organizational and focused on our org

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,570
chart and went towards a structure that

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,280
was more contextual and focused more

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,290
only people actually search websites and

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,220
how that benefited us and so with that

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:26,280
Charles is gonna start you off yes so a

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:29,290
screenshot of our older site again we

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,840
apparently didn't quite get the message

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,680
that the number one no no when you think

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,410
about launching a website is I've got an

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,900
idea I'll make my own content management

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:48,040
system don't do that everybody here I'm

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:52,330
sure can agree with that and so but we

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,780
did and that's what we we ran with on

00:05:52,330 --> 00:06:01,260
our site for about ten years

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:05,860
so yeah we we we had our in-house CMS

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:07,990
and as Ron said with that our previous

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,240
iteration what we did was every

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:15,300
department had their own content and

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,440
that was our way of enforcing that only

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,320
people with the right permissions would

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,210
be able to edit that content but in

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,520
practice at least at our city

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:31,120
organization content doesn't really fit

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,250
in a specific department all the time so

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,100
there's often a lot of crossover from

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,380
one department to another we're

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,200
somebody in planning and transportation

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,020
will need to edit a page that's shared

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,940
with our Public Works Department and and

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,700
that's just the way content is I think

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:54,400
in most organizations so that type of

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:57,130
structure of enforcing ownership across

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,480
or within a department is very brittle

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:04,300
and it ends up causing a lot of requests

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,910
to hey I need I need permission to edit

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,560
this page and then somebody else needs

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,720
permission to edit that page and it's a

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,740
it's a back and forth thing so I don't

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,300
recommend it after after our experience

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,270
another thing as you saw in that that

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,400
previous slide our old site was not

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:31,290
responsive we actually had developed a

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:35,070
separate mobile version of our website

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,900
that only showed on mobile devices and

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,020
as you can see in the fine print there

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:44,500
in our Google Analytics the third most

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,169
popular page on our site was I really

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,500
want to view the full site so that

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:55,120
mobile that separate mobile page was was

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,130
not a good approach for us and so our

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,770
goal with the new site was something a

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:03,160
little bit more responsive maintain it

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:07,750
in one CMS and make sure that it works

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,510
across all devices so I'll turn it over

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,730
to Ron here cool so I showed up to say

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,240
Bloomington got the most almost two

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,350
years ago and when I got the site at the

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,400
rate three design a big already is

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,169
already ongoing

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,360
so we inherited we had a Drupal seven

00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:23,890
reduce website with a totally different

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,280
design that if you go to the site it

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,110
looks different than you see now and in

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,180
December of life two years ago we

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,650
decided after going to some whole

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,150
process and so Charles can well laugh

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,039
about this but when I got hired and

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,020
we're up selling them on me and I'm like

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,089
I've done a ton of redesigns redesigns

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,310
and my saying I love redesigns which is

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:45,760
totally true and also seriously have

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,440
issues but but at any rate I'm like well

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,150
six months will knock this out it'll be

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,529
great well totally launched it

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,020
four months into that six months I'm

00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:55,570
like yeah that's exactly what happened

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,240
he's like um maybe we should think about

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,070
something different so so after doing

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
some research and internally and talking

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,610
to folks and sort of sitting down and

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,050
saying we should reboot everything one

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,570
of the things we decided was to upgrade

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,640
a drupe relay and the main reason for us

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,430
doing that among other things was that

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,170
for our political culture and will and

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,510
just internally it made sense for us was

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,220
going to be smart for us to say should

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,050
we upgrade this now or later for us

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,750
doing it then when the old site was

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,820
still up in Woking and Isla thing to is

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,860
for our internal users because they had

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,270
used that old site for so long there

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,470
wasn't really the end they knew the new

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,210
site was coming we had talked to them

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,830
about it they had heard about it

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,960
but there wasn't this clamoring for a

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,110
like was a new thing coming so that gave

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,390
us a little bit of insulation for it was

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,980
a little bit of a boy who cries wolf

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,279
yeah oh yes

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,890
the the new site is coming brand new

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,420
site is coming constantly lots of that

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,040
every six months and then alike they

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,390
talk and people say to me and I'm still

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,980
new they're like yeah y'all said that

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,350
six months ago and I'm like look I

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,800
wasn't here then but they didn't care

00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,650
about that

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,300
so we decided to upgrade a Drupal eight

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:04,180
around Christmastime so clearly we had a

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,370
really good Christmas but but it was

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,570
actually a really good decision I mean

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,260
in that process we learned a lot of

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,630
things like read the manual I'm

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,700
embarrassed by how long it took me to

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,470
actually read the drupal manual and the

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,550
documentation is great yes should read

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,620
it it it helps you a lot

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,940
exactly the other thing we did was is we

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,070
had gone through several iterations of

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,420
our information architecture and a lot

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,740
of that was focused on departmental

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,209
content and going to departments is

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,190
saying what do you what's the most

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:36,580
important thing what's the answer

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,930
all of it yes only five folks look at

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,130
that page in the last year but it's

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,220
still really important to somebody and

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,350
so that made us think about okay so how

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,480
do folks actually browse our site how do

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,130
we actually organize content how do we

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,150
deal with those shared pages because it

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,459
turns out there's a lot of shared

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,980
content in our case situations where

00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:59,230
like the City Council has pages but the

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,490
clerk's office manages those pages they

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,529
were in different apartments on our old

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,730
site so whenever you wanted to shift

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,259
you had to go in and change the

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,689
department give them temporary

00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:11,529
permission and then change it back it's

00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:13,240
totally not a problem and ultimately

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:16,269
checked our misconceptions about how

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,560
folks browsed our site you know we had

00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,209
some ideas about how we thought people

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,889
looked at our site how they view things

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,240
we talked to some we did some small user

00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,470
testing we didn't have a lot of time or

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,149
money to really do extensive user

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,529
testing but we were able to work with

00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,870
some students at the university to do a

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:32,199
little bit of it and helped us to so

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,339
recalibrate how we decided to go forward

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,809
but really the biggest thing with eight

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,160
with us was giving us the chance to

00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:38,259
really dive into Drupal in a more

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,689
earnest way and to figure out how it

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:45,009
could help us do what we wanted to do

00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:46,749
faster so um the other thing too is some

00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,889
of the challenges we had so obviously I

00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:49,809
don't know where all of you work and I'd

00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,100
love to hear more about that but one of

00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,290
the things that working at a political

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,209
organization issue run into actually at

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,350
the local government level is you deal

00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,730
with all even if you're not directly

00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,959
okay the mayor's office doesn't come

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,610
down and find out what we're doing on a

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,829
regular basis I mean I tea in general

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,149
but not the website but one of the

00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,639
challenges of being in an organization

00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:07,660
is the mayor's change so it has happened

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,490
of course Charles is there longer than

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,309
me so they showed up in the new mayor

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,259
came in so that's not good or bad as

00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:15,819
much as it changes how you focus on your

00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,649
priorities so that person comes in and

00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,040
says I want to focus on this this and

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,050
this

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,360
that website project might get pushed

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,649
behind because you know to them that's

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,350
not necessarily the first thing they

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:27,759
want to focus on and so as an IT team

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,139
you trying to figure out constantly with

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,430
developer is trying to figure out how

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,290
you allocate those resources and

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,129
everything else obviously a small team

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,720
of four really three and a half right

00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,610
focusing on not just supporting the

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,589
website but also something like thirty

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,610
different applications internally a lot

00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,740
of those in-house that were built

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,990
in-house that are managing for all these

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,029
different tools like the animal shelter

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,529
and in parks and recreation and all

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,829
these other systems that are being

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,959
supported in-house the web team is also

00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:57,459
part of the larger IT team and

00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,199
supporting some of their applications as

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,999
well so there's a lot of priorities

00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,379
shifting that happens so really you get

00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,089
me coming in and this is sort of my only

00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:05,709
job was working on the website and

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:06,970
dealing with customers but then our

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,709
other developers are having other things

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,120
to do and that was challenging and also

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,100
limited resources you can't just go buy

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,779
something when you want it I mean we

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,329
were I think having been a lot of places

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,920
I tell Charles I appreciated

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,569
we were able to do we were able to do

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,579
but you also just didn't have a

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:23,860
limitless budget to just you know hire a

00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:26,139
new person or do whatever and so that

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,059
allowed that sort of the constraints

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,799
there were difficult and we worked

00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,720
through them but those some of the

00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:36,790
barriers that we had to work with and so

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:40,779
yeah so again going back to what Ron

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,759
hinted at where we started by engaging

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,470
with our departments and saying well

00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,429
what what content do you want to migrate

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:51,549
to the new site and when as Ron said

00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,029
everybody said everything yes we want it

00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:55,389
all

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:58,360
and so we I had initially spent some

00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,999
time creating these spreadsheets of all

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,279
the content kind of keeping it grouped

00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:05,279
by that departmental structure and

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:14,139
quickly found that that that just didn't

00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:16,749
work for us we won we couldn't really

00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:19,980
identify what those core content pieces

00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:22,540
were and two we started to realize that

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,910
organizing our content around the

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,029
organization's departmental structure

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:30,100
the organization's org chart is not how

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:33,730
our end-users were really engaging with

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,220
that content they they wanted to find a

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,410
service to help them in their life they

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,779
didn't want to know how the city was

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,669
organized they didn't want to know what

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:47,980
department was responsible for that

00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:51,610
content so we we stayed we stayed

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:56,009
engaged with our content creators in in

00:14:51,610 --> 00:15:00,209
the departments but ultimately what we

00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:05,410
decided was the most effective was to

00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:12,040
use data and Google Analytics is a

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:14,230
wonderful thing so we we started running

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,269
out of time and we just needed to

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,209
migrate the content and what better

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,739
content to migrate then the stuff that

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:24,629
everybody's looking for the stuff that

00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:29,030
everybody is actually using and that

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:31,550
gave us a very clear easy-to-follow list

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:35,060
what content to migrate you start at the

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:37,280
top you work your way down and you very

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,450
quickly find the other pages that need

00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:44,300
to come to complete that content but it

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,700
gives us it gave us a really clear

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:55,420
easy-to-follow path for that content

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:58,970
migration so yeah and as we did this we

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:03,740
we got a chance to see all of the pages

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:07,940
that had kind of gotten lost in the old

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:10,460
system so we would often find duplicates

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,850
for the same type of content that

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,160
multiple people had created but didn't

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,760
really know that somebody else had

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,830
created a page for that already or going

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,380
back to that departmental structure for

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,810
permissions maybe somebody in one

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,880
department created a page that was very

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:33,160
similar to a page in another department

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,810
but because of that artificial barrier

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,530
they weren't able to really collaborate

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:44,090
on that content so what we found in our

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:46,910
audit was that a lot of those pages were

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:50,570
just abandoned or not kept up to date

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:55,130
and and that really led us to these

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:58,300
these two ideas of anybody can edit

00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:02,000
content on our new site we we loved the

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:06,530
revision history in Drupal that is key

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,650
so that way not only do we know who made

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,800
a change but we can facilitate people

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:17,750
working together on that content and and

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:20,270
and there is some security there or

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,060
peace of mind knowing that if anybody

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:27,440
makes a mistake in editing the content

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:30,410
there's a way to get back at least in

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,630
our organization we've found that the

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,730
real challenge is getting people to make

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,940
those updates and keep content up to

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,830
date so any anything that we can do to

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,640
remove those

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:45,850
is actually a good thing and and then

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,850
the second thing that we did was we do

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,610
not allow anybody to create a new page

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:57,730
that that is something that we control

00:17:51,610 --> 00:18:02,890
in I TS and that has already saved us I

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,990
think a lot of extra content we we get

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,970
requests initially we had set up a

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,900
Google Form but now we just ask people

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,940
to send an email to the webmaster asking

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,770
for these new pages and what we find is

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:19,990
that I would say nine times out of ten

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:24,070
almost I mean it's quite frequent that

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,750
just searching our sites content I find

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,690
the page that they're looking for and it

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:33,100
already exists and they just needed to

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:35,200
know where it was and and know that they

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,910
have the ability to make changes on that

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,280
page and feel empowered to do that so

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:44,260
yeah turn it back over to Ron here so

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,940
the decision to migrate the top five

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,740
minor pages wasn't just a brilliant

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,480
master stroke I mean it was but that's

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,460
not why we decided to do it was mostly a

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,250
time thing so like I said about

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,690
political will we went from kind of like

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,160
it's gonna be a site other sites coming

00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,440
other sites coming - hey the site need

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,930
to be launched in April it was January

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,110
and we decided to migrate to Drupal 8

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:07,360
and we didn't know it super well okay

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,280
great and then in April they're like

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,200
okay you have two weeks and then it made

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,900
their lokay we have three weeks and then

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,430
the end the Mather said next week the

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,130
begins unit said June 10th and in the

00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:22,330
press conference it finally lost in June

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,730
but the point is is because of that

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,560
constant change it forced us to be a

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,390
make sure that we did launch it wasn't a

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,910
site of just like nothing but also

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,620
figuring out again when people go to the

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,330
site what's the most of what are the

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,770
most important things the other thing

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,940
that we did and I don't know if it's a

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,350
slide for it later but I do want to

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,900
mention it since it's here it's a

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,220
separate system that's for our board and

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,100
Commission agendas that are not housed

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,530
within our CMS that just has the beauty

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,760
of that was that it allows some folks

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,010
who are not even city employees at all

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,359
to be able to upload content and update

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,739
update content

00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,179
and there's a whole process there but

00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:57,309
the beauty of that was it did enable us

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,559
to be tied to that content inside of the

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:02,079
website as well and real quick I

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:03,969
realized that we didn't have a slide for

00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,539
this but that that's another thing that

00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:11,589
I would caution really any organization

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:15,429
is don't get bogged down in the

00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:17,859
integrations with other sites so that's

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:19,869
something that I would actually say

00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:22,359
that's one of the big reasons why we

00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:25,199
didn't get our Drupal 7 instance up and

00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:28,599
running is that we spent a lot of time

00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:31,029
working on these custom integrations

00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:34,749
custom Drupal modules with our other

00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:37,059
systems and it's very easy to lose sight

00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:41,289
of the core content the core content

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:44,739
that you need to migrate and and get

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:47,739
lost in how do i how do i integrate this

00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:50,769
this third-party system or this external

00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:52,809
system and those things are good to do

00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:54,579
those integrations are good to do and

00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:59,049
we've we've been able to tackle them

00:20:54,579 --> 00:21:01,149
since but if you're just starting an

00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:04,119
initial site migration or content

00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:08,049
migration a new site really focusing on

00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:12,879
that that new content so how we got from

00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:14,499
the old site to the new site and one of

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,909
the things just briefly really really

00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:17,139
briefly about some of the design changes

00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,399
we made the most specific thing we were

00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:21,279
trying to do with Drupal was great about

00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,509
letting us do this was that we did we

00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,089
felt like on the old site that wasn't a

00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:26,529
very good sense of place and in in some

00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,209
of our previous iterations of the web

00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:29,919
site we didn't really do a great job of

00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:31,359
like promoting photos and like trying

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,739
and not having a ton of photos we get

00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,749
one photos everywhere partially because

00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:36,190
of just the way end users tend to like

00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:38,349
want to put things and random places

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,879
they don't belong and so we just we sort

00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:41,799
of after a lot of iteration and some

00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:43,179
design changes we decided to and if you

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:44,529
go to the site now you can see it on

00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:46,809
different pages it's sort of having a

00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:48,819
big giant picture that users can edit

00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:51,399
those and each page is different every

00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:52,239
page has one and it turned it up being a

00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:55,359
really good compromise

00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:57,369
um internally for us but you know and so

00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,459
I guess what you're hearing constantly

00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:02,829
is is we tried to balance user needs

00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:04,599
internally stakeholders internally with

00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:05,840
what the public was telling us they

00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:07,909
wanted because we also did

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,099
throughout this entire process from the

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,169
from the pre-alpha days to the minute we

00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:13,999
lost and even after we had a form on our

00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,609
website was at the top that left folks

00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:19,219
get feedback anybody and folks gave us

00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:21,169
feedback oh boy did they but it was

00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,820
really helpful most of the time to get

00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,799
that feedback because even the feedback

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,419
that wasn't super helpful was helpful

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,679
because it allowed us if you see enough

00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:28,429
people saying the same things over and

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,200
over again

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,879
you realize even if you don't want to

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,169
hear it you're like okay we need to

00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:35,210
think about that or we need to address

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,909
that or maybe we're not looking at

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,919
things the right way and so but

00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:41,960
balancing all those those considerations

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,369
was was part of what we were trying to

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,369
do the entire time and so like I

00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:48,320
mentioned earlier go ahead well and just

00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:52,450
jumping in real quick that was what

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:57,499
ultimately led to I would say our final

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:59,359
site architecture so we we experimented

00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:03,080
with a lot of different information

00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:06,249
architectures and what what we

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,589
ultimately got was based on feedback

00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:14,659
they were I would say four different

00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:16,759
groups of people that wanted to use the

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,909
site so there were there were people who

00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,919
just wanted to publish the latest news

00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:24,080
the the latest events that were

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,729
happening in the city and and that that

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,649
became one of our our core main sub

00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:33,320
subcategories there were there were

00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:36,609
people that just wanted to talk about

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,509
the operations of the organization so

00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:44,119
kind of getting back to that

00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:47,259
departmental structure that that was the

00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:51,200
operations the boards and commissions

00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:55,669
the the inner workings of our city and

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,979
then finally the the other two are kind

00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:00,200
of information and guides and then

00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:04,580
highlighting our top services so trying

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:07,099
to be very public focused on what what

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,039
do our constituents need what are they

00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:12,540
looking for how how are they interacting

00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:16,770
with our city so

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:20,040
that that turned out to be a very stable

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:22,680
way to structure our content and meet a

00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,600
lot of those needs because what you find

00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,040
in local government and probably in

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,150
other organizations as well is that

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,830
people aren't finding what they're

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,060
looking for especially in a situation

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,560
where it's like okay like if the

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,090
business will just go somewhere else for

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,780
the city there's no other there's no

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,610
where else to go

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,290
so they can't find it they're gonna show

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,540
up or they're gonna call you and they're

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,740
gonna do that constantly and so you find

00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,450
out when folks are calling constantly

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,980
because they can't find something and we

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,330
get you know second deer feedback on

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,460
this stuff you realize okay was a

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,590
problem well the calls are different now

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,810
than they were say a year ago and so

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,190
that's a win the only thing I had the

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,660
slide I've talked about it already is

00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,980
that even though we didn't really

00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,810
necessarily leverage the plug-in

00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,040
repository it's super well away but we

00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,120
don't have ton of plugins I mean I think

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,260
god I don't know what you've done since

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:07,140
I left but but we wait I'm just you know

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,820
plugins but but what but it what was

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,720
nice about it was that it enabled us

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,670
even we only installed a few paragraphs

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,830
some others but what was helpful for us

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,080
was just having the ability to cut down

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,060
on the in-house development time to do

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,410
things that we would want to do heck of

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,970
a lot faster especially given our

00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,290
shifting timelines then would have been

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,380
the case had we been doing something

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,720
different and having one place to go to

00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,550
get those those those plugins opposed to

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,680
you know some sort of free-for-all of

00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,620
plug-in mania that other CMS's may come

00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,810
with and so sort of overall lessons

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,540
learned I mean there a ton of them but I

00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,160
think that really assessing what the

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,170
most important things are figuring out

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,280
who your audience is whether this is

00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,840
again whether you're the city whether

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,670
you're working for you know a business

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,290
of whatever else understanding who your

00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,090
stakeholders are and not just external

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,470
stakeholders but also internal folks as

00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,300
well because of your subject matter

00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,460
experts aren't updating content if

00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,900
they're not engaged in one of the things

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,100
we kept preaching this happened before I

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,430
got there and I've been while I was

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,240
there it's still happening now sure is

00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,670
communicating the stakeholders that if

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,530
you don't own this content people aren't

00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,530
gonna get the information like this

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,210
actually is your job and and over and

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,310
over and part of how we were able to do

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,680
that was and this was a team effort it

00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,390
wasn't just one person was hammering

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,220
home the points constantly two people

00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,639
in-house through we have in-person

00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,079
sessions we sent out emails

00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:28,820
stantly so we're the boy cried wolf but

00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,959
we sent a lot of emails updating folks

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,940
on what was happening even if they

00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,169
didn't seem to care and they did once we

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,479
told them more and more and they saw

00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:39,049
progress happening that was encouraging

00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:41,659
to them by having weaves to be made

00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:44,149
screenshots we did we made I made

00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:45,889
screencasts for people so there were no

00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:47,389
Evillene nobody could say oh I don't

00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:49,099
know how to do this because there were

00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:50,629
eight different ways to do it and then

00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:52,820
we'd sit with them upstairs in our IT

00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:54,799
room at least once a month when we lost

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,299
it was once a week and say alright what

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,459
are your problems literally anything you

00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,959
need how can we help you and then if

00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:01,219
they had a very specific problems one

00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,839
person who's always wants a problem or

00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,429
something like that we schedule time

00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,570
with them to sit down to help them

00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:07,700
figure out their problem so it's very

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,190
hands-on in very labor intensive in a

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,200
way but it needed to be that way for us

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,089
to be able to get the buy-in necessary

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,099
the other thing too is the buy-in from

00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:18,259
above we had a lot of top cover that

00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,729
enabled us to do things like cut 90% of

00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:22,070
the content on the site and keep our

00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:23,869
jobs I recognized that for most people

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:26,149
that's not a thing you can do or may not

00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:28,129
be tenable to do it but still thinking

00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:30,409
about what are the most important things

00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:32,629
like Charles said don't tackle

00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:35,239
everything at once you can't tackle

00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:37,909
integrations and also migrate and also

00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:39,979
upgrade and also redevelop and also like

00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:42,589
prioritize what's important figure out

00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:44,089
what your main goals are sell that case

00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:45,649
to whoever you have to sell it to in

00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:47,899
order to make those things be the things

00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:49,999
you want to focus on and then go in

00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,549
steps and if you can do that it's gonna

00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:54,289
make your life easier

00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:55,459
also recognizing constraints I mean

00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,749
whether there's two tional constraints

00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:59,029
in a turtle just constraints

00:27:56,749 --> 00:28:00,849
departmental constraints and vocalize

00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,229
those things often I feel like in

00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:04,219
situations we like to be the hero so we

00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:05,779
don't want to talk about what the

00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:07,579
problems are or what our constraints are

00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:09,469
but if someone doesn't understand what

00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:10,909
those constraints are they can't even

00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:12,829
insert even in your stakeholders we tell

00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:14,539
them look there are four of us here's

00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:16,459
what were working on so they understood

00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:18,619
what we were up against in trying to

00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:19,940
serve them so that they're you know when

00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:21,469
you didn't respond to their email the

00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,759
next day or something and we were really

00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:24,739
good about that but in cases what we

00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,690
didn't do those things folks understand

00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:31,549
that oh you've got a big job yeah we do

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,579
and the last thing is just sparing the

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:36,859
details I feel like in tech a lot we

00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:38,429
like to over explain things to users and

00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,629
people don't necessarily care about

00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:41,399
new share in the details because we're

00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:42,929
really excited about it and sometimes

00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,240
like I don't know that we used to were a

00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:46,470
Drupal a whole lot in our conversations

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,909
I mean we told them we were changing to

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,259
a new platform we discussed that it was

00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:50,610
Drew Pole but we didn't get into the

00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:52,529
architecture of it we didn't explain

00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,330
about how great at what we we tell them

00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:55,679
what was useful about it but we kept it

00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,080
to a minimum because at the end of the

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,399
day they don't really care about that

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
they wanna know how it works for them

00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,340
what it's gonna do for them and when

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,690
they saw how it worked

00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,399
you're like oh my gosh this is so much

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,080
easier remember we I remember the first

00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:08,940
time we did a session like an actual

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,619
user session on a screen like this in a

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,029
room somewhere everyone's very skeptical

00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:13,259
cuz we talked about this a lot and then

00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:15,059
we showed them how easy it was gonna be

00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,860
to update pages in their life and so if

00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,330
someone said oh my goodness this is

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,980
gonna save me so much time and we're

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,799
just like hah we did it

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:30,360
we're here so sometimes just show rather

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:32,249
than tell ya so I think this this goes

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,749
back to what what Ron was getting at

00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:39,720
where we engaged with our internal users

00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:43,879
a lot as far as what questions they had

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,590
and what challenges they were facing and

00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:49,379
one thing that helped us was developing

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,779
internal documentation in internal

00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:53,999
training materials early getting those

00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:57,210
started right out of the gate because

00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:59,730
then as we had these these questions

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,309
come up we could just fill in where

00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:05,570
where the gaps were and and that

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:11,759
resource has has really helped us with

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:14,850
onboarding new employees at the city we

00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,190
still get questions of well I I would

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,320
like my new employee to have access to

00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,029
edit content on the website it's like

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,690
well they already have it you know they

00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:26,610
they can do it right now and I I have a

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:31,200
easy way to share some initial

00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:33,450
documentation with them and they can run

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,820
through that at their at their own pace

00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,789
and and then we're still there for any

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:42,840
other questions and can fill in that

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:45,179
documentation as we go so that that has

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,000
been great and I encourage any

00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:54,980
organization to be sure that you're

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,650
stiffly updating that that material yeah

00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:00,350
I think we've covered one other thing I

00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,670
thought about to his guidelines so there

00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,070
weren't a whole lot of we didn't have a

00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,140
ton of codified guidelines about like

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,550
everything in terms of what's on loud on

00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,900
this site what's not allowed on the site

00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,090
what permit you know what you can do

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,890
what you can't do at least but it was

00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:15,380
sort of it sort of like articulated but

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,910
it wasn't documented and because we sort

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,810
of decided throughout this process that

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,640
it would be really important to document

00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,050
those things so that when someone asks

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,760
something you can just point back to the

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,560
guy clients and say you know actually

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,750
it's not in the web guidelines or you

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,640
know trying to work on tone and voice as

00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,920
well trying to figure out it's with

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,330
other content things but it's if you can

00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,880
document anything it's going to make

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,290
your job easier later irrespective of

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,180
how you're using the CMS or what you're

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,960
doing with it because you could be

00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,760
consistent about how you apply whatever

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,700
is you're trying to do and everything

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,630
else is kind of covered like I said it's

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,980
really really how it's been really

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,430
really helpful to be part of a wider

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,980
community because it enables us to share

00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,830
stories and and have conversations about

00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,030
like what works best practices rather

00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,020
than industry coming for an in-house

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,320
especially going from an in-house system

00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,640
where it's just like it's us good luck

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,200
having a system that that other people

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,350
are using and deploying in lots of

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,670
different ways well and and and the

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,680
other thing that really helped us was

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,040
looking at other cities who had who had

00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:20,420
used Drupal Boston had just recently

00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:23,810
done a migration the year before we saw

00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:27,470
them at Code for America and it was just

00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:28,970
great to have an example to look at see

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:33,230
what they had done see what had worked

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:35,690
for them see what things like they were

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,880
able to rewrite every piece of content

00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,190
before it went on the site we would have

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,710
loved to have done that but it wasn't

00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:46,580
realistic for us to tackle that but just

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:49,340
hearing those stories and and and the

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,740
other great thing about being in a

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,460
municipal government and being able to

00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:57,380
make all of that open source is that

00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:01,100
anybody can use that work it's it's

00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:03,020
available please use it you know like

00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,430
that and that's a great place to be

00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,970
where

00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:14,530
we can share that both design content

00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:17,590
strategy is anything so post launch site

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,660
traffic's up for the first time folks

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:22,390
are no longer in the clique want to see

00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,460
full site because mobile traffic is the

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,130
majority of the traffic when I mean it

00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:31,420
was somewhere over 50 55 over 50% months

00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:32,800
ago which is great internal search this

00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,540
is actually the things we didn't expect

00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,090
where things like internal search

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,650
dropped like 70 percent and what I mean

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,660
is people were using internal search a

00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,850
ton on the old site try find what they

00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,860
were looking for and not finding it on

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,630
the new site they barely search but they

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,770
get where they want to go and it's that

00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,510
you can tell because they're just like

00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,920
literally it's just one click two clicks

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,300
they get where they're going is before

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,190
they were like four or five levels deep

00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,360
because I saw the site list set up we

00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,710
didn't really want the new sites that go

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,550
more than three layers deep it does

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,780
sometimes we try to minimize that I

00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:04,660
think the exit rate dropped quite a bit

00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,370
um bounce rates dropped dramatically I

00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,570
mean like some absurd number that

00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,889
doesn't even sound like a real number

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,389
and the site gets a decent amount of

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,649
traffic so it's not even like it's site

00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,300
with 20 people on it and you're like oh

00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,740
well doesn't really mean anything the

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,570
numbers that we're changing we're big of

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,340
course to be fair you could take the

00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,540
entire city website down only put the

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,500
animal shelter up and we probably see

00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:25,300
meta traffic to be fair but like it's by

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,919
far it comes to anything else on the

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,050
site by far as like there's the animal

00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,790
shelter and everything else even the

00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,879
homepage and even and that was another

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:36,129
lesson that we learned a lot of people

00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,310
in our in our city they want their

00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:41,440
content on the home page but it it

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,899
doesn't really matter that's that's not

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,649
what's driving people to their specific

00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:50,350
content it needs to be well written

00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:53,050
Google is is going to drive people to

00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:55,030
that content and I think our animal

00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,310
shelter is is proof of that it gets more

00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,810
traffic than our home page itself so

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,130
it's not off the front page so you can't

00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,780
go straight at my shelter you've got to

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,970
get it right yeah on the front page

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,290
should be should be just dogs on the

00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,210
front page and I think it's just cats

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,020
and rabbits we've a bit rabbit town I

00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,940
don't really get it

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:16,630
so some resources you can check out yeah

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:19,500
we like I said we do have all of our

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,060
rupal modules are on our github page

00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,010
we're happy to talk about what we've

00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:27,640
done and share share anything that we've

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:30,640
done we have we have a number of those

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,830
other third-party or separate systems

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,190
from Drupal that we've created we have a

00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:39,490
custom boards and committee membership

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:43,780
tracking system that we use to track our

00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:46,240
meeting minutes and agendas and packets

00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,640
and we've integrated that with our

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,850
Drupal instance we've had success

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:56,110
integrating Google Calendar with Drupal

00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:58,920
so that our calendar and events listings

00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:01,870
are driven by the Google calendars that

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,940
city staff are actually using to track

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:08,980
their meeting meeting events like Ron

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:13,150
mentioned we have we use an open-source

00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:16,570
software for our animal shelter animal

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:20,080
shelter manager and we we wrote a Drupal

00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:22,210
module to pull the animals that are up

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:28,570
for adoption and be able to show those

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:30,370
in real time on our Drupal site so a lot

00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:33,490
of good resources there and we'd be

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:38,380
happy to collaborate with anybody on

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:40,120
that so yeah that's it ask lots of

00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,760
questions or anyway thanks for your time

00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:46,680
thank you all

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,680
[Applause]

00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,680
yes

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:09,590
so the question is do we have any

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:12,770
workflow or review now that we have a

00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:17,080
new workflow for reviewing content

00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:22,220
before it goes live and the answer is no

00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:25,940
we we have people who work for the city

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:28,460
and we have the public and if anything

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,500
goes up that shouldn't go up we have

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,770
that revision history and we can go back

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,230
and have that conversation but like I

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,660
said we've had more of a challenge

00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:43,430
getting people to make those edits than

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:45,590
we have so far knock on wood we haven't

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:49,640
had anything go up that shouldn't have

00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:52,850
been up so that hasn't proved to be an

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,560
actual issue that was true on the old

00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,820
site too you could just edit there's

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,850
almost in your department you get it at

00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,530
the content the same way so that might

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,210
help the status quo is kind of it's kind

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,530
of the same now use edit anything but

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,530
people don't want to do extra work

00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,480
yeah that's our the the question just

00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,580
for the recording is by opening up

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,190
access did we notice the number of

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,070
people who were making edits go up or

00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:34,480
down yeah I would I would definitely say

00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:36,430
that the number has gone up that was

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,780
even pre-launch so like pre-launch we

00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,120
train some folks who are more active

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,680
went to departments and said hey you can

00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,600
get a jump on this put some content in

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,610
the site and they took us up on it and

00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,510
started adding content months before we

00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,310
launched the site which was really

00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,800
helpful for us of course because you

00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,690
know we were at capacity but yet by far

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,040
compared to the old site on the old site

00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,050
there may have been a dozen people at

00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,780
any given time during the year who were

00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:02,230
regular regular users of the site that

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,790
numbers surely tripled by now the other

00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,650
the other thing I would add to that is I

00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:09,040
think migrating to a system like Drupal

00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:13,390
that is more user friendly than our our

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,370
previous system what we saw on our old

00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,410
site was that most departments would

00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:20,470
delegate updating content to their

00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:24,280
interns and so the interns would be kind

00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:26,290
of the primary voice of our city and and

00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,670
and then they would leave like an intern

00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,850
is not going to stick around very long

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:33,010
so kind of lowering that barrier to

00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:37,990
entry having something that's a little

00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:39,880
bit more user friendly we're seeing

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:45,210
better engagement and more more people

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,210
are making those edits thank you

00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:12,530
so how did we create an open engaging

00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:17,430
environment to supporting our customers

00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:23,040
without mansplaining about their about

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:24,780
the content or the process I think that

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,280
honestly I think it starts on the top in

00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,870
that department it's just in general

00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,340
that's just the way the structure

00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,310
department is it's very customer focused

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:35,070
and customer of customer centric and and

00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,170
so I think that that probably helped a

00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,670
lot so the report was already there

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,140
suppose this wasn't an onboarding

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,850
process hey we're new we're talking to

00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,160
you as more these are ongoing customers

00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,570
it's not a very big city so you know

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,070
we're not we dealing with tens of people

00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,790
rather than thousands of hundreds of

00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:54,090
people which probably helped some - yeah

00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:55,920
I would add that just being focused on

00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,680
customer service and in our case that

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,770
our customers our internal employees

00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:07,020
other staff in the city and in trying to

00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:09,960
help them help us and and and be on the

00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,300
same team and listen to what their what

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,590
their questions are yeah like not being

00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,820
condescending or a rude or I mean I

00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,290
think I think being a local government

00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,970
probably lends itself to different than

00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,220
other organizations where you have more

00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,510
of an education process or of trying to

00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,750
educate people on these kinds of things

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:30,180
but I think that it's a it's an ongoing

00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,400
process right of creating a culture and

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,660
a climate that is supportive of of

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,920
everyone and meet people where they're

00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,270
at I think that's it right

00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,980
like you're not assuming people should

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,270
know something folks come to us often

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,740
you know everyone you working in tech

00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,210
has heard someone say oh I don't know

00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,550
this really well or I'm dumb and it's

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,600
like no you're not you you're confident

00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,040
you know what you're doing let's just

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,860
figure this out or let's make this more

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,430
accessible and Ron also hinted like we

00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:57,240
didn't go into a lot of Drupal specific

00:41:53,430 --> 00:42:02,280
jargon we we tried to keep it very high

00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,540
level and just non non-technical no one

00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,610
knows we didn't know it is in our

00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,040
organization and and instill the site

00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,700
still works like it's great huh you had

00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,590
a question in the back

00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,590
oh yeah yes

00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:29,579
so the question so the question was is

00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,839
is talked more about our that's where

00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,239
the user experience research that went

00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:37,289
into the process and whatever else and

00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:38,700
so well again we didn't we we did

00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:40,109
several things obviously using analyst

00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,759
was very helpful for us in terms of just

00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:44,670
being able to figure out like to sort of

00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:46,230
map a flow of where people are going

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,700
we did some in-person stuff as well

00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,230
talking we had some students work

00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,079
working with some students at the

00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:54,119
University to talk to some end to end

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,039
users just stakeholders that we had no

00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,619
idea who they were to find out how they

00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,489
use the site and that was more at the

00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:04,499
design stage yeah we we had mock-ups and

00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:07,200
we engaged with our local University had

00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:10,529
had a great intern helping us with some

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,960
of those design elements and then taking

00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:15,480
those out to two people and then the

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,180
other thing was the the Google form of

00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,509
survey that we had up on our alpha site

00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,779
so we we were able to put put the

00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:28,079
website up before it was ready and

00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:31,049
solicit public feedback and we would do

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,869
press releases encouraging the public to

00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:36,390
come to that alpha site take a look

00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:38,549
use use just a simple google form to

00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,559
give us that feedback of of anything

00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:42,269
that they thought that's probably the

00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,920
biggest thing in terms of actual user

00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:45,960
research that we did was getting that

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,819
feedback in a net and that form was up

00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,730
the entire time so every iteration of

00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:52,769
the Alpha you saw that form on the site

00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,089
so people folks who are developers off

00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:55,920
and we were right back and be like this

00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:58,160
is the worst I've ever seen in my life I

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,539
built better slice this in my sleep

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,190
we never did want to write back and say

00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:06,150
you can come help us but we never did

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,349
that but we wanted to so yeah so that

00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,299
that was probably the biggest thing that

00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:10,710
we did a lot of other anecdotal smaller

00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:12,329
things that we would do just to get some

00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:15,210
snapshots but might be more on the

00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:17,130
design research side than we did on the

00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:22,549
other than the survey on the UX side of

00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:22,549
it just because of a capacity yes

00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:54,960
sure perfectly sure so as part of that

00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,550
wanting to expand Drupal the use of

00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:10,440
Drupal outside of your specific

00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:13,770
department or okay sure

00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,800
so that was that was an area that we had

00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:19,890
concern using Drupal for because we

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:23,000
didn't want it to bog down the system

00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:25,770
with a lot of manually updated

00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,800
information and and boardin committee

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:31,230
members are changing all at the time our

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,780
city staff liaison for those boards and

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:37,890
commissions are changing as employees

00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:40,560
come and go and we were more comfortable

00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:45,030
developing a separate system we call it

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,430
on board and that's that's a PHP

00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:49,020
application that we wrote that's that's

00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:53,099
open source and available on our github

00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:57,510
and we do have a Drupal module that

00:45:53,099 --> 00:46:00,180
integrates with that system so we

00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,310
decided to opt for a kind of a separate

00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:07,500
system that would handle managing those

00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:12,869
documents in tying those together with

00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:15,359
the corresponding meeting dates so that

00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:18,200
was ultimately what what we decided to

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:23,030
do was kind of keep that separate system

00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,030
thank you back

00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,190
[Music]

00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:05,050
well so as far as are you talking

00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:25,480
information architecture or are like

00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:29,830
more of a lower level system we didn't

00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:32,770
use anything like that again our our

00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:35,800
content is rather open as far as who can

00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:38,140
edit it but I one thing that we didn't

00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:42,340
touch on that that was very useful is

00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:46,210
that our use of aliases URL aliases so

00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:50,200
trying to topically group content under

00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:54,120
under a subdirectory effectively I mean

00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,770
it's it's not really a subdirectory but

00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,810
grouping that similar content under

00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:04,060
under those URLs and making sure that

00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:06,370
everything has a good named route for

00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:09,310
that alias I'm not sure if that's

00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:11,140
exactly so we didn't yeah we didn't

00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,280
separate the contents actually so some

00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,240
of the some of the applications like the

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,370
animal shelter is a separate application

00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,890
entirely and the content gets pulled

00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:20,170
into Drupal and Charleston speak to that

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,610
and so others we have other things like

00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,630
that board commission is the same thing

00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,310
it's a separate application the

00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,160
application the content gets pulled into

00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:29,830
our Drupal instance but the actual

00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,900
content for Drupal is just like actual

00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,580
City Hall content and its socialist the

00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,290
content people can edit but those aren't

00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,700
separate icons suffered by Department so

00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,200
we didn't separate it by Department

00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,320
books the only focus that could access

00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,660
their content they can access anything

00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,040
which is unusual but in ours in our case

00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,990
it made sense because we have so many

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,630
things that are shared that if we didn't

00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,260
do that what happened is you have

00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,180
redundant content for different

00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,619
departments on the site because folks be

00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,839
like well I have to have my version of

00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:58,810
this page on the site so we chose not to

00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:04,890
do that on the separate by to silent out

00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:04,890
some folks can't edit things thank you

00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:10,109
anything else yes

00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:39,820
because we're working in a smaller city

00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:43,750
right sure yeah right so the question is

00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:45,040
how was working on a site for a city the

00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,870
size of Bloomington different than

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,420
working for either a bigger city like

00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:52,690
Boston or even a smaller city and I

00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:55,870
think the answer to that is that most

00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:57,700
cities have similar services that they

00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:00,490
have to offer and regardless of what

00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:02,950
size they are I think the only

00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:04,540
difference comes in the amount of

00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,120
resources that they have the amount of

00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,970
people that they have dedicated to doing

00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,910
a specific task so the smaller the city

00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:15,670
I think generally the the fewer people

00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,890
that you have working on that specific

00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:20,370
task or the more hats that people have

00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:23,560
to wear so the more that you can

00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:26,770
leverage something that's kind of

00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:30,240
already been done and solved I think the

00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:32,890
better the better you are also just

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,620
interference so somebody who went from

00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:37,780
like really small places to state

00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,070
government to local and now a federal

00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,570
work what's interesting is that the

00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,280
amount of people who are interpreting in

00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,710
the interference in terms of what you're

00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,810
trying to do and so police it was sort

00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,280
of like almost just the right size I

00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,720
mean there's obviously some interference

00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,360
because you just have levels of whatever

00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,830
but it's not so much that like you can

00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,300
get to anybody you need to talk to is

00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,590
right you can go talk to them you don't

00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,880
need to get me get appointments to go

00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,960
talk to somebody for the most part you

00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,170
can just go hey have a five-minute

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,640
conversation and solve problems in a

00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,560
smaller place I think you'd have more of

00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,850
that in a bigger place you'd have a lot

00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,060
less of that just because of the

00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:11,560
constraints involved but I think that

00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,260
it's the right size in terms of

00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,520
resources and access but not you know

00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,660
not so little that you can't get

00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,540
anything done or you're just like we

00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,310
can't do anything but not so big that it

00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,990
gets to be unwieldy or you have a lot of

00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,990
a lot of sort of hands in the pot

00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:39,359
yes and this one in the two yet so the

00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:40,589
when we go so the question was is 90% of

00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,910
the content we dropped we've still

00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:43,800
maintaining it in house how do you do

00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:46,170
that the old site is still accessible

00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,910
internally only and we did that because

00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,650
obviously when in folks folks if they

00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:51,540
are gonna migrate it later and I mean

00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:52,650
it's been almost a year now at the time

00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,900
we're like well if you want to migrate

00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,859
it later and you will in most cases you

00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,150
want to be able to access that content

00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:59,819
and then be able to pull it over to the

00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:01,319
new site or clean it up and so we allow

00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:06,359
people to do that and so they still

00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:09,930
could access it from internally yeah and

00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:12,960
that goes along with during the actual

00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:15,630
site migration one one of the issues

00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,579
that we were having and it could be

00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,700
because we had cried wolf so many times

00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:22,109
and in and said that oh yes the site is

00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,760
launching but one of the issues that we

00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:26,069
were having was getting people to

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,460
actually do we help us with that content

00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:31,770
migration and this was a way that we

00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,470
could launch with kind of that core

00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:38,220
content but still maintain the old

00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:40,049
system internally so that if there was

00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,109
something that we missed that truly

00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:45,809
needed to be on the new site employees

00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:48,000
would still have access to it but we

00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:50,160
wanted to make sure that that's internal

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,260
only because we don't want to confuse

00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,829
the public or still have those old links

00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:58,349
out there and and have people stumbling

00:52:55,829 --> 00:53:00,059
across that old content also we created

00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:01,859
redirects for every one of the old pages

00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:04,020
redirects for every one of the old pages

00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:06,420
on the on Google so you didn't you know

00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,619
so so yeah that was that was that was a

00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,490
yeoman's effort for sure

00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:10,490
we had one question

00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:35,740
of course everybody s yes so the

00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,240
question is what you know okay working

00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,890
at a university and trying to build by

00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,740
and how do you get buy-in to be able to

00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:43,270
cut content from the site so having been

00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,820
in the university bucket I can tell you

00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:47,140
that well for us just answer the

00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:50,020
question and then I'll speak more

00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,670
specifically um I think that for us it

00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,320
was several things one it was what ended

00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:56,020
being time based I feel like I mean you

00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:59,170
speak to it I would say that the biggest

00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:01,930
thing that got us buy-in was the

00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:05,589
frustration that everybody had in using

00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:06,790
the old site both internally and and

00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:10,359
feedback that we would get from the

00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:12,700
public saying that they just had a hard

00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:14,530
time using the site and the main reason

00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,119
that they had a hard time using the site

00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:19,060
was because there was too much content

00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:21,040
too much stale content out outdated

00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,520
content so of course it's going to be

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,670
difficult to to find what you're looking

00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:30,280
for if if the content is a mess and the

00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:33,910
only way you can really solve that is by

00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:38,010
doing some serious house housekeeping so

00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:40,720
that gave us buy-in like our mayor and

00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:42,700
directors knew knew that this was an

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,420
issue they had they had received these

00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,160
complaints from the public before so

00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,869
they knew it was a problem and the

00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,070
numbers I guess yeah you reminded me the

00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,630
last the other thing is the numbers

00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:55,030
using the Analects was a very powerful

00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:57,010
way to even two departments to say look

00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:59,670
eight people have been to this page in

00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:02,020
two years I know cuz I ran the numbers

00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:04,359
and then they'd look at you and go oh

00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:06,670
okay okay I guess I can tie that with

00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:07,930
some other page yeah maybe we can and so

00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,570
I think that that's a really powerful

00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,859
way to just show people that it's not

00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,210
always that it's not important and it's

00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:15,490
not being dismissive right it's just

00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,810
like how can we consolidate this or how

00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:17,830
can we make this in a way that people

00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,510
are going to find it do we need to move

00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:21,250
it up do we need to change it there are

00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:24,070
some situations occasionally where folks

00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:26,110
had content that may have only had 25

00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,370
views over a year

00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,720
for whatever reason it was neither in

00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:30,790
the wrong place or it was really

00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,500
important content but you know we didn't

00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,180
know why it forms on it or something

00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,180
like that so we need to dredge it up so

00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,650
those are situations exist but 80% of

00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,570
the time they're just pages that people

00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:42,250
forgot about or need to be ignored so I

00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,900
think having the data as you're at your

00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,910
disposal is really helpful and also

00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,470
talking about figuring out what people

00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:50,560
are looking for is a really good way to

00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:52,030
do that I think we're at time so leave

00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,620
my questions we'll be around feel free

00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:56,150
to ping us we appreciate you very much

00:55:53,620 --> 00:56:01,300
thanks for coming yes thank you

00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:01,300
