Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Nurturing a Productive Lifestyle
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Do you ever reach the end of your day and wonder what you actually accomplished? Even worse - do you have weeks where you feel like you didnâ€™t get anything done at all? This is a story about overcoming bad habits and getting shit done.

There's the Ivy Lee Method, 80/20 principle, and a laundry list of other lifehacks that all work... for awhile. Change happens. Rather than focusing on a single solution, we'll discuss how to nurture a productive lifestyle to help you roll with the punches. We'll learn how to bounce back from failure and feel good about the work we do.

Key takeaway: "It is within my means to become happier and more productive by thinking differently about myself and the work that I do. As a result, I will be a calmer, more reliable person."

check one two three check one two three

00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:03,559
all right thank you very much okay

00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,559
thanks

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,090
alright well let's go ahead an get

00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,430
started so welcome everyone to nurturing

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:26,500
a productive lifestyle now if you guys

00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:30,680
are anything like me in terms of your

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,290
workday it's not uncommon to sort of

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,930
reach the end of your workday and look

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,530
back and think man what did I actually

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,720
get done today

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,820
it's anything like me I can name like a

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,430
meeting or two that I went to but what

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,440
did I actually accomplish what what

00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,090
goals did I meet what important things

00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,600
that I started to do did I actually do

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,460
and so that's when I when I noticed that

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,900
that's when I started looking at

00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,880
different productivity techniques

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,229
different things that I could do to

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,070
change the way that I think about my

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,530
workday in order to sort of lifehack to

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,709
improve myself to improve my performance

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:13,010
and so that's when I started researching

00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,959
productivity and proposing sessions like

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,660
this so I could have talks with people

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,510
about productivity so let me start by

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,400
introducing myself my name is David Nina

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,290
I'm the developer advocate at Pantheon

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,700
the thing I love about working as a

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,920
developer advocate at Pantheon is that

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,200
my job goes two ways I get to be the

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,090
advocate for our developers to other

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,920
people at Pantheon but I also get to

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,019
take everything that I know as an

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,390
employee of Pantheon and share it with

00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,040
developers as well so I get to spend a

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,840
lot of they just sharing everything I

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,800
can to help the developer experience be

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,970
as smooth and easy as possible so I want

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,160
to start by sort of dispelling something

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,840
a little bit so first of all I'm gonna

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,570
be going through a number of different

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,790
productivity techniques today I'm gonna

00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,519
be talking through the benefits of them

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,720
and how to use them effectively but I

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,850
want to start just by telling you that

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,310
there is really no like

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,519
one-size-fits-all solution there's no

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,320
silver bullet there's no diet pill of

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,380
productivity that's going to fix all

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,430
your problems and so what this means is

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,610
that it's really important that you

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,910
start by thinking about this as building

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,950
your own productivity strategy you know

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,520
yourself better than anyone else most

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,840
likely and so it's up to you to

00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,120
think about the techniques that I'm

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,740
talking about today if you go out and

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,930
read in research think about those

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,150
productivity techniques think about how

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,620
they apply to you what they sort of

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,690
tweak in your brain about how you think

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,720
about things and then personalize it

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,310
make it your own change it into

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,580
something that will be even more

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:53,900
effective for you so for some people

00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:56,330
this might mean being very strict with

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,370
yourself about certain limitations or

00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,950
rules you know maybe you have to have a

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,120
reward for accomplishing whatever thing

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,040
you're setting out to do

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,780
maybe that motivates you for other

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,000
people maybe you need a certain level of

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,180
accountability maybe you need to involve

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,130
people in your process so that you can

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,890
be accountable to them or maybe you need

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,630
a little bit of public accountability

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,040
personally I've been blogging about my

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,280
processes that go through productivity

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,210
and so I have sort of the public

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:30,920
whomever reads my blog to keep me in

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,970
check so as part of this also when

00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,500
you're personalizing you're kind of

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,720
taking these plans building something

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,040
that works for yourself it's also

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,530
important to note that you will change

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,540
over time no technique no matter how

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,240
perfect it is at any given point will

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,190
work forever because we all change quite

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,690
a bit you know whether it's a small

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,580
change or maybe you complete a project

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,860
and about to start a new project or

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,430
maybe it's a big change where you get

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,260
married or have a kid or start a new job

00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,050
regardless we change and therefore we

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,860
need to be prepared to keep our plan

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,110
flexible and make changes along the way

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,660
related to that no one plan is going to

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,790
work forever and we need to prepare for

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,380
when that when that planet actually

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,140
stops working we need to have some sort

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,480
of a contingency we need to plan for

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,060
that expect it and have other things in

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,190
mind to really end up growing the plan

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,530
to make it better with all the things

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,600
you've learned so far and growing is

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,430
also true as you learn new techniques

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,890
you know maybe you hear this technique

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,320
one of the techniques you like today and

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,830
you go and listen to another talk maybe

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,440
tomorrow

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,780
and you learn you pick something else up

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,090
and so you can adapt and grow and make

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,100
the

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,139
as because it needs to be alright so

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,350
with this in mind of growing your own

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,180
plan or building your own plan let me

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,300
start with the first technique so the

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,600
first technique is the Ivy Lee method so

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,750
Ivy Lee was a rather dapper gentleman

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,210
who lived in the late 1800s Early 1900s

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,570
he was known in his time as a

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,210
Productivity expert and he really became

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:12,900
known as the father of modern public

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:14,630
relations so as part of his experience

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,000
he became well-known in this industry

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,910
and was approached by a gentleman named

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,220
Charles Schwab Charles Schwab is not the

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,810
sort of financial guru that we all know

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,440
as Charles Schwab today this was another

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,330
gentleman but he was very wealthy he was

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,610
running a company that'll ahem steel

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,120
corporation which at the time was the

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,250
number-two largest steel organization in

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,820
the entire world they were making knight

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:45,240
Navy ships and all those things and so

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,550
Schwab approached mr. Lee and said I

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,890
want you to improve our team's

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,110
productivity I want you I want to be

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,050
able to do more in our day for all of

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,750
our executives and you know I believe

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,820
says ok no problem just give me 15

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,490
minutes with each one of your executives

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,050
and I guarantee that I can improve their

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,910
productivity okay so mr. Schwab being

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,250
the shrewd businessman that he was says

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,260
ok well how much are you gonna charge me

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,490
for this fifteen minutes of time for a

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,650
person I be Lee said nothing you don't

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,419
have to pay me anything unless it

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,580
actually works unless it's valuable to

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:28,169
you and then you can pay me whatever you

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:30,720
want ok let that sink in for me I don't

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:32,490
know it where you guys are all at but if

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,919
there's any freelancers out there sales

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,510
guys have has anyone ever said yeah I'll

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,070
do this project for you just pay me

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,490
whatever you want at the end how great

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,430
would that be

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,110
right yeah so obviously Ivy Lee had a

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,270
lot of faith that his technique was

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,780
going to work so what was this

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,280
breakthrough secret strategy it's

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,280
actually pretty simple

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:58,170
you start just by writing down six

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,940
things so you make this list the

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,270
specifics of specifics of this list is

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,380
just an example so you don't need to

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,520
spend too much time in it but this is an

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,860
example of some of the things that have

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,419
been on my list in the past so you just

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,760
write down six things at the end of your

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,930
workday you think about the things that

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,600
are important that you need to do

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,120
tomorrow you add them to your list you

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,190
then prioritize the list you put them in

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,220
the order of greatest importance or

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,720
greatest time sensitivity you know if

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:30,270
you have a particular deadline that you

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,980
need to do things by you prioritize your

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,930
list so that you really focus on the

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,280
first thing so as you go throughout your

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,930
day you know the next day you come into

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,870
work you look at your list you look at

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,180
number one and you concentrate on it you

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,690
focus on it you do nothing but the first

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:51,390
one until it's done or until you have to

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:53,100
move on to the next thing now I realize

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,250
that this can be really difficult like

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,980
we tend to want to do multiple things at

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,870
the same time we want to spend time on

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,550
I'm gonna check my email here and there

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,050
or I'm going to you know have this show

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,800
running in the background or I'm going

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,530
to listen to this TED talk or this no

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,210
previous Drupal event talk or whatever

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,670
but you know science has proven at this

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,089
point that we are really really bad at

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,050
multitasking even if we feel like we are

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,850
even if we think that we're the best

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,180
person at multitasking we're really bad

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,030
at it

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,180
so the third part here is just

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,770
concentrating you know if you can new to

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,470
your slack for an hour or however long

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,810
it needs to be if you can put your email

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,860
away turn off notifications just focus

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,480
on the one task once you've completed

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,860
this task you move on to the next one

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,790
and you do the same and you go

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,530
throughout your day that way once you've

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,610
reached the end of your day you might

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,339
have some things that are left over

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,860
that's okay you take those things and

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,270
you move it to the next day's list and

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,650
you know that thing if it's not

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,140
important like cleaning my desk is

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,450
probably not super important to my daily

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,709
job so it might end up at the bottom of

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,889
the list again and maybe it doesn't get

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,109
done again and that's that's a

00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:06,689
okay but the point is were focusing on

00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:09,970
the things that are most important to us

00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:12,489
we're prioritizing them we're focusing

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,559
on them and at the end of the day even

00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:16,569
if you only get the first thing done you

00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,749
still got the most important thing that

00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:24,910
you could do with your day which is

00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:26,949
still pretty awesome so personally I

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,259
tried this out I felt like it was

00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:31,029
extremely effective for me here are some

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:35,259
reasons why first of all it's very

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,910
simple I don't have to go through some

00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:39,519
complicated process all that I need to

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,689
do is spend five ten fifteen minutes at

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,850
the end of my day coming up with the

00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:44,319
list and then it's usually pretty easy

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,899
at that point to prioritize that list

00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:49,619
the hardest part is really focusing on

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:51,879
just that one thing throughout the day

00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:54,279
the next thing is that it really forces

00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,259
you to think critically about each thing

00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,029
that you're doing when you're coming up

00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,249
that list when you're prioritizing you

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,480
need to think about your day how often

00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:03,160
do you think about the things you're

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,449
doing tomorrow and actually give them

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,600
some sort of rank or some sort of

00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:09,009
priority I don't do it very often if I'm

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
not doing it in the technique like this

00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:15,189
so it really forces you to think and

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,449
plan for what you're doing tomorrow and

00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,790
so there's also been a lot of research

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,739
on removing friction and how that can

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,569
improve our likelihood to actually

00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:24,399
follow through and do something you know

00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:27,189
some people would even say like in some

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,999
of the studies is like if my goal is to

00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:33,309
go work out every morning at 7 a.m. then

00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:35,709
I should remove as much friction as

00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,809
possible to make that happen for some

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,009
people that might be instead of setting

00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,269
out their clothes and kind of setting

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,309
out you know what they're gonna wear the

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,809
next day set out your gym clothes you

00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,639
know put those on your bed or at the end

00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,169
or on your dresser or whatever or some

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,910
people might even take that too a little

00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,110
bit an extreme and actually go to bed in

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,360
your gym clothes so that when you wake

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,970
up okay I'm ready to go I'm gonna go to

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,189
the gym or whatever works for you the

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,720
Ivy Lee method here removes the friction

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:00,189
to start with your day because you've

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
already thought about the things that

00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:03,189
are important for today you've already

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,929
prepared them you already have a list

00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,480
and all you have to do is look at the

00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:09,279
first one and go you can hit the ground

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,389
running and do the thing that's most

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,339
important and lastly and this is really

00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,450
the most important and the thing that's

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,420
the hardest for me

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,250
is actually focusing it requires you to

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,890
focus on that one task as much as

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,110
possible now a few things that you

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,210
should be aware of is well first of all

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,010
this allows you or enables you to really

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,830
be proactive with your day instead of

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,450
reactive it allows you to think about

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,820
what's happening tomorrow prepare for it

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,740
and have a plan in place instead of just

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,670
having to react to oh I have a meeting

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,950
in five minutes

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,870
I forgot the slides or I forgot to look

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,730
up who I'm talking to or whatever it is

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,180
it gives you a chance to really be

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,440
proactive so in order to really make

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,790
this work there's a few things I've

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,770
discovered as I went through and

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,070
actually tried to do this and first of

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,330
all you need to be mindful of deadlines

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:03,490
the first time I went through the Ivy

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:04,840
Lee method I created my list I defined

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,090
something that was relatively

00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,820
unimportant like it wasn't at the top of

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,650
my list but it had a deadline and I

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,120
reached the end of my workday or I

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,590
reached the time when that meeting was

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,210
or you know when that thing was coming

00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,550
up and I realized I hadn't actually

00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:21,070
gotten to that thing and so even though

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,410
that task that particular thing was not

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,330
all that important it needed to be

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,430
higher on my list so that I was able to

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,350
actually get to that in my day so being

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,710
mindful of deadlines will help you think

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,930
about those things it's also important

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,060
to try to break down large tasks so you

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,950
might be thinking of okay I have this

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,050
project Ivy Lee isn't gonna possibly

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,470
work for me because I have this big

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,570
chunky thing that I need to do I can't

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,890
come up with six things or a problem

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,740
that I had went again one of the first

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,630
times that I did it was that I had a big

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,820
chunky task as my number one most

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,470
important thing and I didn't even finish

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,850
that in my day which means I got to my

00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,980
the end of my list at the end of my work

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,720
day and I really didn't I got some stuff

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,520
done the progress but I didn't get

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,890
anything on my list checked off which

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,600
didn't feel super good so some

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,610
strategies here to break down large

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,800
tasks is you might let's say for example

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,860
you have a blog post that you need to

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,650
write so you can break that down into

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,950
I'm going to write the outline I'm going

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,420
to actually draft the post maybe I will

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,820
meet with a co-worker to get them to

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,340
review it then I'll spend time

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,660
publishing marketing on stuff or if it's

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,010
something that truly can't be broken

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,950
down into any more

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,330
granular parts then you can say okay I'm

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,580
going to put the number one thing on my

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,190
list I'm going to spend one hour on this

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,020
task so for example again if that blog

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,210
post is coming up or something a big

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,430
project and it's coming up in two weeks

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,260
I could say okay I'm gonna spend one

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,820
hour today and then focus on other

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,530
things that are important today tomorrow

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,880
maybe I spent two hours on it and then

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,010
focus on other things that are important

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,230
and then by the time that deadline comes

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,360
up you will have worked on it a number

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,700
of times and it will accumulate and then

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,430
you can maybe break down some more

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,960
granular things but it's really

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,430
important here that we we take this

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,500
seriously it for any productivity

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,660
technique this is true in order for us

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,610
to are in order for it to be really

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,700
effective we need to actually take it

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,870
seriously follow it if it is important

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,530
to us then it's something that we need

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,150
to follow through um one of the things

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,150
that I have problems with on this is

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,070
that I travel a lot I travel about once

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:30,430
a month to go to conferences or meetings

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,650
or things like that and so I returned

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,510
from a trip and I have this big queue of

00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,070
work that I need to do we'll probably

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,730
have this when we return from DrupalCon

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:43,210
this week and I it's easy to fall into a

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:45,220
trap of okay I have too much work that I

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,390
need to work on to actually go through

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,080
the Ivy League method today maybe I'll

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,060
do it tomorrow

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,590
I really need to focus on this project

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,360
or check my email or I need to do this

00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,730
thing I don't have time to make my list

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,830
of six things for tomorrow it's an easy

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,940
trap to get into like I said I still

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,490
struggle with it quite a bit

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,560
but it it's not true it's false you even

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,300
spend fifteen minutes doing your

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,760
productivity thing whatever that is and

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,230
it will save you lots and lots of time

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,650
throughout the week it's it's worth

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,900
taking seriously so then at the end of

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,550
the day some things that I do to help

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,710
Ivy Lee method a little bit of

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,210
housekeeping is checking to see if I

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,280
actually did do the six things that I

00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:25,030
set out to do I'll check my list and you

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,350
know see where I'm at I also take time

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,670
to actually make my list for tomorrow

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,090
where the most important things for me

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,920
to do tomorrow and then I ask myself did

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,490
I actually ask add these into my task

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,410
list so there's a number of different

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,820
task lists you might use maybe you have

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:44,290
a team that has

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:47,020
a project management software JIRA or

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,670
asana or who knows could be anything or

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,680
maybe you have your own personal task

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,870
list that you you keep on your computer

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,480
or maybe you prefer a notebook with

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,760
paper whatever works for you it's

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,350
important to kind of use a method that

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,420
works so one of the the pieces of

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,860
software that I've heard about I haven't

00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,140
had a chance to use it effectively but

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,540
it seems like it's really good for

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,120
something like Ivy Lee it's called to do

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:18,280
and it's it it's a little small a little

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:20,860
hard to see but it's felt te u te UX de

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,959
UX and the thing that's really cool

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,060
about to do is it gives you this short

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,740
list where you can pick things you can

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,870
create your list of six things if you're

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,070
doing Ivy Lee and then you can cross

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,040
them off as you go throughout the day

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,540
and then at the bottom you actually have

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,610
a list of categories and so you could

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,780
have like your your backlog of things

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,460
you need to do or the things that are

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,560
important to you that maybe don't make

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,780
it onto the list or I have a list of

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,840
blog post ideas and then as you're

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,130
creating your list each day it's not up

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,900
to you to remember like oh what was that

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,490
thing I needed to do yesterday you can

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,130
just grab something from your list on

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,540
the bottom pull it up to the next day or

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,820
you can grab something as a due date

00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,130
pull it up to the next day and then

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,850
you're ready to go and it's creating the

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,980
list for you some of the things that you

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,990
can add to this list is some personal

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,730
improvement tasks things that are maybe

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,500
not work-related but are still important

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,940
to you or that help you to feel more

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,720
productive or efficient so one of them

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,490
for me is inbox zero who here gets zero

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,050
emails in their inbox or gets down to

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,530
zero emails in their inbox every day wow

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,030
that's impressive

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,040
III have a really hard time with this

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,690
there is a technique I have learned that

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,130
makes this a lot easier I'd be able to

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,200
talk to you guys about that at the end

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,550
if we have time for it but this is

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,720
something I said not to do it makes me

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,950
feel good to know that I'm being

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,170
organized with my inbox have I tweeted a

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,330
helpful resource today so this is one

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,220
where I go through periods of time where

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,600
I'm not using social media very well and

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,260
I in order to like be a contributor to

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,850
creating content

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,930
and kind of promote my personal brand I

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,630
think it's important to tweet something

00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,950
that's helpful or encouraging and so I

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,640
just have a personal improvement to

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,720
remind myself of this another thing that

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,910
I like to add to my personal

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,960
improvements list is have I actually

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,910
looked at my schedule for tomorrow

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,830
because even if I'm creating my Ivy Lee

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,630
list sometimes I forget to look at the

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,850
actual meetings that I'm doing or the

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,620
things that I'm doing after work or the

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,730
things that my daughter or son might be

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,510
doing with school or other projects

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,670
another thing that's important to me

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,410
that I put on my list is reading my

00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,480
Bible and praying I'm a Christian so

00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,070
it's important to me I feel like it's

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,220
something that helps me to prepare for

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,600
my day and to really mentally be in the

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,480
place I need to be to be an effective

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,490
employee and husband and father and all

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,100
that stuff maybe for you if this isn't

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,100
your thing maybe it's reading some book

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,470
or maybe it's meditation or yoga or

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,910
something else but the point is really

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:52,960
focusing on things that are important to

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:54,910
you another thing that's important to me

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,530
is a little bit of physical fitness so I

00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:59,350
don't I'm not the sort of person who

00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,760
really goes to the gym but I work from

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,950
home and it's pretty easy low friction

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:08,410
to do push-ups so I set out to do some

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:09,760
number of push-ups every day another

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,040
thing that's gentleman so I like to blog

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,080
also like personal journaling and stuff

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,750
like that so have actually taken the

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,190
time to write today so yeah again the

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,300
thing that's really important here is

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,310
thinking about the things that are most

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,060
important to you having some way to

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,740
track them also personal items so I use

00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,120
the the Ivy Lee method actually over the

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,520
weekend as well so I use it for my

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,350
family time for weekend things you know

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,340
the honey-do list the things that I need

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,740
to do over the weekend that are

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,940
important as well but like I said the

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,850
important thing here is really tracking

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,580
your progress keeping track of how

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,020
you're doing because if you aren't

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,180
tracking it you can't measure it you

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,430
can't see your progress over time and

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,220
it's much harder to actually keep that

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,710
going so one of the best ways to track

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,630
your progress over time is a great segue

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,480
into the next technique it's the

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:02,260
Seinfeld strategy so for the Seinfeld

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,600
strategy the story goes that Seinfeld

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,850
was approached by a young comedian who

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,600
is trying to figure out how to becoming

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,920
better comedian I suppose and so we said

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,320
you know mr. Seinfeld you're such a

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,380
great comedian how did you get to be so

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,980
good at telling jokes and so Seinfeld

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,230
said okay

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,020
yeah you know all that you have to do

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,120
it's pretty simple you just set out to

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,440
do something every day you you commit

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,490
yourself to doing something every day in

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,810
his case he said write a joke every day

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:35,140
it doesn't matter if it's a good joke or

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:39,130
bad joke or whatever just write a single

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,690
joke every day next you should get a

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,790
calendar like one of those big wall

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,500
calendars put it up on your wall well

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,300
you'll see it every single day

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,820
maybe frequently throughout the day and

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,100
you'll put it up there and then get a

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,630
big marker maybe a big like red marker

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,690
that will really stand out and you'll

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,940
feel good about and put a mark on the

00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,690
day on the calendar for every single

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,820
time that you do this task once you do

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,440
this you'll start to go and you'll

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,060
you'll get like oh you'll do a day or

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,170
two maybe you'll miss a day and then

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,700
you'll get into a streak

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,680
you'll get going we're like five days

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,180
and you'll come up on that sixth day and

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,500
like man I have five days I don't want

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,940
to break this chain and then you'll get

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,950
up to a week and then we'll give it to

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,870
two weeks and just keeps going some of

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,140
the last piece here it's just don't

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,060
break the chain just keep it going it'll

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,350
become sort of a gamification at that

00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,830
point it becomes exciting and you can

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:32,350
see how far you can go now in all

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,320
honesty I felt has admitted that this

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,270
actually didn't happen this isn't a true

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,420
story however the technique is still

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:44,710
real keeping track of your progress

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:46,450
using a technique that this works so one

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,950
way of keeping track of your progress I

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,220
actually learned from one of my

00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,570
colleagues who's here under Steve perch

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,160
he I was actually looking through his

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,540
calendar we were scheduling something I

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,330
noticed he had some time at the end of

00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:01,780
his work day dedicated to sort of the

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,040
end of work day catch up or thing and I

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,630
asked him about that and he said yeah he

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,070
takes time out of every day to kind of

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,890
review the things that he did that day

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,930
and see how he was doing and you know if

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,280
he accomplished those things and this

00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,170
was happening at the same time that I

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,300
was learning about Ivy Lee and so it was

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,340
like oh this is perfect this is like

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,559
very similar complementary techniques

00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,789
and so I he had the

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,129
survey that he filled out and I said

00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:26,799
great of can i copy that can I make it

00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:29,740
my own and she said sure so it's just a

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,980
simple little google form you can go and

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,450
create it totally free you can ask you

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,190
yourself the questions of the things

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,779
that are important to you put them on

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,399
the list and then every day go through

00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:40,840
and fill it out and there's some cool

00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:43,029
things you can do here with Google Forms

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,919
one of them is it will actually give you

00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:47,529
stats over time you can see graphs to

00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,840
see how you're doing everyday another

00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:52,509
thing you can do is you can gamify this

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,639
a little bit to Google Forms lets you

00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,740
turn any questionnaire that you have

00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:58,899
into a quiz so that means you can choose

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,399
a right or wrong answer and give point

00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:03,279
values to the various things that you're

00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:07,749
doing so the answer the correct answer

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:09,009
to argument inbox zero is yes I should

00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:11,379
be at inbox here at the end of the day

00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:13,539
and if I do that if I check that yes box

00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:15,549
I get ten points and that feels pretty

00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,960
good and then the cool thing is once

00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:19,869
you've done this day after day after day

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,700
you can see in the graph how many points

00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:24,009
you're getting how you're doing your how

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,159
you doing it actually completing your

00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:28,990
goals so I did this for a while in the

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,899
Google Form and it worked pretty well I

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:34,600
I liked it quite a bit however I found

00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:36,279
another app that I have started using

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,850
that I like even more

00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:42,340
it's called todoist todoist is a local

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,100
sort of task management app if they have

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,379
a web app too but you're able to create

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,700
groups of different tasks that you're

00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:50,799
doing so you know I have a number of

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,480
tier on the side you're able to set

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,559
priorities and your set due dates and

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,440
kind of all the things that you'd expect

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,899
from a task list and so I created my you

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,360
know my six things today list I also

00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:03,369
created the six things backlog for all

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,840
of the things that I wasn't gonna do

00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:07,570
today but maybe I want to do tomorrow

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,039
and I went through my day this way and

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,450
one of the things that makes to do is

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,340
really work for me is again the

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,499
gamification the feeling of like I'm

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,129
accomplishing something and they do that

00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:20,470
by giving you points again again giving

00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:22,600
you points so as you go throughout your

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,100
day you set out to do a certain number

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,110
of tasks from your list every day and

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,700
they score you they give you points on

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,440
did you meet your goal so this little

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,409
gold star that I have here I love gold

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,030
stars if you meet your goal for the day

00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:36,520
you get a gold star and you'll get

00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,990
points for completing tasks for

00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,670
scheduling a new task for doing things

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,350
like that you accumulate other points

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,510
throughout the day here's actually

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,650
negative points and I think that was

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,170
because I had something that I'd

00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,880
scheduled that I didn't do on a day or I

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,590
postponed it for a couple more days or

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,160
something like that so I actually had

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:56,110
some points taken off and then this

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,240
stats so this actually plays really

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,580
nicely into the Seinfeld method because

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,410
you start accumulating more points for

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,960
the longer chain that you have going on

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:07,600
so if you start getting you know one day

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,220
two day three day seven days you start

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,120
earning burn bonus points for keeping

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:15,550
that chain going which is huge it helps

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,950
really visualize that and then of course

00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,780
since there are points there need to be

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,430
levels so there's different levels that

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,020
you can actually progress through so as

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:26,490
you accumulate points you go from one to

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:29,170
the other and then overall you can see

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,330
stats about how you're doing so a graph

00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,520
over time you can see over the last

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,350
seven days and kind of compare which is

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,310
really helpful for actually seeing how

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:41,710
you're doing so really all of this is

00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:44,380
trying to do is help you establish a

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,230
habit of productivity of creating this

00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,590
lifestyle of being more productive with

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:53,290
your time so one of my favorite quotes

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,510
that I've had since I think high school

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,230
is actually from Aristotle Aristotle

00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:01,720
said we are what we repeatedly do

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:05,140
excellence therefore is not an act but a

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,960
habit now the reason why I love this

00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,960
quote is because honestly I find it a

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,420
little humbling it's important for me to

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,410
remember that in order to get really

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,080
good at something in order to be

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,310
something that's excellent it's not

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,830
gonna happen overnight I'm not gonna

00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,660
decide to be a great guitar player just

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,910
by going out and buying a guitar and

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,910
saying yeah I'm a guitar player no it

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:31,810
takes habit it takes practice it takes a

00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:33,610
lot of time so one way that I can help

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,560
visualize this is actually removing the

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,940
word excellence and replacing it with

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,740
other things that are important to you

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:45,280
so we are repeatedly do being a leader

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:48,760
therefore is not a single act but I have

00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,520
it maybe for some people it's getting

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,650
fit maybe it's not you know that again

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,220
the diet pill maybe it's working out

00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,840
eating healthy and then another thing

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,679
that really resonates with me is is good

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,230
parenting being a good father for my son

00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,890
and daughters is not a single thing that

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,179
I can do

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,920
it's a long-lasting relationship of

00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,290
caring and love and being there for them

00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:17,460
and that's that's really important it's

00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:21,370
good to be remember reminded about that

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,230
so what do you think in order to

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,470
establish a good habit towards good

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:28,330
parenting for example what's a habit

00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,990
that would actually encourage us towards

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,840
that direction

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,340
towards being or trying to be well

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,900
before we can actually ask ourselves

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,600
what that habit is I think it's

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,510
important to actually try to define the

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,700
things that are actually important to us

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:47,590
I've been surprised how it's really

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,470
difficult like it is surprisingly

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,750
difficult to think very critically about

00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,580
the things that are important to you

00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,560
most people don't even do that don't

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,360
take the time to consider they just kind

00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,280
of live their life and so stopping

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,470
taking the moment to to think about that

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,870
is important and as you go through you

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,100
know your list you can ask yourself some

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,300
questions like you know why is this

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,770
important to me you know maybe it's more

00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,780
than a single sentence maybe you write a

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,850
blog post maybe you write look a few

00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:17,530
paragraphs about why this thing is

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:19,750
important to you it's also important to

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,420
think about how the thing that's

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,710
important to you will actually change

00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,740
you know will this have positive or

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,050
negative effects how will this thing

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,850
affect other people in your life and

00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,980
then ultimately what will you actually

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,960
do when you meet your goal what will

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,970
that look like try to visualize what

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,860
that would be when you reach your goal

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,290
when you do this thing that's important

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,420
to you

00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,160
so again Steve perch is is one of my

00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,800
colleagues and as I was talking to him

00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,350
through this section he reminded me

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,030
something that I hadn't considered and

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,929
that is you know I was coming to this

00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:58,210
thinking originally about this sort of

00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:59,280
like peak productivity making myself the

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,530
best I can be

00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,750
sort of putting myself as you know

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,610
trying to find harmony and happiness and

00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:10,020
all that stuff and he reminded me that

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:14,190
for some people that may not be what

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:18,030
they're going for for example if you are

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:19,980
a PhD student you might like the idea of

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,900
being up all night working on your

00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,940
thesis you might be eating junk food or

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,070
fast food because that is you know

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,990
getting your PhD you know focusing on

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,000
that one thing is the most important

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:32,760
thing to them at that moment so it may

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,430
not be harmony and balance it really

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,900
might be getting stuff done like doing

00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:40,340
the thing that you think is actually

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,510
most important and for some people that

00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,890
have a lot of anxiety they're feeling

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,460
really stressed they have too much on

00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,100
their plate

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,600
it may not be balancing all these

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,570
different things it might be removing

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:56,910
things reducing things from your life

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:58,110
simplifying things so for me I sat down

00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,760
I thought about the things that are

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,580
important and some of this is kind of

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,830
over kind of inherited from that list I

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,970
showed you before but I realized it's

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,560
important to me to get up at 5:00 a.m.

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,560
who here loves to get up at 5:00 a.m.

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,270
yeah there's a few people here that are

00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,650
into that personally I don't like

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,810
getting up at 5:00 a.m. I'm gonna be

00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:20,940
honest I am NOT a morning person but I

00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,160
found when I get up at 5:00 a.m. when I

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,680
can wake up before my kids wake up I am

00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,720
so much happier throughout the day when

00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,270
I can wake myself up and maybe even get

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,640
a few things done around the house I am

00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:35,430
so much happier than when the kids run

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,350
in at 6 7 whatever time it is and are

00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,520
waking me up like I that's that's not

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,530
good I'm not a happy person at that

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,150
point so getting up at 5:00 a.m. is

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:46,200
important to me because it makes me

00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,580
better and more prepared also again

00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,690
reading and praying is important to me

00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,420
because it puts me in that headspace

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,640
that I need to be at also I have a list

00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,200
of daily affirmations that I read out

00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,020
loud this is again some more

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,270
productivity research that kind of being

00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,410
put into practice that I'm trying

00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:03,780
basically you know reminding yourself

00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,950
every day why these things are important

00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,510
to you you know why your job is

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,730
important why your family is important

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,170
what you can do to be better at those

00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,910
things saying those a lot every day does

00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:15,640
help you to keep those the top of your

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:18,910
mind and then actually picking

00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:22,570
tomorrow's tasks and so taking a step

00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:26,080
back full disclosure I started doing Ivy

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:29,140
Lee about a year year and a half ago and

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,450
that worked pretty well for a while but

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,540
it stopped working for me part of the

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,680
reason was because I was traveling a lot

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,810
anytime that I traveled it would kind of

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,230
throw me off my game and as I said I

00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:42,700
would fall into that excuse of I don't

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,160
have time to come up with a list of

00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,690
things I'm just gonna focus on my email

00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,850
and get caught up and focus on this and

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:53,950
get caught up and I fell into this trap

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:56,500
and so I when I when I was coming

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,450
through this process uh about a couple

00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,920
months ago and coming up with this list

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,750
and preparing for this presentation and

00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,310
thinking about what it would take to

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,300
actually make myself more productive I

00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:09,730
realized Ivy Lee is still a good process

00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,650
but I can't rely on it as the only

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,120
process there right I can't say Ivy Lee

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:16,270
is the thing that I'm doing and that's

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,030
all that I'm doing because my life is a

00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,530
little complicated when I travel I can't

00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,750
always I can't always do that so I'm

00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,400
still doing picking tomorrow's tasks but

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,630
I'm using the sort of modified version

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,930
of Ivy Lee that works a little bit

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:31,630
better for me so I looked at this I

00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,250
regionally thought the habit that I want

00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,490
to establish is getting up at 5:00 a.m.

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,720
I think I think it made sense when I get

00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,790
up at 5:00 a.m. all those other things

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,880
gets to be a lot easier I'm much happier

00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,800
but I found ultimately if that's my

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,290
habit if that's what I'm trying to do

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,200
I can't reliably do that every day I'll

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:51,760
wake up at 5 a.m. and realize I don't

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,430
want to get up at 5 a.m. and I'll go

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,140
back to sleep so I thought about ok what

00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:59,590
habit can I establish that will actually

00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,150
support these things like what will my

00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,680
priority be that will make these things

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:07,080
even more possible and I realized I

00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,640
realized it's going to bed at 9:00 p.m.

00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,770
before this point I was going to bed at

00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,900
1:00 to 3:00 in the morning sometimes

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,940
and it wasn't always like oh I'm

00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,160
watching Netflix or anything it was

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,570
often like yeah I'm packing on this

00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,340
project and things are going pretty well

00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,950
and I'm doing pretty good I feel good

00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,500
about this I'm like oh man it's it's

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,970
3:00

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,000
the morning I need to go to bed my kids

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:31,580
will be awake in three hours yeah that's

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,590
no good so forcing myself establishing a

00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,540
habit to go to bed at 9:00 p.m. is way

00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,000
easier than forcing myself to get up at

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,250
5:00 a.m. and it reinforces all these

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,840
other things that I'm doing so I thought

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,090
about this and I thought about what can

00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,620
I do to help remind myself in track none

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,899
of those other techniques really are

00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,950
those those apps really do this super

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:52,190
well

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:54,679
so I created a spreadsheet I created

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,659
this habit-forming checklist here at the

00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,360
top we have a a section where you can

00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:01,550
type in your or I printed this out and

00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,020
kind of hand written it I put in my

00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,460
habit I can put in notes about why this

00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,200
thing is important to me to remind

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,760
myself and then I have a checklist so I

00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,320
can go throughout the day's check off

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,120
the days that I actually do the habit

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,410
the thing that I want to do and then I

00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,810
actually have a section here for notes

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,960
and the point of the notes is that as I

00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,520
go throughout the week I might have

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,670
little tweaks that I need to make to it

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,860
so for example I helped organize mid

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,170
camp the Chicago Drupal camp and those

00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,190
meetings started at 8 o'clock now I

00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,890
don't know if any of you have ever

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,140
helped organize camps before but those

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:36,710
meetings don't often end on time they

00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,270
often go much later so my wife and one

00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,340
of my best friends is my accountability

00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,900
buddies and so anytime there's sort of a

00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,490
exception to the rule that I need to

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,220
make I personally need the

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:47,480
accountability and so I'll say hey I'm

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,190
gonna be late I'm not gonna get to bed

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,420
on time this day is this does this make

00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,000
sense or am i kind of cheating the

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,320
system or whatever until it'll say ok so

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,300
then I'll write in a note kind of

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,580
explaining why to myself to remind

00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,950
myself why this happened and then in the

00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:04,370
bottom here I have a section called

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,510
daily incidentals and now I named that

00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,880
intentionally these are all the things

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,220
that I said are important to me that

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,320
happen sort of incidentally as a result

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,970
of doing my habit so you know that's

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,650
where I put all those things and I cross

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,390
the moss throughout the week as I go and

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,650
do that and now I created another

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,200
section so let me actually jump ahead

00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,600
and show you what this looks like for my

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,010
first five weeks oh I should say it

00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,660
takes about ten weeks to actually

00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,460
establish a habit and make it automatic

00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:31,070
so that you don't have to think about

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,630
doing it anymore so if you print off two

00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,160
of these sheets you'll have ten weeks

00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,610
and if you do it for ten weeks you

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,450
should probably be pretty close to that

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,369
so I have this year

00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,470
I filled it out you can see I had a weak

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,420
rat travel to San Francisco and I wasn't

00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:46,460
intending to keep to the 9 p.m. for that

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,839
week because we were at a team retreat

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,970
we're gonna be hanging out playing board

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,550
games up late at night and so I wasn't

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,690
expecting that and that was fine but

00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,640
down to the bottom here so I have my

00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,440
list going across and I have a section

00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,750
here and this is meant I mean I made it

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,359
to be really flexible so I have this

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,220
section here why I have push ups I

00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:07,220
mentioned earlier push ups are important

00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,950
to me 10 or so a day and so I created

00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,480
push ups and I tally off the days that I

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,040
do push ups and how many sets that I do

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,510
I also have a section here it's a little

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,910
hard to see because of the little ruffle

00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:19,849
but how am I feeling mentally and

00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,560
physically and kind of go through and

00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:23,390
number that on a scale of one to five

00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,740
and then I this empty space on the

00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,970
bottom where I can like write in notes I

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,339
can say oh I wasn't feeling well that

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:32,270
day I was kind of sick or whatever and

00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:33,589
then kind of go through so this has been

00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,680
working pretty well for me and if you

00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:37,670
guys want this I I didn't I was able to

00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,050
get them printed out and I couldn't

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,380
bring them to you but if you check out

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,349
my blog

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,599
David Needham got me my latest blog post

00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:46,220
I just published it today has this in it

00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,450
and you can download the PDF and print

00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,050
it for yourself if you want to check it

00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:52,130
out so based on all these things based

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,260
on all these techniques we've talked

00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,569
about so far how many of you here feel

00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:00,710
like this would make you at least 1%

00:37:56,569 --> 00:38:03,920
more productive with your day alright

00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:05,569
pretty much everyone great so let me now

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,470
introduce you with that in mind and kind

00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:08,089
of hold that in the back of your head

00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:11,839
with that in mind let me introduce you

00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:15,230
to fill Fredo Perez oh the parental

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,380
principle now this might be also kind of

00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:22,250
more widely known as the 80/20 rule so

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:25,010
with the 80/20 rule he was a like

00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,260
scientist at the time and noticed as he

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,349
was gardening going going through his

00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,450
garden he noticed that about 20% of the

00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:37,099
like little pea pods in his garden

00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:39,369
created 80% of the yield so you know 20%

00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:41,780
of his Peas the the plants actually did

00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:44,990
80% of all the peas that that were

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,390
generated he thought that was kind of

00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,460
curious and actually I think he was a

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,810
economist but he started looking and

00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,450
looking at other things around the world

00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,540
and realized

00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:56,550
habet happened over and over again it

00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,470
wasn't just in his garden he started

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,470
noticing other places so he he noticed

00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:05,280
that in Italy 80% of the land was owned

00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:06,960
by about 20% of the people okay

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,840
let's well let's keep going he also

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,700
noticed in Great Britain that 30% of the

00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,670
population earned about 70 percent of

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,170
the income so very similar and you

00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,190
realize as we go through and looks at

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,190
all these different things this can be

00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:21,840
applied time and time again to all sorts

00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,780
of things in your life for many

00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,540
companies it's some uncommon for about

00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:30,030
20% of the clients to represent 80

00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:33,420
percent of the income that they earn so

00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,070
maybe you have that one awesome client

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,350
that has all of your projects that keeps

00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,940
you going a week after week month after

00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:43,550
month and all the stuff that could be

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:46,470
one idea and so we start thinking about

00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:49,740
why why did that happen why does the

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:52,500
80/20 80/20 principle work and it

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,690
ultimately comes down to this theory of

00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,610
sort of this winner-take-all mentality

00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,600
where in this case you have this

00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:01,830
business where you're fighting for some

00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,930
some new project you're pitching it

00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:07,260
you're putting yourself out there you

00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,310
don't have to be you know significantly

00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,110
better than your competition

00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:12,180
you just have to be enough better than

00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,850
your competition so that you win and

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,950
then once you win you can put that logo

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,930
on your website and make it a little bit

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,520
better against for your next pitch for

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,350
your next proposal you'll have that work

00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,720
in your portfolio to show off which

00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,040
makes you much a little bit more likely

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,280
to win that next project thing it kind

00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,130
of builds upon itself another like 1%

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,470
thing is like winner-take-all of your

00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,320
applying for this new job you don't have

00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,580
to be just you know amazingly better

00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,590
than everyone else you just have to be

00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,350
slightly better you just have to be 1%

00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:44,850
better and it adds up over time you you

00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,290
can add that you know you get that job

00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,030
it come it goes on your resume you have

00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,920
this experience the next job it's a

00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,000
little bit better and easier and this

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,980
can be applied to all sorts of things

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,950
too and this this explains why the 80/20

00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,020
rule works the way it does in his garden

00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:02,940
those plants compete for the same

00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:04,230
resources one pea plant might get a

00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,849
little bit more sunlight than the rest

00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,880
of the plants

00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:09,410
so it grows 1% bigger which means it has

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,019
more leaves which means it gets even

00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,700
more sunlight also its roots grow just

00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:16,130
slightly longer than the rest of them

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,799
which means it's getting more water and

00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,869
that starts building up that those

00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:22,670
plants end up getting much much bigger

00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:25,460
and 1% day-after-day

00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,440
adds up to be quite a bit also

00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,019
politicians compete for the same votes

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,640
once a politician is everyone has heard

00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:33,589
of this politician that won the election

00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,749
so at that point even if they do a

00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:37,309
really poor job they're significantly

00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:38,839
more likely to be elected the next year

00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:40,210
over someone that you've never heard of

00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:43,099
before

00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:45,559
authors compete for the same New York

00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:46,849
Times bestseller list once you get on

00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:48,440
the bestseller list you can put that on

00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:49,970
your book and you're much more likely to

00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,450
hear your next book and then you're much

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,470
more likely to get on the list again

00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,880
athletes compete for the same gold medal

00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,339
same thing it's all about getting just

00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,450
slightly better getting there first

00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:01,460
crossing the finish line before anyone

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,710
else companies compete for the same

00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,799
client and then TV shows you know once

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,970
you get in that sort of primetime spot

00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:10,279
you're you're much more likely to stay

00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,049
in that primetime spot then if your show

00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,660
got into some off hours where nobody's

00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:16,249
watching it no in this day and age that

00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,680
probably isn't actually as much of a

00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:21,469
factor but it's you know it's still

00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,930
something that worked back then so

00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:26,539
ultimately the margin between good and

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,900
great is much much more narrow than you

00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:32,989
expect it really just does come down to

00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:34,700
1% 1% day after day continuous

00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:36,460
improvement focusing on making yourself

00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,930
more efficient more productive

00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,380
establishing these habits that's what

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,549
makes things difference and so you all

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,930
raised your hand a little bit ago and

00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:46,460
said you know some of these techniques

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,719
that we've talked about what improve

00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,119
your productivity or improve your

00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:53,210
happiness or effectiveness by at least

00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,309
1% so if you do that every day you'll be

00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,989
1% better I've had each of those things

00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:59,079
which will add up and the thing is

00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:02,839
really again taking us seriously being

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:05,359
deliberate about doing it every day and

00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:09,469
so what are the results so when you're

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,969
in this sort of success of being

00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:13,489
productive when I was at sort of the top

00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:15,859
of my game of IV Lee and it was working

00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:17,869
I was feeling really great I felt

00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,620
amazing I I got through my list of 6

00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:20,300
things

00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,890
it took me about a week to actually get

00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,080
through my list of things six things and

00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,530
really like find a list of things that

00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,710
worked

00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,240
I felt so amazing and then every day

00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,950
going after that I could look back on my

00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,830
list see the things that I did feel good

00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,270
about it and it worked really well and

00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,550
then I started you know amending it and

00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:40,630
changing my plan and creating an even

00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:43,490
better one and then again ultimately

00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:45,440
it's really cool to know that yesterday

00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,690
I said these are the things that are

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,890
most important for me to do and to do

00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,360
those things to do the things that are

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:53,840
most important just feels really good

00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:57,020
and ultimately you also get more things

00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,070
done by focusing your time and looking

00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,630
and being delivered about it being

00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,340
proactive you're able to get more things

00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:04,490
done with your day and then you can

00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,470
prioritize urgent tasks so let's say

00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,690
you're doing the Ivy Lee method or some

00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:13,430
other technique and your boss comes to

00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:15,410
you and says Joe we have this new

00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,930
project coming in I need you to meet

00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:21,980
with a client in three hours to scope it

00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:24,260
out okay it's not possible for me to say

00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,300
oh I'm sorry but like it's down to my

00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,280
Ivy Lee list for today but you know I

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,980
can add it to the list for tomorrow

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,480
that's just not gonna fly so the cool

00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,340
thing is though is if you have your

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,620
private your your Ivy Lee list if you

00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,360
have your six things you're doing today

00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,530
you can go to your boss or your boss

00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,210
comes to you you can talk through it and

00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:43,220
say okay well here are the things that I

00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,680
said was important today where does this

00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,850
fit in that priority how does this

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,110
compare that you this thing that you're

00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,880
asking me to do whatever this thing is

00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,770
how does this is actually compared to

00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,420
the other things that I think are I

00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,950
should be working on today and then you

00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,860
can talk about that and figure out where

00:44:54,950 --> 00:45:00,500
it needs to go also you feel more

00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,270
prepared if you are thinking about the

00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,070
meetings you have tomorrow today if

00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,540
you're doing the things that you need to

00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:08,990
do for those in advance it means that

00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:11,270
you are prepared for those things so I

00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,040
mentioned at the beginning that Ivy Lee

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:15,770
told Charles Schwab that he could pay

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,810
him whatever he wants right well how

00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,810
much do you guys think he paid him

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:31,220
so at the end of the day Charles Schwab

00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:33,530
wrote Ivy Lee a check for $25,000 so at

00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,300
first $25,000

00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,660
doesn't really seem like all that much

00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:41,150
it probably seems like he maybe didn't

00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,730
think that was all that effective but

00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:48,190
with inflation and all that stuff this

00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:51,530
is actually $400,000 in today's money

00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:54,800
now again remember Charles Schwab shrewd

00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:57,350
businessman extremely wealthy CEO of

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,150
this big company paid a Productivity

00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,650
expert whatever he wanted he could have

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,620
paid him nothing and it would have been

00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:06,920
totally fine he paid him $400,000

00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:09,140
because he saw the techniques that he

00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,000
had suggested in practice he saw that

00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,040
they worked he was seeing the results of

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,630
that and it was really good for him

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,850
so $400,000 up so these slides are

00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:22,160
available you can see the URL up at the

00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,270
top also I have references we can find

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,700
some more of the techniques that we've

00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:35,980
talked about today so with that I will

00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:35,980
open it up to questions yes sir

00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:45,630
yes absolutely so inbox zero tips so I

00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:48,030
personally feel much more productive and

00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,340
sane when I don't have hundreds or

00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,750
thousands of emails in my inbox and so

00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,300
if you're using something like Ivy Lee

00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:56,700
if you have this list of things that you

00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,890
know you need to do an email that's in

00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,810
my inbox still means that I either need

00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,040
to reply to it or it has some sort of

00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,290
important information that I need to

00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,000
remember if it's not that either of

00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:08,190
those two I can just archive it and you

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,320
know search for it later if I need to so

00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:13,200
the technique that I use is if this

00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:16,290
thing needs to be replied to I will add

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,630
it to my list in my Ivy Lee and I'll say

00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,850
reply to email blah blah blah whatever

00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:24,450
whatever it is and then I will archive

00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,800
that email so it's I use Gmail and it's

00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,930
still in my inbox I can search for it I

00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,030
can find it but I add it to my my list

00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,740
my task list so it's not forgotten I

00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:34,650
don't see it on my list so it clears up

00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,630
my mind but it is on my Ivy Lee list and

00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,980
I have that time dedicated to focus on

00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,260
this particular email that I need to do

00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,230
there's other apps as well like

00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,600
boomerang is a really popular one yes

00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:47,340
where is one that we use at Pantheon and

00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,650
it really makes it easier to sort of

00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,240
bounce these emails out and back so you

00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:58,760
don't have to keep them kind of

00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:58,760
preoccupied in your inbox yes sir

00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:12,030
yeah the question was it can be really

00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,830
easy to get kind of lost in your work

00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,570
and how would it be helpful to have like

00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,700
an alarm or something like the Pomodoro

00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,980
method to to keep you focused on your

00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,710
time certainly yeah set setting an alarm

00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,570
and you know saying you know I'm setting

00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:26,190
a time limit on these tasks you know if

00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,680
all of these are equally important if

00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,820
all of these need to be done today you

00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,470
know because I have a deadline tomorrow

00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,720
or something then certainly you'd want

00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,860
to set an alarm or something to keep

00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,490
yourself on track with what you're

00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:40,140
trying to do yep and i-i've Pomodoro's

00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,640
another productivity technique that that

00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,670
mentions like a certain amount of time

00:48:41,640 --> 00:49:24,180
highly focused and you have some highly

00:48:44,670 --> 00:49:26,100
focused time that's another right great

00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:30,630
question let me repeat it so the first

00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:31,860
one is what do I do like I have my list

00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,510
of six things and I feel like things are

00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,480
going well I have something else I need

00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:38,340
to add to my list do I finish my six

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,730
things first and then do the the other

00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:44,220
stuff is it yeah so so for that one

00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,960
it depends it's a it's okay to

00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,610
reevaluate your list throughout the day

00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,680
if something important comes up that you

00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,720
need to prioritize over the other stuff

00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,040
then you can put that in your list if

00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,570
you have something come up that's it's

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,000
not important that it doesn't need to be

00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:59,040
do need to be done today that I would

00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,980
put it into my six things backlog and

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,570
then consider it tomorrow get through my

00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,490
six things and another another common

00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,020
question that I've heard is okay so if I

00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:09,780
finish the six things I'm working on by

00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,220
noon I can just stop working right well

00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,570
not exactly probably not you're

00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,610
depending on where your work place that

00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,150
probably wouldn't be okay if you finish

00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:18,119
your six thing

00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,289
and you still have time to work which is

00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,640
really common when you're first starting

00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:22,460
out with the Ivy League because you're

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,960
not super good at judging your time

00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:27,359
that's when you pull from that backlog

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,430
of of things that you had said this is

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,049
something I think is important it's not

00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,759
important today so it's I'm not gonna

00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:34,680
put it on my list for today but it's

00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:35,849
here like I can refer to it and then if

00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,740
you get through everything on your list

00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:39,240
you'd have that backlog to look at and

00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,329
think about okay well I'm gonna work on

00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,970
this thing that I wanted to do and then

00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:46,559
the second question was should I have

00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:50,009
any tips or suggestions for like keeping

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:54,539
work list separate or integrated with

00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:58,259
personal family lists I do keep them

00:50:54,539 --> 00:51:01,279
separate but it depends on on how how

00:50:58,259 --> 00:51:04,680
you prioritize your time I suppose so I

00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:06,210
typically have a weekend like like

00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,099
family time backlog and I have a work

00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:10,349
backlog and then as I'm going through

00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:12,299
and creating my list if it's Saturday or

00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:14,460
Sunday or a day that I have off I'll be

00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:16,289
pulling tasks from my family backlog to

00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,779
build that list and if it's the weekday

00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:20,430
and it's like a regular work day then

00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:23,249
I'll probably be pulling for my my

00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:24,869
regular daily work stuff but I still

00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:27,269
have the family backlog I can refer to

00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:32,390
if I have extra time in the evening to

00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:32,390
work on something yes

00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:11,380
right right so the question was if

00:52:09,549 --> 00:52:13,869
you're in like a support role if you

00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,859
have some relative pretty regular things

00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,480
that are happening throughout the day

00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:18,160
that you need to give attention to that

00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,190
you can't necessarily prioritize or

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,839
baked into a list how do you sort of

00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:26,650
balance that is that somewhat up you

00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:29,589
will so ultimately remember the very

00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,849
first that first slide I guess the third

00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:32,890
slide where I say look you need to make

00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:35,410
this list your own whatever technique

00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:37,390
that you feel like has pieces that will

00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,710
work well for you it's important to your

00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,410
schedule that's actually going to be

00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:43,240
effective you know eating where the Ivy

00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:45,579
Lee method just isn't a good fit then

00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,960
make the I really into method into

00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:50,619
something that will be a good fit so

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,119
maybe it involves you know a list where

00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:53,770
maybe you have I'm gonna work on the

00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:55,270
first thing and then I take an hour for

00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,410
focus on this other stuff and then I

00:52:55,270 --> 00:53:00,069
have another thing and I have an hour

00:52:56,410 --> 00:53:03,910
for focusing on other stuff or maybe the

00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:06,040
Ivy League could allow you to give you

00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,690
the priority and then able to like bump

00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,720
things in unexpected things as they

00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:12,579
happen as they come up but ultimately

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,609
maybe the Ivy Lee isn't a good method

00:53:12,579 --> 00:53:17,200
for for that sort of a workflow it just

00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:20,609
I'd be happy to talk more specifics

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,609
about that after if you have time

00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:24,490
alright hope thank you all very much for

00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:30,740
coming to my talk today

00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:32,820
[Applause]

00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:35,700
all right since you guys stuck around

00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,590
and we have like two-and-a-half extra

00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,090
minutes I have a couple bonus slides for

00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:43,349
you

00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:45,960
so bonus technique number one habit

00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:47,730
stacking it is really difficult to

00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,380
establish a new habit so if you have

00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,940
something you already have as a habit

00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,040
like for example brushing your teeth

00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,760
every morning taking a shower making

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,420
coffee

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,470
you can hijack that a little bit and

00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,869
kind of combine that with a different

00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:02,910
habit to make it a little bit easier to

00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:06,380
establish a new habit so I use the

00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:09,030
digital echidna stuffed echidnas to

00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,440
basically I say every day that I have a

00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:12,300
meeting every time that I have a meeting

00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,070
I put in a kid not on my desk in order

00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,980
to get that a kid off of my desk I need

00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,720
to do a set of push-ups and so over the

00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,400
days I might have multiple meetings in a

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,410
row I'm going to accumulate I might

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,730
accumulate a kid in a debt but I have to

00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:30,240
work off by pumping out push-ups and the

00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:31,589
second one is a technique called Kaizen

00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,359
it's kind of popularized for in like

00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:37,619
Toyota and the Japanese manufacturing

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:40,140
the technique says basically that it's a

00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:43,140
basically easier to remove than to add

00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:45,990
new things it's easier to I guess it's

00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:48,560
much harder to do more great work it's

00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:54,089
much much easier to do less bad work

00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:56,670
some practical examples of this is you

00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:58,349
know it's much easier or it's actually

00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:01,410
very difficult to earn more income

00:54:58,349 --> 00:55:03,690
throughout your day it no new job get a

00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:06,480
raise whatever it's much much easier to

00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:08,580
spend less now that's not a fun sexy

00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,630
technique but it's something that can be

00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,460
applied to all sorts of things

00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,609
throughout your day as well so thanks

00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,609
again

00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:18,530
