Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Getting closer to your customer: Using Drupal in the last mile
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	With all of the advances in DevOps, it is easy to focus on delivering more, faster, as our important measures of success. However, DevOps is as much about listening as it is about delivering. How do we know we are delivering the right things? How are we informing our customers of this work and getting their feedback effectively?

If our project is using Drupal, it usually ends up being operated by the end users being delivered to. With Drupal being so close to the customer in production, we can use all of its powers to leverage new feedback loops and truly measure our success by customer satisfaction. 

In this talk we'll look at using Drupal:

to communicate "What's New/Fixed" to our Drupal end users with each delivery
provide our end users contextual guides and resources on site features
to gather feedback on the usefulness of our guidance
to collect feature requests and bug reports
Ultimately we'll look at how Drupal, as a CMS, fits into a DevOps mindset, fully closing the loop between what's developed and what's in operation.

Attendees of any level of experience will walk away with ideas for using Drupal to get closer to their customers and continuously improve their product.

	00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,720
everybody still a few minutes early but

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:27,490
I thought something that would be cool

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:32,470
to do is see if maybe this session could

00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:36,010
have the most feedback on it so so ever

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:40,600
you have a computer some pen and paper

00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:43,930
that's cool so if you go to this URL and

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,590
there's a button there for submit

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,750
feedback one cool thing you could do is

00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,310
you can hit that button and you could

00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,680
fill it out already

00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,220
to start with what your expectations are

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,440
and then in the bottom of it in the

00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,150
comments you could kind of you could

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,760
write like what you're hoping to get out

00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,259
of this session and then anytime you

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
think of something during the session

00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:10,119
you can note in there and then when the

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,869
session is over all you have to do is

00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:16,360
hit submit great

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,140
so like preload that feedback at that

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,380
ready cuz I would really value that as a

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,670
speaker and it would be really cool to

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,880
to be the session that got the most

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,560
feedback so I'm looking I'm hoping to

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:38,369
get one piece of feedback for everybody

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:40,299
in this audience that sound cool yeah

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,090
what they think it was weird because

00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:45,189
most sessions might get like four or

00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,729
five pieces of feedback and if we had

00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,729
like 20 or something that'd be cool

00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:59,329
that's a URL of this talk

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,100
is the button on it button for feedback

00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:06,149
you guys are just nodding I'm just

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:10,410
talking and you guys are nodding there's

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,650
no button up by the title the top of the

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:20,220
paragraph nothing to provide feedback oh

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:24,690
my goodness this is I will now we've got

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,010
different feedback to give well now I

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,390
don't know what the hell you do that I

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,390
thought that was a really good idea

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:53,840
oh you have to be logged in oh but

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:58,630
someone has the button Oh beautiful all

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,630
right some okay good some people have it

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,489
all right super theme I'm gonna get and

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,079
get started here

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:19,070
it's a 25-minute session talk is usually

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,299
longer so I'm gonna cruise through it

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,920
[Music]

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,780
faster I'm Kelly Albrecht

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,390
I'm with last call media and doing a lot

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,280
of agile coaching kind of product on a

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,810
roll business consulting there and the

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,700
title of stock is getting closer to your

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:42,900
customer using Drupal in the last mile

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:45,920
so first I want you to think about how

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,750
close are you now to your customers

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,209
half a mile some people are maybe a

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,819
quarter-mile some some people's

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,129
customers are right here I mean like how

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,819
many customer service people anybody

00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:03,780
doing kind of a customer service role or

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:08,150
anybody in like a marketing role or on a

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:13,319
product team how many people are doing

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,940
they're doing the deployments or are you

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,370
a developer you're doing the development

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,260
you're you're making you're making the

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,010
thing that goes into operation you're

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,849
developing the product that then gets

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,159
later operated if you're in a small

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,229
business you can get pretty close pretty

00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:32,550
easily to your customer and that can be

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,860
a really cool thing you do a good job

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,430
you get that feedback you get that

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,039
customer satisfaction but how are we

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,949
going to get closer to our customers at

00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,050
scale if we have hundreds of customers

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,590
or thousands of customers how do we

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:54,419
retain that same level of communication

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,699
and that same relationship one of the

00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:00,720
one of the ways that people are looking

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:03,360
at this is by using a mindset called

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,010
DevOps there are a lot of misconceptions

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,800
about DevOps I think some people think

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:13,229
DevOps is just stuff with the servers a

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,550
lot of people that maybe have had a

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,470
little bit more experience think of

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:25,139
automation when they think of DevOps

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:27,870
so DevOps is this idea that started when

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,900
people realized that the development

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,979
team and the operations team in an

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,229
organization seems to have this wall of

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,699
confusion between them and the

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,919
development team would develop the

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,870
product and then they would throw their

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,050
product over the wall to the operations

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,180
team who would then reconfigure the work

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,219
Ries crypt some of the deployment and

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,949
then they would deploy it into their own

00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:57,659
precious production zone of operation

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:59,219
and you know and as organizations

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:02,610
companies scaled and their customer

00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:06,629
bases scaled and their and what was in

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:10,490
operation became huge this model became

00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:13,650
ridiculous it became a source of

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,620
miscommunication rework finger-pointing

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,169
blaming and there was a big surge in the

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,379
industry to think about how do we get

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:25,650
these two teams to work more closely

00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,349
together how do we break down this wall

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:32,719
of confusion how do we break down this

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:36,690
barrier between the dev and the ops team

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:39,659
and a lot of work has been going into

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,740
that a lot of people think of DevOps now

00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:45,120
as frequent rapid release cycles as

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,819
automated deployment with automated

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,789
rollback as continuous integration with

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,580
automated testing basically automating

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:57,779
everywhere where possible to work

00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:01,560
together and get these this this value

00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:04,440
deployed easier more frequently with

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,159
fewer miscommunications and fewer things

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,719
gone wrong in addition to that you might

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:15,990
think of the feedback mechanisms being

00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:18,569
also automated pinging servers in or the

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,610
like much more complicated to detect

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,289
errors before the customer can see them

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,230
and fix fix it before the customer

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:30,320
experiences it this has been

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,300
up until very recently this is a kind of

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,050
a trending topic right now to think

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,270
about well if we can just automate

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,550
everything maybe we can just automate

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:45,110
the operations team and we'll never have

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:47,030
to talk to them again we can just

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,040
automate the deployment so you there's

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,260
you know go to Twitter hashtag no ops

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,140
people are posting about this idea there

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,030
was a paper written back in 2009 saying

00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,070
that we can just automate this whole

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,120
thing and just deploy things right to

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:05,750
operation without any other team

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,760
automate everything where possible this

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,500
particular slide is not useful to this

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,780
talk because we're gonna go a little

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,430
further than this and I'm going to say

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,320
submit to you that this is a

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,530
short-sighted misunderstanding of the

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,840
DevOps mindset breaking down the

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,160
barriers between the DevOps team the dev

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,270
team and the ops team was a great

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,880
starting point but there is more to it

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:33,740
to get value into operation and to the

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,260
customer than just this little step you

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,090
get in an operation and while it's in

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,830
operation you have the product team you

00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,260
might if it's for a lot of places might

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,470
have a community manager or a customer

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,570
success team and and it eventually gets

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:53,210
to some customers who receive that value

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:55,100
and my question to no ops is what are we

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,630
gonna do automate this whole thing we're

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,570
gonna automate the product and the

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,510
community team are we gonna

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,250
automatically just I think no ops is

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,860
just kicking the can down the road a

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:12,260
little bit and it's missing the point of

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,880
a DevOps mindset I'll point out that I

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,490
don't know if people watch everything

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,040
that Amazon tells them to but Amazon

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,890
told me to watch Philip dicks electric

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,100
dreams a couple months ago and season 1

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,590
episode 2 had a episode called Auto FAQ

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,220
and the app and the episode is basically

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:33,590
about where artificial intelligence and

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,050
machines had taken over and they were

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,460
producing products producing products

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,110
producing products but then humanity

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,220
went extinct

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,990
so the machines made robot humans to

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,310
consume the products that it was

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,220
creating because the products were

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,270
getting were piling up otherwise I don't

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,440
think that we're gonna do that and I

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:56,120
don't think that that fits with the

00:09:51,440 --> 00:10:00,320
DevOps mindset so a DevOps mindset

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,930
actually is about having people work

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,340
together better developers testers and

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,250
operation engineers working together

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,970
having a common business oriented goal

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:15,200
that covers the whole value chain that a

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:18,230
product for delivery or product and the

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,580
team's the team working as one has the

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,920
authority to make the changes it needs

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,980
to make to adapt to deliver a better

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,120
product and the feedback mechanisms that

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,040
are in place are more than just

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,010
monitoring servers or code quality

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,160
they're in place to ensure continuous

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,120
assessment of that the fact of whether

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,220
or not we're delivering the right

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,410
product and looking for continuous

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:45,530
improvement and learning so we need the

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,690
we need the Ops people we need all the

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,040
people maybe things consolidate and

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,900
things get more efficient but this is

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,090
about working together all of us so if

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,880
we accept that we're not going no ops

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:03,410
and we're going to go with with with

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,380
DevOps and the ideas behind it how do we

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,750
think about this arrangement of teams

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,670
for things like rapid release cycles for

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,920
things like working together better and

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,750
for things like knowing that we're

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,910
delivering the right product and and

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,910
getting ideas on how to improve it so

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:27,860
rather than that very linear model or

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,900
concept of teams we can think of things

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,420
as more of a circle where we're

00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,820
delivering and we're getting feedback

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,470
and we're planning based on that

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,380
feedback how to improve the product and

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,710
then we're delivering it again we're

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,140
working together to do those things and

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,420
so operations when something's in

00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,780
operation it's when it's deployed then

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,400
it is then we need to find out how is it

00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,180
working

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,590
we need to plan together and move that

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,790
you know could be issue creation or plan

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,320
developing it releasing those those

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:08,540
feature requests essentially fixing

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,760
those bugs if we think about it all of

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,880
those characters that were in that

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,180
original linear model if we think about

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,340
them all as one team where we're back to

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:23,200
a very useful topic that I'm not sure

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:27,290
anybody who's encountered before but

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,480
Paul Graham if you search Paul Graham

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,680
maker maker manager schedule we're

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,440
really looking at the distinction

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,930
between a maker and a manager and how

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,580
those two work together so check out

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,630
that it's a very short essay written

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,930
back in July 2009 and this is the idea

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:48,260
where makers to best develop their

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:51,620
products need focus and the people that

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:54,290
are not developing the product can have

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,320
their focus be on on the customer

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:59,720
essentially letting the customer know

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,690
what's what's been delivered to them

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,660
letting the customer know how to use it

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:09,800
best getting feedback from the customer

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,930
on how they're enjoying the product

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,240
that's been delivered to them and then

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,860
bringing that feedback back prioritizing

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,820
it based on what they know about the

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:25,240
customer back into the build stages of

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:27,740
the continuous DevOps model there are

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,270
three things necessary to identify a

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:37,810
DevOps model and that would be flow

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:42,050
feedback and learning so focus and

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:44,780
automation helps with flow rate so if we

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,300
get our internal processes or maybe our

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,570
Kanban boards are set up just right or

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,790
Sprint's are running super smooth and

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,260
we're not interrupting each other with

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,240
too much work in progress we're able to

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,970
focus on good work and we've got this

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,100
we've got terrific automation which we

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,510
have there's there's 10 other DevOps

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,910
talks here about an incredible

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,630
automation tooling and we're able to

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,100
just

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,440
think of something to do or come up with

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,690
something to do do it really quickly and

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,220
just get it right out the door we have

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,250
that capability we have that that

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,440
potential but how do we know that this

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,630
isn't just a feature fire hose on our

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,519
customers that don't really know what

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,680
they're getting they don't really know

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,779
how to use it it's not exactly what they

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,089
wanted how do we know so we need to go

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:30,860
further we need to we need to have

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:35,810
something as part of our way of working

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:38,740
that seeks that feedback and we need to

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:41,930
experiment with what we're producing and

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,639
learn from those experiments to keep

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:47,930
trying to get at a better and a better

00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,269
product for continuous improvement so

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,180
what about so what about the feedback

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:57,380
and learning parts what are we doing

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,420
right now and what can Drupal do what

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,569
can we do with Drupal to focus on

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,639
feedback and learning with our customers

00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:10,399
so imagine a school department and and

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,410
their section of the website what do

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,139
they probably think about the website

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,199
well it probably depends but one common

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:20,990
scenario is they're not quite sure how

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,459
to use it it's overwhelming

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,740
it doesn't always quite do what they

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:27,260
think it's gonna do maybe it's got bugs

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,790
that they work around or maybe worse the

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,060
last person who knew how to use the

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,620
website left for another another job or

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,360
something and no one in the department

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,399
knows how to use the website anymore

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,149
these are these are common scenarios

00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,850
maybe they use WordPress at home and

00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:46,040
they know it works pretty good and it

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,540
works a lot better in their mind than

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,750
the buggy product that they're having to

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,540
use at work do they feel confident in

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,730
their in their product this surely

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,800
affects the value output to the broader

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:03,829
audience and any number of originally

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:06,560
desired outcomes for the organization so

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,480
we need to be thinking about our product

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,130
and our customers experience with the

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,709
product we need to thinkin about Drupal

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,510
and the users of Drupal and their

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,269
experience with the product and what

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,840
more can we do there's a lot more work

00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,170
that we

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,600
do and this is a great this is there's

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,220
great opportunity here

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,240
every time we deliver value with the

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:31,670
product we can inform our users of this

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,200
product what's new right and and if

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,170
we've been in this relationship for a

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,180
while this is a showing of a following

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,400
through of commitments that we listen

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,220
that we fix the bugs we fixed these

00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,470
things or we heard your request for for

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:50,380
these new features and we're delivering

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:53,780
them we can also build into our systems

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:56,090
ways to show our users of the product

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,550
our operators of the product what it is

00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,760
how do you use it is there is there

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,770
enough help is the backend of drupal's

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,420
authoring experience intuitive enough

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,550
helpful enough that people feel

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,650
confident with this as a product that

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,560
they're gonna stay do they feel do the

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:15,260
operators of Drupal feel like a priority

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,570
in the relationship that that we're in

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,190
as developers of Drupal with the users

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,970
of Drupal do they feel like our priority

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:26,300
are they gonna stick around we need to

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,880
be asking how is this going we can build

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,520
in ways to everything that we do to seek

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,100
that feedback if it's a help page we can

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,470
ask was this help page was it helpful if

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,450
it's not how could it have been more

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,890
helpful we need to be seeking that

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,540
feedback and that becomes the source of

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,250
what we want to do next to continuously

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:50,930
improve our product we can also interact

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,070
with our customers to prioritize what's

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:58,120
next so use cases for thinking about

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:02,120
Drupal as a product in this way would be

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:06,260
authors in large government education or

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:10,250
nonprofit organizations where their CMS

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:11,690
of choice is a product that has authors

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,330
that are in their or their organizations

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,430
need to be using it to produce value for

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:25,880
greater organizational desired outcomes

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:27,749
so in these cases Drupal is the product

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,340
that's an operation

00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:33,269
so there's more work to do and great

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,820
opportunity and in the next few slides

00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:39,239
I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,529
some ideas of directions and hopefully

00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:43,570
you all could come up with even better

00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:47,529
ideas because the point of this is not

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,820
to prescribe how should we what exactly

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,889
should we do with Drupal and how should

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,480
we do it to achieve this this is not a

00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:54,399
long enough talk for that really

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,039
let's get thinking about what can we do

00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,809
to do with Drupal to make it a

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,639
continuously improving product that

00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:02,919
people want to stick with that our end

00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:09,789
users are operators of the product on it

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:11,409
I want to stick with so so first what's

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:14,710
new let's think about communicating

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:17,200
what's new with our users of our product

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,059
of a Drupal with each delivery there are

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,369
ways that we can do this and streamline

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:26,499
this into our workflow here's a familiar

00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:29,889
screen I just logged in but what well

00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:32,350
why is this still like this this gets

00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:34,690
customized right and you know it's in

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,269
and it's nice that Drupal hasn't made

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,230
too many decisions for us but there

00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:42,279
could I think there could be a

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:45,249
reasonable default one idea is that we

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:48,070
just let people know what's new welcome

00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:50,590
John here are the bugs we fixed here are

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,559
the updates that were applied I don't

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:56,679
think it's too far off the mark to

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,149
include release notes in the bits of

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,269
work that we do on our custom modules

00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:03,399
and our in our featured and you know for

00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:09,059
update a feature it wouldn't be too much

00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:12,159
work either you're a developer and you

00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,480
know that the the groundwork is in place

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,220
for something like this and wouldn't be

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,529
too hard to do or you're not the

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,989
developer and this might strike you as a

00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:22,029
good idea to say hey I think my Drupal

00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:24,759
site should do something like this or I

00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:27,999
want a way to tell the authors of my

00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,879
product what new cool work we're doing

00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:33,789
we listened and we fixed it and then

00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:36,429
below that at the bottom maybe we could

00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:37,430
have something useful like frequently

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,670
used content

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,620
helpful information but up above that as

00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,820
an example of maybe something that you

00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,340
might have added to your site that you

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,920
want your users to know about and maybe

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,690
you could have a little link in there to

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,020
take a tour about this new content type

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:58,270
that we added and anybody use the Tor

00:20:54,020 --> 00:21:03,530
module for anything tor is in Drupal 8

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:05,540
core it's available it's it's worth

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,970
looking into there's also a tor user

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,170
interface module that will help you

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,910
create tours last call media has also

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,560
done some work that we'll be

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:19,120
contributing back soon that that allows

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:23,290
you to use tor a little bit more

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,790
elegantly and in more diverse situations

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,910
but one thing out of the box you can do

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:32,660
a tour after you create one is you can

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:35,690
go to the URL that it's configured for

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,640
and add question mark tor at the end and

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,250
that will auto start the tour that

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,790
you've configured so you can have links

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,290
to places on the website that someone

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,750
would go to use functionality but you

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,910
can trigger the tour to start so anytime

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,710
you want to link somebody somewhere that

00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,590
you have a tour built to show them

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,030
what's new on this page you can build

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:00,860
that into the you into the user

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:03,740
authoring experience so in terms of

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,690
DevOps and it's and what identifies

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,760
something as DevOps we're thinking about

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:13,280
flow feedback and learning tour is built

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,750
out of Hamel files so that means that

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,220
you can build it into the flow of the

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,880
features that you're developing and

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,740
adding tour tips or adding tours can

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,540
become part of the acceptance criteria

00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,210
of a new feature that you're developing

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,240
so not only are we building this new

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,190
feature but hey we know that this is a

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,810
new feature that the customers want here

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,670
and maybe it's not even built yet but

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,370
here's what we will want to say to them

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,950
when it is built so make sure that

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,550
before we deploy this that the yamo file

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:46,460
gets created or added to this content

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,350
and so on deployment this tour gets

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,350
updated and so that information can flow

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,110
we've automated you can

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,330
automate the flow of that information

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:58,270
you can ask for feedback on tours tours

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:00,820
tour tips allow HTML so you can put an

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,799
HTML link to a survey that you're asking

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,169
like was this tool useful any sort of

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,900
Drupal thing that you can do you can you

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:10,840
can hook it up there and we can

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,669
certainly learn from that so this is a

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,350
tor tip that pops up in the center of

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:17,350
the page that's a configuration option

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,700
and maybe you said hey we just added

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,470
this new content type here's what

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,559
specifically knew about this content

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,360
type let's take the tour you get a tip

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:31,809
for maybe one of the most important

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:34,659
fields and on this tip we can just

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,640
imagine that maybe there's a help page

00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:41,620
of longer form content to help with this

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,419
and we can link out to that see where it

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,100
says read page help so maybe there's

00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:47,530
some help on this maybe maybe this field

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,570
is very complex and there's a lot of

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,220
content strategy behind this field and

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,390
we want to give our authors an

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,059
opportunity to learn a little bit more

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:59,110
to become better authors and produce

00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:00,520
better content so this will lead into

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,350
the next thing that we can consider

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,110
doing with Drupal which is basically

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:07,150
telling our authors what is this product

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,210
that they're using and how can they best

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:12,850
use it we by providing contextual guides

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,820
all over we can put them all over Drupal

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:18,010
links to our our guides and produce help

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,530
content to make sure that they really

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,470
know how they're using the product what

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:26,320
what a beautiful thing this is we can

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:31,000
get budget for it and do it it would be

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:36,549
so great so this is that tip this is

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,340
read read page help the author in this

00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:43,059
example decides I'm gonna go for that

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:47,350
here's a piece of page help for the for

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:50,049
the basic page and you can see it's got

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,110
the title here's here's a basic page

00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:56,440
help a little subtitle some intro copy

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,419
and then below it it's got a description

00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,789
of the

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,669
of a couple of important fields so you

00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,950
can take some time this is obviously a

00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:10,279
very basic example but I'm sure many of

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:13,019
you have very complicated content types

00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,700
and this is the help text field that's

00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,629
in all of your Drupal installs anyway

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,369
how many people use this not many some

00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:23,639
people can provide helpful information

00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:26,369
but what if you could provide even more

00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:29,009
information longer form help content on

00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:30,869
each on each field let's see where this

00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:31,379
goes right it would it would show up

00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:35,519
there

00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:37,440
but how can we why not why not get it to

00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,809
show there but how can we smooth this

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,959
out automate this make this DevOps e

00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:45,329
alright I will point out that the help

00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:47,190
text on the fields fields are that micro

00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:48,989
feature there on the micro feature level

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,079
and if we can make it part of our build

00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:53,399
flow to add and update these that with

00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,109
this information and deploy it with

00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:57,869
everything else then we've really

00:25:55,109 --> 00:26:01,619
streamlined and automated the updating

00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:05,909
of our help pages if we can get it to go

00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:09,509
in there so let's say that we were to

00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:12,299
edit this help page it might look

00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:18,059
something like this where it's got a

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:22,979
title it's hard to see it's got a

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:24,929
subtitle right here we could make all of

00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:26,700
this information pull from its related

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,979
content type if we can relate this

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,469
content to the content type then Drupal

00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:34,559
knows what the description of a content

00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:36,209
type is it knows what feels it has and

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,969
it will know what longer-form help

00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:41,519
content that it has and so we can have

00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:43,349
these auto-generated help pages we can

00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,139
also display this content in different

00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:48,469
ways this could be a teaser of a help

00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:52,139
content page coming from the same

00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:54,629
information where we have a key

00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:56,339
components field down here we have an

00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:59,789
image field maybe of what the page would

00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:02,669
look like and then the related content

00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:04,440
type can drive the other fields even the

00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:06,450
create a basic page button it knows what

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,089
content types it is for why not provide

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,460
a button to create it so let's carry

00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:12,750
this even further

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,190
what could be useful for that teaser

00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:19,470
view of that help page will remember

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:22,200
this page add content but what about

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,390
this page a page that's a view of help

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,910
page teasers you're using the power of

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,010
Drupal this is a grid view of those help

00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,920
page teasers you've built this up

00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,240
automatically fed from all of the help

00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,010
text that you're building into your

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,630
future development just flowing through

00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,850
staying updated with every new feature

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,040
every tweak if you're keeping your help

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,410
text updated all this stuff is staying

00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,120
in sync and this view is driving this

00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,190
new add content page for a better

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,450
authoring experience where they feel

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:55,650
like they're really being taken care of

00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:57,179
so what else alright so these things you

00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,470
can further K you know it's just content

00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:00,660
at this point now you've just put this

00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,240
abstraction layer of content overtop of

00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,390
your of your of your content types in

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,950
this example and you could add any sort

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,070
of feedback mechanism the same way you'd

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,140
add feedback to mechanisms to any node

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,490
so so what else

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,770
remember this page does anybody ever

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,510
gone here to get help you click the Help

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,130
button and you get something that looks

00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,250
like this this is Drupal's current help

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:27,030
system well if we did go with this idea

00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:29,100
of having help be content tied to

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,600
content types or tied to other things we

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,870
could create also create other help

00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,210
pages it's just help content we could

00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,650
have light we can have a Help Center we

00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,510
can build out our tours we can have a

00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,100
collection of tours we could have

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,350
recommended help if we have multiple

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,300
users giving feedback you know the most

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,250
popular help could be there we could be

00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,960
saving help with some sort of

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,559
bookmarking functionality that Drupal

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,090
has has a functionality for you case you

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,440
could just add a block here if you

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,090
wanted your authors to be able to

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,830
contact you for support since it's just

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,360
content you could organize it by topic

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,640
and add additional help pages you could

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,309
really just help your users and get

00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,870
feedback from them along the way so you

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,630
want to make sure to gather feedback on

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,250
the usefulness of our guidance we want

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,050
to know was it helpful we want it to

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,059
improve so we have that there's endless

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,030
numbers of options in Drupal to do that

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:24,250
I would say

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:26,290
with that and we would use that to

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,810
collect feature requests and bug reports

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:32,850
and this becomes the what's next that

00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:36,160
we're going to do with our product and

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:38,440
all of this is to build the culture of

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,170
closeness in an open collaboration

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,880
between the developers of a product and

00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:48,130
the operators of a product developing

00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,760
soft a software product is complex yet

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,070
flexible this means the closer the

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,630
operators are to the developers the

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,850
shorter the feedback loops can be in the

00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,270
better the product will become or set a

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:03,580
shorter way when change is easy

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,950
awareness fuels improvement a product is

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:08,140
a relationship anyone who's been in a

00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,630
good relationship for a while knows it

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,350
needs to be a priority we need to be

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:16,510
continuously listening and improving

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:18,490
when the relationship is a product we

00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:21,430
need everyone's perspective to make our

00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,410
product as intuitive as possible and our

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,670
the operators of our product are using

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,590
it every day the customers are

00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,410
experiencing it every day what a better

00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:35,650
source of feedback and information to

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:37,090
improve our product with so if you if

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:41,070
you make a product and you're feeling

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:45,010
distant from your customers get closer

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:47,740
do this start your courageous journey of

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:50,140
openness and collaboration to share in a

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,530
focus on your commitments to

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:57,130
continuously improve your product if you

00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,200
do this your customers will get closer

00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,560
to you

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:09,710
thank you

00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:10,910
I don't know when the next session

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:16,360
starts does anybody know in the next

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:16,360
session starts 2 minutes for questions

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:27,740
yes there's a microphone - so I haven't

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,680
got a chance to work with the Tor module

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,830
well I have a quick question is this

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,570
module has an API or something which we

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:39,080
can integrate with custom content

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:41,690
entities you would the way that it works

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:47,540
right now is you build a gamo file that

00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:50,030
has a tour that you're defining and a

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:52,550
location in Drupal where it's supposed

00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:56,210
to show up and then you also define each

00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:59,060
tip in in the ammo file and you target

00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:01,010
like a CSS class or an ID and you put

00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,640
them in order in the file and when the

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:08,120
tour is triggered it just shows each tip

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:10,160
pointing at the CSS the target and it

00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,090
just and it shows the HTML inside the

00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:17,240
tip that's that's it ok sounds like then

00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,270
I have to try that Rigas yeah all right

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,270
