Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Getting closer to your customer: Using Drupal in the last mile
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	With all of the advances in DevOps, it is easy to focus on delivering more, faster, as our important measures of success. However, DevOps is as much about listening as it is about delivering. How do we know we are delivering the right things? How are we informing our customers of this work and getting their feedback effectively?

If our project is using Drupal, it usually ends up being operated by the end users being delivered to. With Drupal being so close to the customer in production, we can use all of its powers to leverage new feedback loops and truly measure our success by customer satisfaction. 

In this talk we'll look at using Drupal:

to communicate "What's New/Fixed" to our Drupal end users with each delivery
provide our end users contextual guides and resources on site features
to gather feedback on the usefulness of our guidance
to collect feature requests and bug reports
Ultimately we'll look at how Drupal, as a CMS, fits into a DevOps mindset, fully closing the loop between what's developed and what's in operation.

Attendees of any level of experience will walk away with ideas for using Drupal to get closer to their customers and continuously improve their product.
