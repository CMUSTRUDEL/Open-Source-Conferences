Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Drupal 8, where did the code go? From info hook to plugin.
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Looking at core and contributed modules for Drupal 8, you may be wondering "where did the code go?".

Drupal 8 has removed many of the "info" hooks that were found in your module file and converted them to plugins.

This session will be a practical discussion of how plugins work and how to upgrade your module to Drupal 8 if it used one of these hooks that's been converted to a plugin. I will include example of code from Drupal 7 and where the very similar code lives in Drupal 8.

In addition I'll cover the essentials of implementing your own plugin if your module previously used an "info" hook and you want to join the new paradigm. You'll come away understanding plugin terminology and different ways plugins can be discovered,

Finally, you will leave feeling good that you'll never again implement one of these hooks by mistake again when you're writing a function in your module.
