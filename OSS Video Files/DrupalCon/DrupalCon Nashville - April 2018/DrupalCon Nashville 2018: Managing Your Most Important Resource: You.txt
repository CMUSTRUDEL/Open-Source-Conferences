Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Managing Your Most Important Resource: You
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	The Drupal community is extremely large, diverse, and established, and lately, we’ve started to grow beyond our own codebase.  For new members to the community, even the slack channels and issue queues can be daunting, but rooted community members such as myself also have a hard time finding our place.

There are pressures to contribute back to the community, both extrinsic and intrinsic, that can drive us to burnout.  I’ve been trying to find my place for over 10 years.  These are some of the lessons I’ve learned along the way:

Don’t try to be a rockstar for the sake of being a rockstar.
Don’t let guilt be your driving factor.
Not everyone speaks English as a first language.
Take care of yourself first.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Help someone.
There are many more, but these seem to be the overarching tenets.  I’d like to share my lessons with you and help you clear a path for yourself, both in the Drupal community and out.  I'll talk about my journey over the last decade, how to navigate the excitement that the community evokes, how to reclaim your time and find your passion, and how that may fit in the community.

This session is appropriate for any person of any demographic, and any skill level of any job role.

so hi everybody thanks for taking the

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,700
first half of your lunch to hang out

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,360
here with me

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,309
I appreciate that my name is Chris

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,469
Albrecht I'm a senior developer at la

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,780
la' but I also host the behind the

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,340
screens podcast which was largely

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:23,910
derived from the things I'm going to

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:25,800
tell you about today so a little bit

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,939
about my company because I'd be remiss

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,439
if I didn't mention them they're the

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,710
ones who gave me the opportunity to be

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,710
up here mullah Bhat is a strategy design

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,050
and Drupal development shop mainly with

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,000
large scale digital publishers we've

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,750
worked with a lot of clients like MSNBC

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,800
Martha Stewart sci-fi Bravo lots of

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,469
great stuff like that but at Lullaby we

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,030
have some really fantastic core values I

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,550
feel very privileged to work for this

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,350
company and if you ask anybody at the

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,120
company which one of these six is at the

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,350
top of their list it's always this one

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,680
be human and I think it's it's very rare

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,540
in a tech company to have being human as

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,189
the top of your list in the industry it

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,189
can be really easy to lose that notion

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,979
that we are human that were actual

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,590
people with lives kids jobs behind

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,170
everything we tend to build personas

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,390
around people based on what we see in

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,119
the issue queue or on Twitter or any

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,229
social media blog posts and we form

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,240
these images of people that don't

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,600
accurately represent them or their

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,680
project or who they are so I think it's

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,070
very important to remember that the

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,659
community is is made up of people and we

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,700
all came from the same place at the

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,649
beginning so I've been in the community

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,170
for over a decade now

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,450
and I've had my struggles I've had

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,070
successes I've had failures I've had

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,649
excitement I've had burnout

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,950
I've even second-guessed career choices

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,409
even somewhat recently it's sometimes

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,530
it's not easy in the community but so

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,149
recently I I took a really good look at

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,130
my personal life in my professional life

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,159
and I decided I needed to make a few

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,159
changes

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,730
some improvements if you will so what

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,780
I'm gonna talk to you about today is

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,769
first my user story the time I spent

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,950
navigating the Drupal community over the

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:23,400
last decade how I debug some of these

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,890
issues that I was dealing with balancing

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,480
that load of all the responsibilities

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,920
and excitement and fun things we tend to

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,610
find at these conferences and throughout

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,430
the community throughout our jobs reap

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,500
lat forming how I sort of shifted some

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,239
behaviors in my life and some of the

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,410
tools I use to make these improvements

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,670
to really figure things out for myself

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,170
but before I get too far into all that

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,819
how many people here you're at your

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:53,400
first Drupal con wow that's like half

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,260
excellent all right who here has

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
attended at least a local Drupal camp or

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,750
some sort of meetup or something like

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,220
that so you've had some experience in

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,980
the community almost everybody that's

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,819
awesome how many people have just only

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:09,720
used Drupal for less than a year so far

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:11,609
Wow nobody oh one maybe half so you're

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,040
very new into it exit so we got like a

00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,810
good range going that's amazing um well

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,260
before that how many more than ten years

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,549
a few okay good we've got a pretty big

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,769
range then how many people here are

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,160
developers back back in front-end in the

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,650
code

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,329
okay how about non developers you'd be

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,359
designers project managers something

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,220
okay good split there too awesome and

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:33,569
how many people here have contributed to

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,609
the community in some way that could be

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,889
writing code documentation mentoring

00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:39,000
somebody providing translations it's

00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,049
like everybody's got a little bit

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,459
they're bent that's fantastic

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:48,480
so whoops that's one too far so my story

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,620
in the community I'm gonna take you

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,019
through that and some of the lessons I

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,959
learned as I went through so my first

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,480
job in tech was with a very small

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,040
company or a very small team I should

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,720
say within that company and we were

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,380
working on a homegrown CMS this was

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,359
before Drupal 5 came out we weren't on

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,019
Drupal yet it was all just a mangled

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:12,150
mess of code so my experience in the

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,010
tech industry was still very limited all

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,560
I knew was what I got from that team so

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,209
I had no idea of the ecosystem that was

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,070
around the community the resources that

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,840
were out there as Stack Overflow was

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,970
still a few years away even so like

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,030
googling an answer was he still weren't

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:30,210
quite sure what you were gonna get so it

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,150
was about Drupal 5.2 when it came out in

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,440
July of 2007 that my company decided

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,000
that was where we were gonna go we were

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,729
gonna shift and re-platform onto Drupal

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,240
so that's how I got started there and I

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:44,430
was very lucky that I had a fantastic

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,830
mentor on that team who Drupal was new

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,210
to him as well but he understood the way

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,590
those things work and was able to slap

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,719
my wrist when I decided I was gonna try

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,700
and change something in core we all know

00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:59,370
you don't touch core I learned that

00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:00,930
lesson real quick so I realized if you

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,430
wanted to change the functionality and

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,870
change something in triple what do you

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,430
do write a module for it you plug it in

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,469
so I decided I needed to learn how to

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,450
write modules so I started looking at

00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:14,190
what modules were out there if I wanted

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,650
to make something happen on my website

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,659
what could I install to make it work and

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,370
so I started looking through the project

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:22,289
pages on drupal.org and you start to

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,000
find the common names that pop up all

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,729
over the place the Dave Reid's thérèse

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,200
web chick eaten quick sketch I've wrote

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,969
a few of them down here Merlin of Chaos

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,409
circuitry most like those those are just

00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,729
a few but those are the ones that stick

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:33,810
out and I think if you've been around

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,719
for a little while you know most of

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:40,020
those names these are the Drupal experts

00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:42,960
they build Drupal so they were the upper

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,090
echelon to me and I knew coding was my

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,469
thing I loved creating the backend stuff

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,870
and learning how all that worked

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:51,000
so I decided that's my career I wanted

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,800
to be like these experts I wanted to be

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,229
the upper echelon it's that's where I

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,620
wanted to go in my career so I wanted to

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:01,289
be a Drupal rock star but I was doing it

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,450
for the wrong reasons though I wanted to

00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:05,669
have that notoriety that sort of fame

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,080
and glory you know to be recognized when

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,969
you go to an event like hey it's it's

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,050
web chick or it's triest it's the guy

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,550
that everybody knows the girl that

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,330
everybody knows they did this they did

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,460
that and the problem with this is that

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,880
that notoriety that Fame and that glory

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,690
that

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,730
expertise that we're seeking that's

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,780
actually a result not a reason and we're

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,910
gonna take a little bit more into that a

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,070
little bit later but so here's my user

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,830
story as a member of the Drupal

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:37,280
community I want to be an expert

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,860
why because experts are rock stars and I

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,100
thought that was the coolest thing and

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:47,270
that's kind of a flawed way of thinking

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:49,480
so first of all what do you take to

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,680
become a rock star what is an expert

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:56,180
expert is the elite right they're the

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,670
best of the best so pretty sure this is

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,800
a direct quote from the movie gentleman

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,900
you're the top 1% of all Drupal

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,300
developers the elite the best of the

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:09,560
best yeah that's actually that it was in

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,840
the movie but just keep an eye on this

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,210
for a second here maverick he might have

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,940
been an expert pilot but he did not

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,170
architect that plane he did not design

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,330
the instrument panel he did not

00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,030
construct it he did not put fuel in it

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,770
and he does not fix it when it breaks he

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,410
is also given very explicit instructions

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,940
when and where to fly it so he may be an

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,680
expert at piloting that plane but there

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,040
is a crew of people who also have

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,800
expertise that give him that that upper

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,120
echelon status that we tend to think of

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,550
so here's the actual definition of what

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,580
an expert is having involving or

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,880
displaying a special skill or knowledge

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,620
derived from training or expertise so

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,690
that's actually starting to sound a

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:55,340
little bit more like this everyone's

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,560
seen the movie right everyone knows Liam

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,350
Neeson's famous speech this is the way

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,000
it was actually written what I do have a

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,800
very particular set of skills skills

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,230
I've acquired over a very long career

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,030
sounds familiar right skills that make

00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,080
me a dream for clients like you actually

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,190
I wrote the rest of this because I

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,320
thought it was funny so I'm gonna read

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,430
it I thought some going on very little

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,789
sleep right now so you'll have to

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,470
indulge me

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,180
if you let my agency go now that'll be

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,770
the end of it I will not look for you I

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,689
will not pursue you but if you don't I

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:29,650
will look for you I will find you and I

00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:31,150
will bill you yeah so that's that so an

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,159
expert having involving or displaying a

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,130
special skill or knowledge derived from

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:40,029
training or experience how many people

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,860
here are currently at DrupalCon all

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:46,380
right some of you are still not quite

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:48,670
awake how many people have used Drupal

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,190
all right that sounds like training and

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,980
that sounds like experience to me so

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,420
there's a few very important pieces that

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,350
are missing from this definition when

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,910
you think about it now don't mean

00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,459
missing like they should be there but we

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,940
should be aware that they're not there

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:06,550
those two things there is no time frame

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,430
involved in that definition nor is there

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,630
a ranking involved in that definition no

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,180
where does it say to be an expert you

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:15,610
must have 10,000 hours of experience or

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,279
that you must be the top 1% of your

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,310
like-minded peers so the next time you

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:23,670
hear that expert word think about what

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,010
it actually means

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,740
it also doesn't change by the company

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,449
that you're in if I'm talking to my mom

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,170
about building websites I am definitely

00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:38,440
the Drupal expert if I am talking to

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:41,709
Angie Byron about building websites I am

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,620
still a Drupal expert she may work for

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:46,060
Driessen aqua at the very top she may

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,589
have been around longer than I have she

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,449
may know more about how things work in

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:51,190
core than I do but that doesn't make me

00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,140
any less of a developer or any less of

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,380
an expert we just have different skill

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,380
sets

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:03,040
so don't let those loaded terms get in

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,890
the way and I'd like I'd like to take a

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,380
moment just to recommend this talk my

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,610
coworker Juan Alya gave this speech or

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,740
they gave this presentation in Vienna

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,900
and he couldn't make it this week

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,220
so I shorten the URL there for you but

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,290
you can also find it just by googling

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,820
DrupalCon Vienna breaking the myths of

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,170
the rock star developer it's one of

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,670
those terms we throw around wanting to

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,170
be a rock star who are the rock star

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,400
developers there is the names you

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,950
recognize immediately when you go

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,480
anywhere and he breaks all those myths

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,590
down in a very very humbling like I'm

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,630
trying to get the right words to explain

00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,010
it it's an excellent talk so I highly

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,590
recommend that if you've ever felt that

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,150
sense of imposter syndrome or want to

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,540
get a good feel for what what the

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:45,370
community is made out the people at it

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,950
so let's talk a bit about debugging so

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,020
these experts at the beginning they were

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,520
always encouraging and controlling

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,040
everyone to give back to the community

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,520
to the point where it started to feel

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,830
like an obligation to me and with a

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,950
sense I'm making my living off of free

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,150
code written by everybody else so in the

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,100
back of my mind I have that pressure

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,930
like well I'm I'm getting all this stuff

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,200
out of it I need to give something back

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,970
and I distinctly remember instances

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,110
where they were telling us just give

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,490
what you've got put it up there it

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,680
doesn't matter how good it is or what it

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,120
is put your code up you get the

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,460
community that way somebody else can

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,710
work on it and add patches somebody else

00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,240
can review it for security updates or

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,950
for bugs and can fix it for you so you

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,790
leverage the power of the community by

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,980
putting your stuff out there and so I

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,110
decided that I need to start writing

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,650
modules that's how I'm giving back I

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,970
need to do this turns out everything I

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:44,040
actually wanted to do there was already

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:46,390
a module for it even ten years ago

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,670
although modules had already been taken

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,380
so I was I started searching out an idea

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,600
for something I could write a module

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,580
about it could be some problem I could

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,290
solve most of them were for somebody

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,520
else they'd not necessarily something I

00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,840
needed at the time but I had to write a

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,770
module and I had to contribute it and

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,360
put it up on ddoddo so I started writing

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,180
code for some of these ideas that I got

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,060
and I had these big grand plans for them

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,620
these elegant new eyes and this super

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,780
functionality and ever me like I want

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:18,550
the module that that guy wrote and then

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:21,520
I had three big blockers in the way when

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:25,450
we got through that the first one of

00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,070
those is talent I would often run into

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,770
something I had no idea how to do in

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,540
Drupal so like what is what is the right

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,710
way there's so many ways to do things in

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,040
your blur I didn't even know how to

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,420
approach some of these challenges so

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,980
ultimately I would get stuck in these

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,330
things I didn't want to bother people in

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,650
the issue you know and responded on the

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,580
forums that really started to play with

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:47,260
my confidence which is the second issue

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,910
be everything would have to be perfect

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,500
for me before I felt good about putting

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,630
it out there had to be bug free the code

00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,380
had to be perfectly clean and I didn't

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,790
want it to get out there and have a

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,520
developer review it and throw it back at

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,290
me like you have to do this and this and

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,400
reject it you have to clean up your code

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,920
why didn't you do this we don't have

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,320
time to do this we're working on core

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,910
all these voices in my head aren't

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,310
telling me you're not good enough to do

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,690
this and then I started thinking what if

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,970
it actually does get in and then someone

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,850
posts an issue or bug into the issue

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,260
queue I have no idea how to fix it but

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,850
what if it somebody installs it and it

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,400
breaks their site and it's my fault

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,050
I mean so luckily I'm the only one who's

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,770
ever had these fears so you guys don't

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:33,280
have to worry about that and finally

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,540
there was this issue of time and you'll

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,220
notice that doesn't exactly match up

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,690
with the picture because they're pretty

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,210
much synonymous time and money in this

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,710
case as I started working through my

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,290
career I started freelancing and I felt

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:47,010
really guilty about creating a module

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,060
that I could put up into the contribs

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,040
didn't need to be to take that extra

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,330
time and charge my clients for that time

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,430
when I could just come up with a quick

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,130
custom solution for them I didn't feel

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,560
like that was fair to them but at the

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,260
same time I didn't have time to do it on

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,700
my own you know lost time has lost money

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,910
and I was barely paying the bills so

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,160
that time that I had leftover was

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,350
working a second job or just trying to

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,150
relaxing it on my head for a minute so I

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,290
started having these thoughts what why

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,800
would I do this if I'm not getting paid

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,200
for it

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,220
or if I wait long enough somebody else

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
will develop the module and they'll do a

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,530
better job at it

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,460
we just yeah not altogether untrue but

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,470
who knows if they would do a better job

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,590
and then there was always that dreaded

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,600
issue queue I've seen threads in

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,030
comments miles long and I didn't have

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,920
time to get into all of that and these

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,450
reasons caused me to abandon a lot of

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,590
potential contributed modules that I

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,710
could have put up that somebody else

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,270
could have gotten some use out of so it

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,160
took some time but finally I was able to

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,830
break through that and I was able to

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,550
have this mental shift I was fortunate

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,930
enough to find a more permanent job

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,630
where somebody actually showed me that I

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,460
had far more talent than I thought I did

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,170
and was able to break down this first

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,190
barrier for me these are the blockers

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,260
that were stuck in my mind I don't know

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,520
the talent to build a module they showed

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,740
me that I did and then I could actually

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,510
lead a team and it blew me away when I

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:13,190
was given that opportunity to find that

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:15,410
in myself in so in 2001 or do I'm sorry

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,150
2011 four years after I started in

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,950
Drupal I was actually able to get my

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,630
first module up into the contribs pace

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,830
it wasn't great but it solved the

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,450
problem for what we needed to do with

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:29,180
this job so that broke down my my second

00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,530
barrier I'm actually doing something and

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:36,830
people are using it and thanking me for

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:37,970
it it was amazing and that job also gave

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,980
me a little bit of freedom because it

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,600
was a salary job to work on these

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,640
controls and put them up there for other

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,520
people because the my boss actually saw

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,350
the value in sharing this with other

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,090
members of the we had multiple

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,500
departments in this company but other

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,390
people in that company could use those

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,310
modules and she she knew what it meant

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,170
to put open-source code back up into the

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,390
community so she let me work on those

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,190
and contribute those so she broke down

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,230
my third barrier for me as well now I'm

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,280
actually making money and being able to

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,920
contribute these modules to the

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:11,600
community so a word on confidence here

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,370
is really easy to succumb to impostor

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,280
syndrome I think we've probably all felt

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,900
that at some point that feeling that we

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,940
just don't belong somewhere that we're

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,580
not right for this

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,460
we're not talented enough to participate

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,500
that we haven't been here long enough to

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,020
have any clout that our work isn't as

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,840
valuable as somebody else's work I know

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,060
I've had those feelings before

00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,650
and they're wrong they're absolutely

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,390
wrong and I heard this quote recently

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,510
and I've been just taking it with me

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,730
everywhere it seems to pop up it's not

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,520
who you are that's the problem it's who

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,260
you think that you're not and just think

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,480
on that one for a second I absolutely

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,270
love this quote it every time I start to

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,350
feel a little mmm maybe I'm doing this

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,880
wrong or I'm not good enough

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:59,950
this quote always sends me back the

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,030
right direction so for me it finally it

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,410
felt good to finally be able to give

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,870
something back to be a contributing

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,110
member of the community and it turns out

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:12,190
I can be a contributor after all who

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,930
knew now all of this was a big changing

00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,790
point my life but it didn't come without

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,050
its price so now the pressure wasn't to

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,270
give back but it was to try and maintain

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,800
that so now I'm an open-source

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,430
maintainer I have projects up on

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,320
drupal.org so I began contributing more

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,670
modules most of them were rarely used

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,650
they were kind of nice for what we were

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,960
doing but they were useful for us and

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,520
for a few other people now most of them

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,930
are out there and have really stale

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,510
issues because I don't need them anymore

00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,890
and I felt sorry I feel really bad that

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,270
I haven't been able to keep up with the

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,530
contributed modules I've gotten our

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,750
issue queues so it can kind of feel like

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,130
you sign a contract when you put

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,400
something out there be it on drupal.org

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,470
or github or anywhere else if it's an

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,030
open source project that you want your

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,500
intention is hopefully somebody else can

00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,300
use this and then the issue queue starts

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,880
filling up and hopefully they're full of

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,070
constructive comments or useful issues

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,840
and not this project is crap you totally

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,900
screwed this up I actually don't think

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,490
I've seen really any of that I think

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,950
we're pretty good as a community in

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,340
Drupal to be supportive of those types

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,440
of things but still they feel like more

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,210
obligations and what if you're not using

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,650
that module anymore I think the things I

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,780
built that were niche for that time do I

00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,490
spend my time fixing issues and patching

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,370
things that people have submitted have

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,720
worked on for me if I'm not even using

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,580
that module like I've got to go spin up

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
an old instance of d7 and install the

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,400
other modules that go with it and test

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,060
it out and see if it works like takes a

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,190
lot of extra time so I was starting to

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,879
get a little anxiety and burnt out about

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,769
that

00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:45,389
so eventually I stopped putting modules

00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,460
up on drupal.org again I've got a

00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:48,779
handful out there still and I every once

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,220
in a while if I find one that I think is

00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:52,679
gonna be ubiquitous enough I'm not gonna

00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,899
lose it or forget about it then I'll

00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,970
I'll put it up there but a lot of them I

00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:58,049
just leave in the proprietary stack that

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,809
we're building when the code base we're

00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,830
building I just I don't have that there

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,779
there are some people who have that

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,159
passion to be that open-source

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,830
maintainer and they really thrive on

00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,409
that and I enjoy it to a degree but it's

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,840
not I don't think it was right for me

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:13,919
so maybe code contribution wasn't the

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,240
right way to give back for me so I

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,399
decided I was gonna look at some other

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,110
options and try and change my mindset

00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:22,980
about where I fit in a Drupal community

00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,360
so now this is only a few years ago but

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,519
I was giving back for the right reasons

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,710
now I feel like I actually had something

00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,480
valuable to share maybe code

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,909
contribution wasn't it but throughout

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,830
the lifecycle of d7 I became a really

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:36,720
good architect and back-end developer

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,700
and I feel confident saying that not in

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,960
a bragging away but I feel confident my

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,869
skills that I was good enough to do that

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,519
so I thought where where can I apply

00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:46,919
this can I give something back from that

00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,749
maybe I can write how-to articles on how

00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,440
to use a module or how to set up a

00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:54,210
system using panels or I can creates or

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,909
come up with some sessions to present a

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,379
Drupal con so I did I proposed sessions

00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,840
and they weren't accepted I didn't have

00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:02,460
a lot of speaking experience at the time

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:08,159
or there were a lot of other sessions

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:09,720
about the same topic and I started a lot

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,730
of those articles those how-to articles

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,340
and got like three-quarters of the way

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,539
through and just got tired of it I had

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,759
that feeling like by the time I actually

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,649
finished this is gonna be outdated the

00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,269
next versions gonna be out so I wasn't

00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:22,440
real keen on spending all that time and

00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:24,360
work on something that was so ephemeral

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,549
that wasn't going to last or be

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,610
applicable within a few months so that

00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:31,049
burnt out on me - I tried trainings I

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,779
didn't really enjoy creating the course

00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:37,440
material as much as I liked the training

00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:39,539
and then we as much as we'd heard about

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,159
d8 coming out I mean we had like two

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,169
years from the time they announced it

00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,179
that we started creating sessions and

00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:47,129
writing code and testing and teaching

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,499
how to use Drupal 8 before it actually

00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:51,240
hit production ready so we were all

00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,920
geared up for it and then it broke and

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,630
people started using it and there

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,450
Drupal 8 developers now being hired to

00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,520
do these things and I was working at

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,500
lullaby at the time and still on a

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,240
Drupal 7 project for a client I'm still

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,160
on a Drupal 7 project for a client I

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,290
have barely touched a triple head goat

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,790
at this point but when that came out and

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,050
now all the sessions are about Drupal 8

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,610
and everyone's learning how to do this

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,290
and you've played that Drupal 8 and it

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,210
was like the carpet was ripped out from

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,750
under me I feel like I went from the top

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,700
rung to the bottom overnight and I

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,420
remember walking around Drupal con New

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,930
Orleans just lost I didn't have a spark

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:31,440
left it was it was really a really

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,970
strange feeling so I thought I'm not

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,380
touching the Drupal 8 code I'm so far

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,600
behind on that maybe I can find a

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,490
different place and I've tried

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,830
documentation I tried going through the

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,450
mentoring and I enjoy those but I still

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,040
just didn't feel right about it I

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,470
remember coming home from Drupal con so

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,720
many times with my wife calls it Drupal

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,680
itis which I think technically is an

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,140
inflammation of your Drupal I'm not

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,000
crazy about that term so I call a Drupal

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,190
fever but is that you know that idea

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,600
that concept you get so energized at

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,430
these conferences and you want to do all

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,200
of the things you talk to so many

00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,730
different people and they all have some

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,020
fun things to do and they want help and

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,790
there have these new initiatives they're

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,470
pushing or they need this or that and

00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,670
it's all important that's why it speaks

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,940
to you that's why you're interested in

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,540
it

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,390
but you can't do everything at once so

00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,800
that lack of Drupal fever in New Orleans

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,510
really got me thinking about what my

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,490
place was in the community and and

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,560
personally too in my personal life so I

00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,300
began to make some changes to try and

00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,630
reconfigure things because clearly the

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,210
configuration I had was not working out

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:35,340
and I was able to boil that concept of

00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,500
Drupal fever into three distinct

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,940
categories this is where I started and

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,680
you can apply these to any area of life

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,450
not just Drupal but I noticed it mostly

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,820
there because I came out with so much in

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,900
my head so if you're sitting out here

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,130
right now and you're thinking to

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,000
yourself you know what is there to life

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,610
beyond Drupal

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,440
there's lots actually you may want to

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,490
listen up on this part that's a not to

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,680
deter you from what you really like

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,100
doing but this made a big impact in my

00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,110
life

00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,580
does anyone else had that like that

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,750
Drupal fever that like I want to do all

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,770
the things you come out of Drupal con

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,720
and you're like signing up for

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,679
everything instead agreeing to do things

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,960
you know you're not gonna have

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,340
any kind of time to do yeah you know

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,019
what that leads to burn out real quick

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,320
burn out broken promises disappointment

00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:21,509
everything I did you can't do everything

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,710
and do it well so you know the kind of

00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,059
person that when I tell you I'm gonna do

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,580
something I'm gonna follow through with

00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,690
it I can't stand breaking promises to

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,549
people you know if I tell you I'm gonna

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:34,289
be there I'm gonna be there so these

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:37,710
three levels of engagement I call them

00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:39,389
for for coming away from Drupal but

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,600
pretty much anything

00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:45,720
the first one is excitement all of these

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,039
things generate or these events generate

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,369
a big excitement in so many different

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:54,960
areas but there's also interests so you

00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,039
get beyond the excitement and some of

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,169
those things stick around those become

00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,299
your interests but then you find those

00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:01,679
really deep rooted ones those ones that

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,409
speak to you those passions we're gonna

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,119
talk about each one of these so the

00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,999
excitement is the Drupal fever that's

00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,529
that I want to do everything in and help

00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:12,090
everybody out that I talked to a Drupal

00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:15,659
con kind of feeling and you can extend

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:18,450
this like I said beyond just rupal oops

00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:21,080
go back through those

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,419
[Music]

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,220
yeah so when I would walk out the doors

00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:27,559
I had I would always have that really

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:31,580
great excitement from DrupalCon

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,899
and even with the best intentions all

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,220
the people that I said yeah I can work

00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:35,539
on this I'm getting to the issue queue

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,730
while I'll help you out with this

00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:40,220
I was not attending the meetings that I

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,779
wanted to I was not grooming the issue

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,580
queues that I promised that I would I

00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,110
wasn't writing a module that could solve

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,600
somebody else's problem and I just

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,159
wasn't happy how could I come away with

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,919
so much positive energy and be so

00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,470
overloaded and depressed that finally I

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,619
realize I needed to give Drupal fever a

00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:59,330
few days to break you let that calm down

00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,149
and some of those items will start to

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:06,440
sift out so those ideas that are left

00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:08,059
over are your interests no it's easy to

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,590
discard some of these things when you

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,970
realize that there are plenty of people

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,499
who will work on it so it's not all

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,639
dependent on you don't worry there the

00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:15,049
group is not gonna be offended if you

00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,489
don't show up even though you said you

00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:21,080
did a lot of people go through the same

00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:23,059
thing others are more important to get

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,269
they're more difficult to get rid of to

00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:28,249
kind of push off your plate to make room

00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:30,679
so once that Drupal fever has sort of

00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:34,429
subsided and a lot of those ephemeral

00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,289
interests of have gone away then you

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:37,639
need to decide whatever is left over is

00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:39,440
that an interest or is that a true

00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:41,299
passion they're both valid so don't

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,309
discard anything right away once you get

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:44,659
to that point but here's how you kind of

00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,379
Whittle that down and figure out where

00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:49,789
to go from there

00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:52,190
so some interests so for me here's a few

00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:53,899
examples I I like playing the guitar I

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,210
like writing code I like architecting

00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:58,519
websites and running talking to in front

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,739
of people yes that's good right now

00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,330
we're how writing about my life

00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:03,919
experience is writing fiction I like

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,440
teaching traveling I like organizing

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,639
things that's a lot of stuff and there's

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,230
no way I'm gonna be able to do all of

00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:13,070
that and actually get anywhere with it

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:16,489
at least not at full strength so the one

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:19,309
resource that we all have in common and

00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:21,950
unfortunately it's non-renewable and

00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:25,389
it's finite is time and it takes time to

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:28,909
invest the energy in those things so you

00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:30,409
need to evaluate those interests and

00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:33,499
figure out where you want to put that

00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:36,499
time where is the energy best of

00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:39,350
I actually had a college professor I'll

00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:40,759
never forget this it was my first

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,480
semester of college I was on my way to

00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:47,990
addy in graphic design its back-end

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,509
developer and he told me and you know

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:52,129
towards the end of the class first he

00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,299
asked me we you know do you mind if I

00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:54,649
tell you something about yourself so

00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:57,049
right away I knew something was coming

00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:59,690
but I told him okay yeah go ahead he

00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,730
said you're the kind of person who will

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,039
be good at anything but you will never

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,600
be great at anything or good at

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,629
everything but you'll never be great at

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,090
anything and as an eighteen year old

00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:13,820
first semester in college my first

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:16,340
thought was how dare you I you know I'm

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,929
invincible what are you talking about

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,360
but he was right I realized immediately

00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,559
after that thought he was right I'd been

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,539
that way my whole life as soon as

00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,799
something got too hard I could jump to

00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:27,200
another interest because I was pretty

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,210
good at it so I could enjoy all of those

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,559
different things and I never actually

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:35,419
got deep into anything so I believed

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,509
that for years and that's why I never

00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:39,470
was able to really find anything but

00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:40,220
some of these tools that I'm gonna show

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,059
you and some of the things I'm gonna

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,710
talk about really they changed my

00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,659
perspective on things and I figured out

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,309
how to sacrifice some of the things that

00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:51,320
were less important or that were just

00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,820
the interest and prioritize those that I

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,470
could actually find those passions and

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,940
now I've decided I'm going to be great

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,960
at something I have that confidence to

00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,779
do it and I know how to find it so a

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,789
passion what is a passion it's that

00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:08,119
feeling that like you feel it burning in

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:09,289
your heart it's when hours pass by and

00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,340
you don't even realize it it feels like

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,749
minutes like how many people have

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,610
actually looked out the window after

00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:18,350
coding and realized oh crap the sun's

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:20,659
coming up yeah that's it's when that

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,820
happens when you forget to eat or sleep

00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:25,159
while you're doing it it's like it's

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,809
like being in love with an idea when

00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,869
you're not doing it that's all you want

00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:31,039
to do it charges you up here's the big

00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:33,289
determiner here's the question to ask

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,899
yourself if you're not sure you've got

00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:38,960
to love the process as much as you love

00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:41,870
the product you have to love

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,169
the part that gets you to the end the

00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,429
means to the end as well as just the end

00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,720
when I figured that part out

00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:50,960
I realize looking back on some of these

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,330
things that that was my big that was the

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,620
part that I was missing

00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,360
so those that helped me determine which

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,330
pieces I needed to just set aside as

00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,980
interest and which ones I wanted to

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,799
actually dive into and pursue and really

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,870
get good at and I think many of us here

00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,809
are here because we have a passion for

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:14,690
what we do as well as being here for the

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:16,850
work so a few examples we'll go through

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,230
these kind of quickly here but so I

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,210
really like to play the guitar did

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,059
anyone see the pre note ending here for

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,260
that one or two people so okay whew no

00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:27,500
one wants to admit it like it we saw you

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,270
don't make us talk about it yeah I've

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,630
been playing for about 15 years and

00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:36,049
that's about as good as it gets but I

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,970
don't I like to play for me you know

00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:40,130
I've never officially taken lessons I'm

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,159
self-taught from the internet it was fun

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,289
for me to just sort of zone out for a

00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,700
little while and play okay my my

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:49,159
fundamentals are not so good my

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,679
techniques okay but it's relaxing for me

00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,909
but at one point recently I decided I

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,169
wanted to get good enough to like start

00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:56,330
playing coffee shops to get up on stage

00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,860
somewhere so I took some lessons I

00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,510
actually paid for them and I really

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,090
tried to buckle down and improve my

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,549
fundamentals and you know practicing

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:08,450
scales and patterns and progressions and

00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,850
I just didn't enjoy that so I realized I

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,470
wasn't in love with the process as much

00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,909
as I was the product I was perfectly

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,159
happy still I am perfectly happy just

00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:17,480
taking five ten minutes here there and

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,520
putting something together and even just

00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,840
has an interest like do it on the side

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,909
or a little bit of free time when I want

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,580
to change my pace I can still be good

00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:26,899
enough well to get up on stage I can say

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,230
I played guitar on a stage in Nashville

00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:32,779
that's kind of cool so I'm okay with

00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,840
that I've decided that is my interest

00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:36,590
that goes on the side for right now so I

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,090
mean if you're passionate about

00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,110
traveling you've got to be okay not

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,610
living in your house or your apartment

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,990
or getting rid of it completely you've

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,220
got to be comfortable being in a country

00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,320
where you don't speak the language or

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,850
know what food is gonna be there those

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,309
things I mean I love traveling but those

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,870
things cause so much anxiety for me

00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:53,149
we'll put that as an interest on the

00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,740
side like I mean getting out and trying

00:30:53,149 --> 00:31:00,019
things but I like being at home too I

00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,889
think a little bit more so the next

00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:02,629
thing I want to talk about is some of

00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:05,740
the things I did to try and figure this

00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:08,749
out and achieve this balance between

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:15,230
interest and passion so this is the load

00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:19,789
balancing portion so the three things

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:22,249
that that right oh this is the part I

00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:23,840
skipped so yeah I realize and to make

00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:26,360
the good the make the right decisions

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,279
between figuring all these out I needed

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,269
to have a good base to start from you

00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,950
know it's when your start making

00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:32,629
decisions off the cuff

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,309
you don't always end up where you should

00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:37,789
be so that meant I needed to start

00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:39,080
finding some balance and it's good

00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,309
before you start making important

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,220
decisions or changes in your life that

00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:47,720
you start from the right place and so

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,100
this is where I sort of I put all that

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,259
together and find that balance in that

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:55,549
platform so the foundation in most

00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:59,269
spiritual cultures is mind body and

00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:00,769
spirit and you know how good things

00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:04,999
always come in threes I like that it's

00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:07,879
gonna be a running theme here as an

00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:09,470
introvert you could also sort of think

00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:10,700
of them this way the mind is sort of

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,200
your professional side that's your

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,970
analytical well for most of us

00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,220
developers that would be the analytical

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,659
side it's gonna be different for

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,730
everybody but you can still figure out

00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:21,740
which pieces fit or what each piece

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,039
represents for you so the mind the

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,860
professional side the learning side body

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,690
is kind of the personal side that for me

00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,899
personally that is hanging out with my

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,249
friends or that's running that's doing

00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:37,549
projects around the house things like

00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:39,320
that I'm going to talk about these a

00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:40,730
little more detail but the spirit then

00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,129
for if you're thinking on it on an

00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,690
introverts term that's the private side

00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:47,629
that's my me time when I'm away from

00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,740
everybody else so I'm talking about the

00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:50,690
mind for little bit so this is like I

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,159
said the time I spend on work this is my

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,049
analytical brain this is my computer

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,809
time my thinking my processing my

00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:58,399
creative problem-solving and it's gonna

00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:00,100
be different for everybody depending on

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,910
where you fall into

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,170
if you want to go with those

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,320
myers-briggs I'm not crazy about that

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:07,390
one in particular but you know your mind

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,000
so that's your your professional side

00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,610
your thinking side for me the body the

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,870
personal that's exercising spending time

00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:16,540
with my wife my friends working on

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,820
projects that's kind of the opposite of

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,400
when I'm working that's the balance to

00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:23,050
that so you can think of it that way but

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,730
then the this is the meantime the

00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,770
running the meditating reading the

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,420
things I want to read writing the things

00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,980
I want to write now extroverts you get

00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,260
your energy from being around other

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,610
people so shift these around to fit for

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,420
you but the important thing is to find

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:39,760
this balance between the three and when

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,350
you do this this is Zone in the middle

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,400
which I didn't want to try and jam words

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,200
in there cuz I didn't think I have space

00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,820
on the slide that's where your

00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,990
self-awareness comes from I call that

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,090
the happy place you get everything

00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:51,790
balanced in that spot in the middle

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,840
starts to overlap or everything overlaps

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,070
to form that spot in the middle and it

00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,880
lines up and that's where I feel

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,380
confident and calm and in like where I

00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,540
understand where my life is I feel in

00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,950
control that way and you can see in

00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,740
between where they overlap if things

00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,290
start to skew at a proportion it's gonna

00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,570
start affecting you if you spend all

00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,040
your time working which I've done before

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,990
where you give up all your free time

00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,190
your personal time to just work on the

00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,330
project to get it done

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,770
you're gonna start falling out of

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,940
balance your emotional states gonna

00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:22,210
start to decline you're gonna run out of

00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,580
energy or your subconscious is gonna

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,780
start going out of control you start to

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,000
lose your happy place and you start

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:35,350
making decisions from a an unbalanced

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,540
platform so it's kind of a really great

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:39,090
word there I don't like thinking in

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:43,150
these

00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,020
exact terms all the time but when you

00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,250
start to put things into these

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,880
categories it really started to make

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,880
sense for me

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,730
so

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,960
I started thinking like how or there was

00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,700
a point of few years ago I started

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,500
wondering how people were accomplishing

00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,420
so much more than I was you know I'm

00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,740
figuring these things out only they

00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,210
don't have more time than I do we all

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,950
have the same amount of time so I

00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,750
figured they must just be better tuned

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,010
to the night was so this was the next

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,859
step I started doing is I got to figure

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:13,650
out how to where's my time going and

00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:17,730
where can I apply it better so how can i

00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:19,230
tune myself up here we go first one

00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,900
ready for this big surprise diet and

00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:25,560
exercise it turns out you do a little

00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:30,960
bit of this goes a long way I've been

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:32,849
working on these for a while I started

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,619
paying more attention to what I ate how

00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:36,750
much I ate and when I ate and these

00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,859
here's a I'm not gonna rag on any of

00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,960
these for too long here but here's a

00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,920
couple quick steps that I made a world

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,040
of difference for me

00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,079
so first the sugary drinks in the

00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,760
fast-food gotta go you cut that crap out

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,349
of your diet it's like having a second

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,950
person like you just have so much more

00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:55,260
energy eating a few plants instead of

00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:58,740
meats and cheeses all the time I've done

00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,040
that and it's I have I just feel more a

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,839
less lethargic more active a little bit

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,640
smaller portions you can eat more of

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,680
them just make them smaller each time

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,869
don't you know don't eat till you're

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,819
full eat till you're satisfied kind of

00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,220
thing you avoid that food coma feeling

00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:16,560
and finally don't eat right before bed

00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,210
this one was really crazy so I started

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,130
making alarm on my watch

00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,960
to eat at like three hours before I

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,520
would go to bed and I would by the time

00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,440
it was time to go to bed I'm maybe

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,780
sometimes felt a little bit hungry but

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,829
usually I was just excited for breakfast

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,160
in the morning so I was like ready to

00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:33,660
wake up and go and then you wake up in

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,040
the morning a lot easier that way it's

00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:39,210
those go back one oh it's gonna make me

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,960
answer all these

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,960
oh man

00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,760
yes I mean so these are just really

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,900
basic steps I could go on a lot more

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,090
about these and there's lots of

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,590
information out there about them but yet

00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,880
doing these things it made me happier I

00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,800
felt more productive I felt like I had

00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,990
more energy and I could focus better on

00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,250
on the things I wanted to do and then

00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,720
the exercise stuff this doesn't have to

00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,750
be super strenuous either this is very

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,950
simple things you know stand up and take

00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,880
a break every once in a while from your

00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:08,230
computer at the Pomodoro effect is I

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,130
don't think I wrote this one down in

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,260
here every set a timer for every 25

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,450
minutes and when that timer goes off

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,800
stand up for five just look away from

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,140
your computer screen do a few push-ups

00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,420
go take your cereal bowl back down to

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,340
the kitchen walk around your office just

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,870
take five minutes every twenty five you

00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,510
don't have to stop your billable hour

00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,070
timer because when you come back to your

00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,630
screen it's like you kind of starting

00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,580
over but your energy level your focus

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,960
goes up again so you're getting more out

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,240
of the work and your day will go by

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,680
faster you will feel better and you

00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,110
won't be as you know stressed and tired

00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,270
at the end of the day if you can walk

00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,040
for thirty minutes and if you can get

00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,690
outside that's even better but just

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,370
spending a little like 30 minutes a day

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,400
to get your heart rate up does wonders

00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:53,290
for your focus and for your mind if you

00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,270
can get outside that's awesome there's

00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,910
lots of studies that show vitamin D

00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:01,270
fresh air is has a calming effect and

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:03,610
will approve your mood and if you came

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,840
later out there put work on hold and try

00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,640
and start all of them we'll try and

00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,830
start all these things early but put

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,450
work on hold put it if you can let your

00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,790
thoughts just sit on the Shelf and just

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,080
be where you are but that's if you can't

00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,280
you have too much going on in your head

00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,900
that's a great time to just let your

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,520
mind wander and get that crap cleared

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,460
out you come back refreshed and focused

00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,510
and ready to go and then starting early

00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,850
if you can do this early in the morning

00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,890
getting your heart rate up before before

00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,270
you start work or at lunch right before

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,150
you start your second half of the day

00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,790
avoids those doldrums completely this

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,630
was such a major change to getting

00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,100
through the day and being more

00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,460
productive and focused instead of

00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,440
feeling burnt out and overloaded

00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,490
thinking you could go on for all more

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,840
and more with the studies for this but

00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,350
that those basic things were really

00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,350
important

00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,640
so the next behavior shift that I

00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:54,100
decided to go through was defragging my

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:58,600
life it's not even still a thing I don't

00:38:54,100 --> 00:39:03,010
have a Windows computer but this was

00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:05,110
basically decluttering and the reason I

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,030
realized that I needed to do this was

00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,350
because I was getting angry a lot of the

00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,540
time because I was running into crap in

00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:12,640
my house like literally hitting it with

00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,140
my knee or knocking it off a shelf not

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,760
having any place to put stuff down when

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,640
I got home and I'm like there's no space

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:24,580
in the house it turns out I had too much

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:27,390
 in my house so when I get tossed

00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,200
back and forth between things like

00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,390
projects at work or this is somebody

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,270
else has control of my time I that

00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,100
drives me nuts and clutter can do the

00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,300
same sort of thing to you I mean some

00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,620
situations are always gonna be out of

00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,540
our control like we can't control the

00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,670
weather now but there are a lot of

00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:45,430
things we can control and we can remove

00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:48,990
a lot of these distractions we have a

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:52,510
better grip on our time a better focus

00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:55,870
so the idea is to remove the clutter

00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,310
remove the things we don't need and keep

00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,470
the things that provide a value to us

00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,850
and it's easy to say that in one

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,040
sentence it's a much more difficult

00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,750
thing to practice that right off the bat

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,700
so and there are lots of resources out

00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,440
there for how to do it but if you can it

00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,540
makes a big difference so the first step

00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,830
is identifying what the clutter is and

00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,920
there are three forms this comes in

00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,970
again the threes so when we heard

00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,710
decluttering we tend to think like

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,120
cleaning off the desk dumping out the

00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,800
drunk drawer or like weeding out the

00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,030
closet now those are important steps but

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,740
there's actually three areas you want to

00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,020
look at the first is the physical

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:29,020
clutter those things

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:33,280
the second area oh these things the

00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:35,110
digital clutter finally there's also

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,550
mental clutter you need to consider and

00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,850
that's kind of keeping your mind

00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,290
straight so again we're just scratching

00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,820
the surface on some of these and there's

00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,440
lots more and I'm happy to talk about it

00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,150
at any time just be prepared I like to

00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,460
talk about it if you ask me about it I

00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,120
am happy to talk about it

00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,290
but the physical clutter a lot of the

00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,670
stuff I had laying around my house

00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,710
turned out it was like just in case

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:58,380
items or it was just stuff that hadn't

00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,610
been thrown away junk mail or books that

00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,460
we weren't reading anymore then why the

00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,080
hell did I keep all my college textbooks

00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,610
there's there's like thousands of

00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,320
dollars if you go with a book price when

00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,510
I bought them sitting on my shelf worth

00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,370
seven dollars and 42 cents when I looked

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,900
them up on trying to return them so I'm

00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:16,050
just in the donation bin I started

00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,910
clearing everything out so if you find

00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,350
those just in case items or you start to

00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,790
look through and find the pieces that

00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,440
you don't actually that aren't doing

00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:25,740
something in your life try getting rid

00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,050
of them you can open up space in your on

00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,030
your work space in your office getting

00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:34,440
those things out of your visual realm if

00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:35,460
you can they would be less distracting

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,110
for you there's studies that have found

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,820
that like physical clutter actually will

00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,140
compete for your attention when your

00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,730
eyes are being drawn to these different

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,900
things all over the place so if you're

00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,910
the kind of person he needs to sit and

00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,770
focus try pushing some of that stuff out

00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,980
of the way clean off your desk and try

00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,750
and keep it that way if you can I mean

00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,000
this goes for everything from clothes

00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,930
books those are the easy ones trinkets

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,060
those get to be a little more difficult

00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,990
but then the nostalgic items I'm not

00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,400
going to get into that those are the

00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,080
hardest to do but you can go all the way

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,860
through there and once you start that

00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,420
process

00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:07,650
it's amazing how getting rid of those

00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,470
distractions will let you be more

00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,640
focused and how sort of freer you feel

00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,150
when you don't have all of that junk

00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,800
sitting around like staring back at you

00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,050
the digital clutter is another thing so

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,840
we have all these screens now that light

00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,100
up and flash and make noise and buzz and

00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,020
it seems like every time you turn them

00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,360
off they invent new ways to throw stuff

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,550
back in your face I how many people have

00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,870
at least two devices on them right now

00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:33,530
that will buzz or make noise at them

00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:37,640
when something happens I've got two

00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:37,640
three got an iPad hung up

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,060
yeah that's fun when you're on a calling

00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,300
you got to put do not disturb mode on

00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,140
four devices that's nuts yeah but

00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,180
there's a whole industry that's growing

00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,830
up around this now where people's jobs

00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,840
are to figure out how to make you look

00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,660
at their app how to make you look at

00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,130
their stuff because the more time you

00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,820
spend it the more of your time there's

00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,310
that word again

00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,110
that you spend on their things that

00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:07,240
increases their revenue that increases

00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:08,800
their name their brand name so while

00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,840
they're there trying to monetize our

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,550
attention if you can try doing things

00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,560
like leave your phone behind if you go

00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,630
for a walk or you know when you go out

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,620
to eat put it on silent leave it in your

00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,000
pocket or you play the game where

00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,310
everyone puts their phone on the table

00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,110
upside down on top of them you know top

00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,690
of one another first person to reach for

00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:28,870
their phone pays the bill try that one

00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:33,550
at lunch after this mm-hmm especially if

00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:35,860
you go out of a big group so yeah if you

00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,810
can leave your phone behind here's

00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,880
there's this is another big adjustment

00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,770
don't try all these at once you can blow

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,260
your mind don't charge your devices

00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:45,640
where you sleep like if I if I can I

00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,220
will leave my phone in the office to

00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,660
charge I don't care I do read on my iPad

00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,890
at night so that once it's on my

00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,470
nightstand I try and leave all that

00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:55,840
stuff in the office or all intentionally

00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,370
where like I work from home so I'll wear

00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,680
shorts that don't have pockets in them

00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:02,320
so I can't like take my phone with me as

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,430
easily turns out I'm not really missing

00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,750
that much this is the next piece of this

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:11,010
don't figure out what's actually

00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:13,540
important to be notified about there are

00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,130
I had an app on my phone once following

00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,720
sports scores and it was during football

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,860
season just constantly like oh the

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,290
Chargers are winning the Broncos are

00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,490
losing and everything is going on I

00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,320
called it the relationship killer app

00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:25,230
I'm no longer dating the girl I was

00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,610
dating when I had that out

00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,440
it was really annoying it that's just an

00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,540
extreme example of do you really need to

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,730
know the score of the sports game right

00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,080
now think about that that this is a

00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:37,270
design to get your attention

00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,320
right now it's distracting you from the

00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,120
things you want to be doing that you

00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,340
should be doing and your focus is going

00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,230
all over the place so turn off any

00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,790
notifications that are not important the

00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,280
only ones I keep on my phone now are

00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,990
when somebody's trying to contact me

00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,420
directly if I get a phone call a text

00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:53,370
message

00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,530
like a Twitter direct mention or

00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,120
whatever method of communication I use

00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,910
on those apps if someone's trying to get

00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,840
ahold of me and I need to respond to it

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:04,020
that's that's what I have on there

00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,970
everything else I let go even I don't

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,870
even have I don't want any email

00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:12,270
notifications on my phone anymore and

00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:15,300
it's much as you try though that's not

00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:18,780
always enough because these and things I

00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,270
hate these these these are designed to

00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,570
like draw your attention in these stupid

00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:27,110
things are like the creepy dudes with

00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:29,790
vans and candy of the tech world because

00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:31,200
they're calling you like hey look I've

00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,620
got some oh look somebody else hey you

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,840
should come oh my gosh and like every

00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,130
piece of me is saying don't open the app

00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,330
don't open the app but I didn't evitable

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,970
eaves like there's there's an I have to

00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:43,140
see what's going on in there it's anyone

00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,000
else's anxiety going through the roof

00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:49,170
just watching that because I hated

00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,780
making it's like so yeah if you can turn

00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:54,360
off the red dots to oh man when you have

00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:57,080
like a complete clear display on your

00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,700
phone with no dots oh it's amazing

00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,230
but this goes for your computer to turn

00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,730
off notifications on your computer shut

00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,890
down your email client while you're not

00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,330
looking at email email I mean everyone's

00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,740
job is a little different I understand

00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,480
that but for developers at least and I'm

00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,940
from the designers I've talked to email

00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,230
is generally like the clients know if

00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,720
they need to get a hold of you you go to

00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,130
slack email is secondary level

00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,320
communication that's passive

00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,490
communication so I will wait for a

00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,200
little while like check my email at

00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,330
lunch maybe or sometimes I forget all

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,560
day and guess what I haven't missed

00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:30,120
anything yet so I definitely recommend

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,010
that but any distracting apps that you

00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,690
keep open I tend to if I had Twitter

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,620
open I would always like tab back over

00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:39,270
that so cut that out

00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:41,400
and you can even install apps and

00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:43,590
services it'll block distracting things

00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,270
from you or I stop your time when you're

00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,910
getting out of those distracting

00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,140
websites but your brains - they're

00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,980
amazing things but they have their

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,120
limits so we can be bombarded with great

00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,500
ideas and all these things all the time

00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,930
so even while you're here at Drupal con

00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,100
especially use it to do list if you get

00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,390
a great idea just write something down

00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,290
and then you can come back to it later

00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:05,640
it doesn't have to be

00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:07,380
right now writing down those ideas don't

00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,850
act like not acting immediately on them

00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,170
gives you time to prioritize them and

00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,580
later and figure out which ones are most

00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,050
important while maintaining your focus

00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,150
on what you're in right now it's

00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:17,040
journaling especially is good for that I

00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,720
found if you can if you can journal just

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,950
even a sentence or two right before you

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,000
go to bed like here's what I did today

00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,760
here's the next thing I want to do

00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,260
tomorrow you will sleep so much better

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,610
because your brain is not processing

00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,100
those thoughts anymore it's written down

00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,420
for you to come back to later and

00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:32,580
walking even it's a little time walking

00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,810
and clear that out and I'm gonna try and

00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,190
go a little quickly so we have time for

00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:39,750
Q&A through the rest of some of these so

00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:42,630
I apologize if I'm talking too fast so

00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:44,040
do all these if you're interested in

00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:46,050
doing any of these things don't try and

00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,390
do them all at once do pieces at a time

00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:50,130
I've been working on this for years and

00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:52,680
trying to improve some things about

00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:55,050
myself so the eating better the

00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,060
exercising start a little bit by a

00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,320
little bit if you drink sodas all the

00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,520
time and you want to try and improve

00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,070
your health by cutting back on those cut

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,660
back like one soda a day or one there

00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,550
one a week and then the next week do to

00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,410
the next week three and work yourself up

00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,520
to it so you're not shocking yourself in

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,900
to some of these changes because this is

00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,610
a lot of drastic stuff if you try and do

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,230
it all at once but you'll start to

00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:17,430
realize those benefits if you start to

00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:19,730
do those things so the retooling kind of

00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:22,200
building on this new foundation now so

00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,520
here are some of the tools I discovered

00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,250
along the way that helped me get to the

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,980
to work through some of those those

00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,960
balancing acts and the decluttering and

00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:35,040
such so learning to say no or at least

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,060
say not yet I would say yes to

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,430
everything because I thought it was

00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,540
important I wanted to do it and the most

00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,730
successful people in the world get

00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,460
approached all the time for interviews

00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,840
and new business ventures and meetings

00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,760
and this and that and you know you know

00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,550
what they say when they get all those

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,210
things they say no which is a slide I

00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,210
don't have in there

00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,220
you say no now so you can say hell yes

00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,180
to the important things that come up

00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,770
later

00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,630
you don't overwhelm yourself with

00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,620
everything it's perfectly acceptable if

00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,120
somebody asks you like can you help me

00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,740
with this you be honest with them like

00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,630
I've got a lot of stuff going on now let

00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,860
me write it down to figure out if I got

00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,330
time to do this and I'll get back to you

00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,880
perfectly acceptable answer then say

00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:17,270
yeah yeah let's go do that that got me

00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,200
into trouble a lot of times so here if

00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,730
you've got a lot of stuff on your plate

00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,770
now we're gonna get into some of the

00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,090
like if you want to take photos you can

00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,530
but the slides will be available later

00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:27,020
but here's some more of the fun

00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:29,930
graphical things the eisenhower matrix

00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:32,060
everyone heard of this woman before this

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,730
is where you make a grid 4x4 a 2x2 grid

00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,200
and you label the top or that you label

00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,810
the columns important not important and

00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,690
the rows urgent not urgent and then you

00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,010
fill up each quadrant with the things on

00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,570
your list so if you've got a ton of

00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,530
things a ton of responsibilities and you

00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,150
feel like you're being pulled in a

00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,100
hundred different directions try this

00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,470
just write them all down and then fill

00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:54,020
them in here the most important urgent

00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:55,130
things and define importance by what it

00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,930
is you're trying to achieve so it's

00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:58,580
gonna be different for everybody do

00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,140
those right away the things that are you

00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,240
have to do now the urgent things but

00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,770
they're not important put those on your

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,870
schedule figure out a time when you hat

00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:08,630
when you can do those so something with

00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:12,530
a deadline will say would fall under the

00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:14,050
urgent not urgent and important see if

00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:16,220
you can delegate those to somebody else

00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,600
asking someone for help or if you have

00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,800
co-workers you could take on something

00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,030
or let your boss know I've got too much

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,430
going on you need to get rid of some of

00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,600
those tasks it's important but it

00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,340
doesn't need to get done right now and I

00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,510
have too many other things to do if you

00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:29,090
find things on your list that are not

00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:31,670
important and not urgent at least for

00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:33,560
the universe that you're working in and

00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,420
they're in the regards to these

00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,490
particular tasks so like for me

00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,290
preparing for DrupalCon

00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:41,150
playing the guitar well aside from the

00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:42,560
pre knows stuff that fell into the not

00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,180
important not urgent like I could

00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,160
practice and play around on my own

00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,360
except for the stuff I needed to do just

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,310
for the pre note so that for that

00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,670
particular case fell into the eliminate

00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:54,349
category

00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:56,000
this is this kind of ties back into the

00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:57,380
first few things I was talking about if

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,180
you're struggling with whether or not

00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,490
you should go for an idea or you're

00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,130
trying to figure out where to start

00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:08,329
Simonson X golden circle I really like

00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:09,619
this most people end up starting from

00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:11,540
the wrong direction so remember how I

00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:12,859
said I wanted to be an expert because I

00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,150
wanted to be a rock star I wanted the

00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:18,170
notoriety and the fame and I wanted to

00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:23,230
feel important that's the product of the

00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:25,849
process the process is I want to be a

00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,799
contributor to Drupal but why do I want

00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:29,240
to be a contributor to Drupal so it's

00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:31,579
more like why do I want to be a rock

00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,780
star the rock star here is the what so

00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:34,910
you start from the inner side the why

00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,500
why do I want to do this I want to give

00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:39,020
back to the community I want to share

00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:42,020
the knowledge that I have and if you

00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,220
really have a solid why then you figure

00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,599
out how you're going to do that and

00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,420
finally what the product is going to be

00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:51,109
and be careful not to confuse your Y and

00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:53,299
your what so for example making money

00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:56,329
being a rock star those are things that

00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:59,859
are the products of finding your why or

00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:59,859
how moving that through

00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,330
and so this is a Japanese world a word

00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,450
Vikki guy

00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:10,470
it means reason for being and this one's

00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,460
a little hard to see but don't worry I

00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:12,660
have a different one I'm gonna show up

00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,160
there I wanted to put this there because

00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,830
it's a little bit clear in some of the

00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,820
words and it's more common in this

00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:23,520
format at least but I have another one

00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:25,230
that I like a little bit better there's

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,020
a little more to it but it's essentially

00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:29,850
this it is the same thing but if you

00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,740
take a look at those big pieces on the

00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,630
top the what are you good at what turns

00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,550
you money what you love what the world

00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:38,220
needs and I know this sounds a little

00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:40,140
bit cliche but when I started looking at

00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:44,040
this and figuring out where I was

00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:45,390
landing on this on this chart you figure

00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,700
out sort of where I am in that journey

00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:49,950
like okay this I now I understand the

00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,840
pieces that I'm missing or where I want

00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:52,980
to take this in the next step sometimes

00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,480
like I'm working as a developer but

00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,830
where do I go next what do I really want

00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,020
to do and I really that was at the core

00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:00,150
of why I wasn't figuring out what I

00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,770
wanted to do so if you can find

00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,900
something that fits all of these you're

00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:06,120
good at it it earns you money you love

00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,770
doing it and the world needs it you

00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:11,430
found that sweet spot right in the

00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:13,770
middle your purpose but they each place

00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:15,330
that they overlap has its own label so

00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,250
if you love it and it earns you money

00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:19,020
then that's a good job if you're also

00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:22,020
good at it that's an opportunity for

00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,340
service and so on and you can find no

00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,140
charge obviously in the side but you can

00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,850
find these things on on the web as well

00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:30,360
but I just I really liked the way that

00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:35,010
that sort of outlined that lines of all

00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:36,300
those items so stack overflow I talked

00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:39,000
about a lot of stuff a lot of tools

00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:43,590
methods different organizing techniques

00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,240
for and being productive I also I mean I

00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,910
read a lot of books blog post articles

00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,780
so I've found a lot of stuff that way

00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,880
there are so many things you can do

00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,990
meditation exercise I can't cover all

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,810
that stuff here and I've already covered

00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,680
a lot but I do often tweet and blog

00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,920
about these things

00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,150
and I do love talking about it too so if

00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,040
you want to catch me at some point while

00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,080
you're here I'm happy to talk about

00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,280
these in further detail or give you some

00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,620
tips on some of the stuff that I've gone

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,370
through and this is by no means a road

00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:13,550
map the map shows you a starting place

00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:15,750
in an ending play

00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:17,130
so you would draw a line from your

00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,960
origin to your destination but if you

00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,520
don't know what exactly your destination

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,760
is you can't draw that line you can't

00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,200
connect dots that don't exist yet so

00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,660
instead think of this as a compass it's

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,490
a navigational beacon it's it gives you

00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,690
direction but you always need to be

00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,740
recalibrating it when you get to the

00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,730
next step pull out your compass again

00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,410
make sure you're going the right

00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,990
direction because the end might not be

00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:38,730
where you predict it to be 10 years ago

00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,320
10 years ago I couldn't tell you that I

00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:43,170
would be standing on a stage and

00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,030
Nashville playing the guitar but I ended

00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:48,330
up here by calibrating my compass as I

00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:50,040
went so all these behavior changes these

00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:53,220
things they will always have some level

00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:56,339
of push back for you we're by nature we

00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,630
tend to be at first to change so when we

00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:59,550
start to change these things our body

00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,810
our subconscious says no no no hey we're

00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,099
comfortable over there what are we doing

00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,750
over here in the uncomfortable zone you

00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:07,280
got to get out of your comfort zone

00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:10,140
before you can grow and improve yourself

00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,480
so through all this I learned a few

00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,640
things about where I am the community

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,180
turns out still people I just understand

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,440
them better now I've met some extremely

00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,390
interesting some dedicated some

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,710
passionate people this is why I started

00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:26,880
that podcast I like telling those

00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:28,080
stories and I love to teach so and I

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,500
still love to code I found a new passion

00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,150
in the code as well but that's it's only

00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,270
one thing and it's not my primary thing

00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:37,290
so don't feel obligated to give back you

00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,970
can't find your place in the community

00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:42,990
but you feel that pressure that's fine

00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:44,670
you don't have to do anything I feel

00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,080
very grateful that I can do it and I

00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:48,450
found these things and these tools have

00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,650
helped me get there and finally feel

00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:52,020
like I'm giving back to the community

00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,970
that gave me so much so aside from that

00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,099
slide that I heard that presentation I

00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,690
mentioned earlier on which had the URL

00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,520
on it just here's a few other

00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:02,250
recommendations for some of the tools

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,070
that I learned from figuring all these

00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,300
things out some of the books on the side

00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,119
there you are a badass by Jensen

00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,990
Sherrill fantastic book I won't read

00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,339
through all these because I want to get

00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:15,000
have a few minutes here for questions

00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:16,800
but that's the presentation so thank you

00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,470
and are there any questions if there are

00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,770
please come on up to the microphone

00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:27,520
