Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Regardless of role, writing compelling content is an almost inescapable part of modern working life. And whether you’re motivated by a core belief in open-source idea sharing or by a desire to build your personal brand, the ability to turn your ideas into consumable (and shareable!) content is increasingly important.

That being said, not everyone feels comfortable putting their ideas into words. Enter: The Article Idea Generation Writing Template (AIGWT). This terribly named but very useful framework can help take you from an idea to a full outline, and set you up to write content with (relative) ease.

This presentation will give you applicable techniques for turning an idea into a full-fledged article. But we won’t just talk the talk, we’ll walk the walk with a brief, non-terrifying writing exercise to help get your first piece off the ground!

In this presentation, we'll:

Go over the basics of what makes a good piece of writing and how to structure an article
Discuss tips and exercises that can help you get writing
Introduce The AIGWT and how it can help structure your writing
Do a quick exercise using The AIGWT so you can leave the session with the beginnings of your first article!
