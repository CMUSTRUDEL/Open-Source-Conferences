Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: The AIGWT: Stupid Name, Smart Writing Guide
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Regardless of role, writing compelling content is an almost inescapable part of modern working life. And whether you’re motivated by a core belief in open-source idea sharing or by a desire to build your personal brand, the ability to turn your ideas into consumable (and shareable!) content is increasingly important.

That being said, not everyone feels comfortable putting their ideas into words. Enter: The Article Idea Generation Writing Template (AIGWT). This terribly named but very useful framework can help take you from an idea to a full outline, and set you up to write content with (relative) ease.

This presentation will give you applicable techniques for turning an idea into a full-fledged article. But we won’t just talk the talk, we’ll walk the walk with a brief, non-terrifying writing exercise to help get your first piece off the ground!

In this presentation, we'll:

Go over the basics of what makes a good piece of writing and how to structure an article
Discuss tips and exercises that can help you get writing
Introduce The AIGWT and how it can help structure your writing
Do a quick exercise using The AIGWT so you can leave the session with the beginnings of your first article!

okay that other presentations starting

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,600
so let's start here take my cues from

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,720
the sound and other rooms just gonna

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,619
quickly go through these template slides

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,540
exciting stuff I rare today I just

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,770
before we get too deep into this want to

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,950
make sure that the people in this room

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,080
intend to be in this room I'm gonna be

00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,270
presenting on the egg wit which is a

00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,920
stupidly named but I'll see you look at

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,750
that I knew there was one there's like

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,090
11 - oh sevens in a row someone was

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,829
gonna get it wrong it's a stupid name

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,170
there's a smart framework and it's a

00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,809
guide to help you get set up to be able

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,890
to write effectively which we will get

00:00:53,809 --> 00:01:00,140
into so what will I be talking about

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,730
today first I'll talk about myself which

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,190
is my favorite topic so it's gonna be

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,690
the bulk of the presentation and then

00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,910
I'll talk about the egg wit and what it

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,399
is what in particular those letters

00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,399
stand for and then I'll walk you through

00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:15,320
it section I like to call Fink a section

00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,600
I like to call do and then we'll have

00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,280
some final tips many many final tips

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,930
frankly there's a lot more tips probably

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,100
than the actual egg wood itself but

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,950
that's neither here nor there

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,240
and then hopefully a time pending we'll

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,409
have the chance to do a little bit of

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,299
writing so if you have some form of

00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,310
computer or pencil and paper or some

00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,470
kind of implement a phone you can just

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,630
jot notes down on whatever works for you

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,700
if not you can also just do all the

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,610
writing up in your old noggins you've

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,170
got the power I'm excited for you if not

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,520
we'll just skip that and you can take

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,530
that framework home with you and do it

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,759
by yourself on your own time and then I

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,259
would like to leave a little bit of time

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,500
for questions if there are any so we'll

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,210
skip the writing if the questions are

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,850
the only thing available oh we've got

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,840
someone coming in I'm all good but if

00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,400
you'd like to leave that for the next

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,460
presenter its water being delivered

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,200
it's exciting thank you though someone

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,189
would like my speaker water it's at the

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,170
back of the room so let's start about me

00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:12,709
Who am I why should you listen to any of

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,370
the stuff I'm about to tell you I am Lee

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,170
Bryant

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,519
I'm the content manager at my planet

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,650
we're a software a studio we were based

00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,910
out of Toronto we've got offices kind of

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,530
all over the world actually one of my

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,320
colleagues is sitting around front hi

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,650
Everett and I am the co-author of the

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,530
egg wit the

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,030
is co-authored by the chief design

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,440
officer of my planet a man named Erik

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,140
von stackelberg who himself is actually

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,940
giving a presentation as we speak at a

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,650
conference up in Toronto fitc so

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,090
strongly encourage you to check out that

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,590
conference when it goes online because

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,829
he's gonna have a great presentation

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,420
about designing for smart things content

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,829
manager what does that mean it means I

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,769
spend my entire days

00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:51,900
wrangling and writing content the

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,510
writing part I feel I've got a pretty

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,019
good handle on the wrangling part means

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,730
I spent a lot of my time working with a

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:02,819
cross-section of people who have varied

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,099
levels of writing experience and varied

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,109
interest in writing sometimes their

00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:10,290
being stronger and strong armed into it

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:12,090
a little bit so we're talking kind of

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,209
the gamut of folks in design and

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,579
development product management all that

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,200
kind of stuff trying to get content out

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,060
the door for people who've either got

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,859
PhDs that they've written entire theses

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,049
for or have avoided writing their whole

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:28,040
lives and basically only speak in binary

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,970
code so it's kind of a fun mix of folks

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,410
in my background is I have an

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,120
advertising and copywriting degree that

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,130
I got from Humber College in Toronto and

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,630
also a Bachelor of Arts from McGill

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,829
University and International Development

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,750
and religious studies which again is

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:42,569
just a lot a lot a lot a lot of writing

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,109
both of those things as a writer aside

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,400
from those things my experience runs a

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,739
little bit towards the more pop culture

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,269
end of the spectrum probably I wrote for

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,340
the hairpin which is a now-defunct blog

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,349
that was part of the all Network big

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,299
cheers in the back thank you a strong

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,599
agree strong agree all right Peter the

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,280
hairpin I wrote for Yahoo on contract

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,599
for about a year I've written for

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,769
Toronto Life magazine which is kind of a

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,620
local popular glossy mag proper a proper

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,519
magazine few of those that there are

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,079
left-right inversion and clutch all

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,180
kinds of different online publications

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,150
and then also huge topic for me was my

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,380
third grade diary where this I'm going

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,459
to give you a little synopsis of it

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,889
right now actually think it's important

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,810
I was gonna marry Toru Levinson he's

00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,280
just my number one true dream love

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,590
according to my grade 3 diary and as a

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,330
fun side note to that side note I'm

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,099
actually the MC of Toru Levinson's

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,830
wedding this fall he's marrying my best

00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:37,110
friend so still going to be at the altar

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,740
with him just not the one marrying him

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,240
it's gonna be fun I'm a bit of a job

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,620
junkie which I mentioned because I think

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,210
a lot of you have probably heard before

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,580
and if not then I think it's relevant

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,199
mentioning writing is often a really

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,520
powerful thing to speak to from your own

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,400
experience and so the fact that I've had

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:58,050
roughly 36 jobs which averages about two

00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,689
a year for my working life is worthwhile

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,060
information to have I was a synchronized

00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,460
swimming coach for a long time I was a

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,930
mortgage funder I've been a costumers

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,780
assistant I've built 12 foot tall

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,879
puppets and fat suits I was a waitress

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,039
I've been a camp director I worked at a

00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,039
Christmas tree lot I finished support

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,300
worker I have more job histories than

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,039
anyone has any right to have in about

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,110
three lifetimes so if you'd like

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,150
information on any of those topics come

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,800
speak to me afterwards and then this

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,940
fancy template you see was designed by a

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,919
colleague of mine which means there's a

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,479
fourth column I couldn't think of a

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,300
fourth thing to put in it and I'm bad at

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,680
adjusting templates so here is a video

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,680
of my cat making a noise

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,040
that's what he actually sounds like it's

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,130
very distracting when you're trying to

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,590
write I can assure you so enough about

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,750
me let's talk about the egg wit what is

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,700
the egg wit aside from this stupidest

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,490
sounding thing you've ever heard the egg

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,920
wit is the article idea generation

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,140
writing template it's not better in

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,120
long-form we did a very bad job naming

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,520
this my deepest and sincerest apologies

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,810
but what it is is a framework to help

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,790
get you writing it is not and I will say

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,830
this right up front a silver bullet that

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,890
you are going to write an amazing thing

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,870
that's on you all this can do is set you

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,520
up so that you can guarantee for

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,810
yourself that you're getting to that

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,840
point it will hopefully do what we aimed

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,300
for it to do so Eric and I that chief

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,530
design officer at my planet and myself

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,390
like I say we've got a lot of people

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,760
we're trying to get contributing content

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,650
I work with a lot of experts in Drupal

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,990
and other forms of development and in

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,210
design I myself am NOT the expert on

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,400
those things and so I would love to have

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,660
them be writing it instead of me be the

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,100
one writing it but we were running into

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,390
problems getting people across the

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,540
finish line they were constantly having

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,820
these ideas and then nothing would come

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,570
of it and one of the things we realized

00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,490
was that they didn't really have the

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,260
building blocks to get it to the point

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,370
where they could write it part of the

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,380
impediment was just carving out time

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,490
production teams are always super busy I

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,410
know that and I'm very very

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,440
understanding of it but part of it was

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,840
just the lack of knowledge going into it

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,790
of how to structure something so that in

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,170
a limited amount of time you could

00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,150
actually produce something quite quickly

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,890
so that's why we created this framework

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,780
to sort of help people get across the

00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,460
line and what I think is really lovely

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,480
and nice about it is it almost turns

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,130
your writing into a mad lib style

00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,930
endeavor you've you're gonna go in

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,030
you're gonna create all of the different

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,500
things and then you're just going to

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,050
chunk it together kind of like it's a

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,850
mad lib it just fits which is quite nice

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,680
you guys remember Mad Libs right look

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,790
how diverse that team is Mad Libs really

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,790
had it nailed if I may

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,169
so into the eggwin step 1 think do it

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,030
right in the rest is a breeze this part

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,650
it's I mean I'm gonna say this is

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,070
essential and you can't skip it probably

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,690
like four of the five steps that this is

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:03,500
definitely essential I would say this is

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,330
very very important so option one the

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,350
way we've structured it and it's

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,310
important to note that there are

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,750
obviously going to be a million

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,340
different options for how to generate

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,650
ideas for yourself but we split it into

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,350
two and we split it into two because we

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,479
very much wanted to come at it from a

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,979
place of benefitting for obviously my

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,810
planet and for our colleagues to be able

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,250
to write the stuff that's going to

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,479
relate to their work into our work and

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,700
be able to contribute in that way if

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,250
you're writing personal this may not be

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,870
quite the two starting point options but

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,100
it should still kind of foundationally

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,460
work which you'll understand so option

00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,300
one we created is what grinds your gears

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,930
what's something that's really bugged

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,760
you or annoyed you or has created a

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,070
friction or a problem in your work

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,070
recently that you can use is kind of the

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,620
jumping-off point one of the best ways

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,360
to approach it is to just think about

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,279
that thing that's really irritated you

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,860
and then push it a little further and

00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,540
this is part of why I say a lot of

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,700
people didn't have the tools the

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,170
building blocks to kind of get it past

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,720
this point you'd think of the idea that

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,800
bothered you and then nothing but the

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,089
thing that bothers you needs to be

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,709
delved into a little bit more you need

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,589
to ask things like do you believe this

00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:11,510
happens elsewhere and if so where and

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,010
why you need to start kind of generating

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,230
a lot of these follow-up questions for

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,180
yourself almost treating your own self

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,589
your own brain your own ideas like a

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,140
journalist who's pursuing a story

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,150
doggedly what do you think the core

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,040
issue is when this happens yes this

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,300
thing is annoying but why is this thing

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,060
happening in the first place of what is

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,640
causing this friction in your experience

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,370
and do you have any ideas for solutions

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,770
or applications to apply to this issue

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,170
so how can you solve this problem it's

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,029
great and so fun and I love to do it to

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,380
complain it's actually that productive

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,420
and not many people want to read other

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,459
people just griping on the internet

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,520
about things so come up with ways to

00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:52,190
treat this issue or maybe I don't know

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,260
other concepts for getting people

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,329
involved on how to issue solve the issue

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,390
rather so there's a few things to kind

00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,800
of get a little bit deeper than

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,320
I think people tend to do when they come

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,710
up with their initial idea option two is

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,590
essentially the opposite of that what

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:11,170
inspires you what are some things that

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,880
have really kind of wowed you recently

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,140
or caught your attention or made you

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,060
think oh my gosh this is the greatest

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,770
innovation that I've ever seen in my

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,420
whole life I can't wait to dig deeper

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,560
into this topic there are you could be

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,940
from your everyday life you could be an

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,410
event you attended it to be an idea you

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,730
heard someone say an experience you had

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,460
in a meeting any number of things but

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,160
again that initial moment that initial

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,730
idea of this was so fascinating and I

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,650
loved it

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,120
it's not probably enough to get it

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,580
across the line so start to dig a little

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,020
deeper and challenge yourself to find

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,940
out more about that topic just

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,690
internally in your own mind as to why

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,790
it's appealing what's happening here oh

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,430
there we go sorry I'm unfamiliar with

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,160
advancing keynote slides apparently what

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,570
makes it a fascinating topic what are

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,360
the core concepts at the heart of the

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,640
idea what are the applications of this

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,960
concept to your work again like I say

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,870
this is something that we developed for

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,580
us and our colleagues to be able to

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,160
pointedly do more directed writing for

00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,960
my planet and for themselves and I'm

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,460
assuming most people here are gonna be

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,710
operating from it I have a lot of ideas

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,180
about how to contribute this component

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,070
to Drupal or why this thing needs to be

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,140
expanded in this way so I am gonna give

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,300
it a little bit more of that work effort

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,830
vent but most of this stuff I'm hoping

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,860
you can also extrapolate into other

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,560
writing should you choose to do so

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,600
so that's your think set the final note

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,740
about think option 1 option 2 doesn't

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,960
matter the only thing you need to note

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,100
is that this is not an optional part of

00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,650
the process it's do not skip do not skip

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,560
this step the thinking stage sets the

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,820
stage for the whole thing it's easy to

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
dismiss it because you're like I've got

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,780
this great idea I'll just look up some

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,230
articles and reference them it'll be

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,760
great and off I go to the races but when

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,500
you ask yourself those questions and you

00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,900
drive more at the core of what you're

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,510
trying to communicate you're going to

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,010
give yourself a head start on the actual

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,680
writing because a big part of what's

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,090
going to make your article your piece of

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,560
writing interesting and compelling to

00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,990
someone

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,940
is if it's interesting and compelling to

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,100
you in the first place and that little

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,930
nugget idea isn't typically that

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,700
interesting beyond the first moment you

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,490
really kind of do need to dig into it a

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,800
bit more to keep that going to keep that

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,270
through line of interest so give

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,430
yourself the advantage of just taking a

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,570
little bit of time it's kind of the

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,920
easiest part of the whole process

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,810
because you just have to sit there and

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,180
close your eyes and think why though why

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:36,420
do I like it so you don't even have to

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,590
do anything yet you're just thinking now

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,530
you have to do stuff though step two

00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,220
through five is do time to get to it in

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,390
stages

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,400
baby steps always walking through great

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,470
news because of all that good good

00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,390
thinking you didn't step one you should

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,240
have a fairly easy time coming up with

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:58,140
your central idea you've probably heard

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,250
this before topic sentence thesis lots

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,320
of different names out there for what

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,700
I'm asking you to create here the reason

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,050
you've heard of it before is because

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,760
probably since about Grade three

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,040
teachers have hammered into you the

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,010
importance of having some kind of core

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,410
concept that you are presenting it's

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,070
essential again I said I would say that

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,240
a lot but this one also definitely is

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,610
whatever you call it figuring out that

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,010
core idea is is going to be the driving

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,320
force behind your piece no one wants to

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,839
read just an endless meandering who

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,910
knows what about any old thing if you

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,240
can't say up front what I'm driving at

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,810
is X you've kind of already missed the

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,250
boat so to speak there's a few things

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,690
that people get kind of choked up about

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,670
when you say you have to have this core

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,140
concept and the first is that I don't

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,810
know enough about this topic how can I

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,180
possibly define it yet how could I say

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,310
what my core concept is going to be just

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,810
pick something you can always come back

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,370
and revisit it if you go into your

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,600
research portion and you've found out a

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,950
bunch of stuff and you've looked at a

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,020
bunch of different information and oh

00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,490
that thing you thought was great it

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,160
turns out has a lot of these inherent

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,740
problems you can revisit your thesis

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,020
your central idea and tweak it a little

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,550
to point that out or you can keep it the

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,650
same and just include a secondary

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,420
paragraph I still think this is great in

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,950
concept but there are practical concerns

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,440
we need to address before it can be

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,360
executed in this way so many options you

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,340
don't have to have it note perfect yet

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,130
but you do need to take a stay

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,980
standpoint some kind of move ahead thing

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,150
it just has to make sense for now

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,340
basically is what I'm getting at there

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,920
does that make sense so far

00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,990
two thumbs up did everyone enjoy lunch

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,680
by the way those turkey sandwiches

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,540
pretty good

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,870
we were lamenting the lack of cookies

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,630
but that's neither here nor there

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:47,640
step three is support without something

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,490
to support what you say your writing is

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,860
going to be thin and purposeless most

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,320
people will dismiss it very quickly so

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,830
build your foundation now you've got an

00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,170
idea

00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,610
and you've got that core idea really

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,200
kind of clear in your mind of what

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,330
you're gonna do you've written a topic

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,490
sentence I believe we should have

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,589
cookies after lunch for example would be

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,680
a great topic sentence that I would

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:12,779
write about it's time to start backing

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,210
that up and again you don't have to

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,890
write this second run to the library and

00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,390
hit the stacks and pull out all the old

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,890
archives and figure out all the

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,360
different things I obviously do not come

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,040
from a highly technical background as

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,730
I'm going to dusty old libraries and

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,339
pulling things out of stacks archives

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,720
but you do need to start thinking about

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,520
where your support points can come from

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,290
and again a lot of what I have

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,040
experienced when talking with people

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:39,330
about this step of the process is they

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,860
get really flummoxed like I don't even

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,810
know where to look or I don't know what

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,820
could qualify and there's - it's too

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,060
hard to find support this is a new idea

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,010
there are no support pieces for it but

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,010
support can come in a lot of flavors so

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,080
I think we maybe get a little too bogged

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,480
down with the formalities of what we

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,280
think a supporting piece could be it

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,040
doesn't always need to be academic

00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,170
research double-blind studies supported

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,050
by a number of years of scientific

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,120
endeavor it can be a lot of different

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,200
things and in particular it can be a lot

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,930
of different things when we're writing

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,610
about new ideas and we're writing online

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,890
for the web like those are different

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,180
forms of writing than contributing to an

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,140
academic journal and if you want to

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,089
contribute to an academic journal

00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,850
encourage you to do so and I'm very

00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,730
impressed

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,060
but starting with these components will

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,769
make it easier so things like anecdotal

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,720
observations still count as support

00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,670
points if you are in a meeting and the

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,339
meetings going poorly and you observe

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,410
that it's going poorly because x y&z

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:42,019
happened that's worthwhile information

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,300
you have personal insight into this

00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:45,860
topic of why meetings go badly because

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,230
you've experienced it that's that's

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,569
worthwhile to note there's articles

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,449
there's interviews there's news items

00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:55,250
other blogs that kind of thing if you

00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:57,079
can cite the publication a recently

00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,730
talked about this phenomenon that people

00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,620
had reported in their meetings and how

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,149
terrible they are that's another that's

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,760
another resource point and you're not

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,789
alone again you've got more voices

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,010
backing up that concept studies academic

00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:13,970
research that kind of thing study one

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,740
said that they tested 10,000 interview

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,630
subjects on this and every time a

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,339
meeting started without a template it

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,459
all fell to garbage and they hated it

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,260
that's a good research point so you know

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,439
it can like I say doesn't have to be

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,659
just highly cited things studies are

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,549
great worth having but talk to

00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,419
colleagues interview people all kinds of

00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:34,700
different stuff is worthwhile for

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:36,409
support so really I would say expand out

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:43,130
your concept of what you can use for

00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:45,350
support step for practical advice you've

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,970
got a great article idea shaping up I

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,130
can feel it already you can see the

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,840
gears charting in your heads people are

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,330
gonna be interested in what you have to

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,850
say let's give them a little more than

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,200
just that idea because again we want to

00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,280
make sure we're keeping that through

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,100
line of interest that we're pulling

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,929
people in and carrying on so give

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:09,230
something people to take with them load

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,280
the next step is to find some tips and

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,409
solutions things that are applicable to

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,470
their own life it's great to gripe but

00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:18,559
come up with solutions meetings go awry

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,700
because there's no template and one

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,320
person stands at the front of the room

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,260
like a real blowhard and talks endlessly

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,000
and then there's no takeaway steps at

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,559
the end that's one thing they're gonna

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,030
learn meetings go awry because of three

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,600
separate reasons another thing they

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:34,010
learn there's tangible benefits to

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,590
eradicating this problem

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,200
including more productive work time more

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,820
engaged employees clearer outcomes and

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,920
objectives for everyone great now

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,810
they've learned why things go awry and

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,350
what they're gonna get by improving the

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:50,060
situation we can skip meetings sorry not

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,120
we can skip we can stop meetings from

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,550
going awry by doing these three things

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,780
we've got new meeting templates we've

00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,060
issued for everyone and they have to use

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,740
them we time box everything so that no

00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,110
one has to be wasting time for more than

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,700
25 minutes and off we go we've got

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,140
takeaway items that everyone has to fill

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,760
out a form at the end now we've got

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,890
three practical ways to improve meetings

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,320
so people are getting all kinds of

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,400
information from these takeaways now

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
obviously this is a very specific

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,970
example and you're not going to be

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,470
talking about meetings and templates

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,970
because everyone has covered that topic

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,220
and you're more interesting than I am

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,720
but you get the idea you want to give

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,270
people things that they can take with

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,100
them when they're done so that they've

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,170
actually gotten something out of giving

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,570
you 5-10 minutes of their time reading

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,710
through your piece I created this Drupal

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,450
component and here's the thing it does

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:40,940
wonderful amazing stuff now they know

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,560
and Step five

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,190
the final step and this is the only one

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,960
I would say is one you could call non

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,160
essential but it's only going to help

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,350
you and technically as part of the

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,570
writing process anyway is to write a

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,070
teaser it's less daunting than writing

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,600
the whole thing and it'll help you get

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,400
into the flow of writing so it's very

00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,840
worthwhile step which is why we have it

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,900
as part of the process even if I would

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,850
technically describe it as non-essential

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,970
take a baby step in the direction of

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:10,430
writing writing the whole thing which is

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,500
a lot is kind of more than you need to

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,210
take on if you're not ready yet so write

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,890
a little teaser and that should be a

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,470
length that's about the length of a

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,820
tweet or a paragraph so we're looking

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,560
when I initially created the egg wit

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,410
tweets we're still 140 characters so

00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,540
literally just a very tight sentence but

00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,520
we can say 280 characters now if you

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,260
want up to maybe five or six hundred

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,570
characters like we're not talking a huge

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:37,370
lot of writing very couple of sentences

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:39,230
is all we need here you want to be sorry

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,310
remember that you've also created a mad

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,030
libs setup for your

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:45,770
so you can just kind of plug in the

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,480
information you already have in a

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,650
paragraph four minute very

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,270
straightforward you know what your topic

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,620
sentence roughly is going to be maybe

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,920
you've adjusted it maybe you haven't

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,420
that sentence number one and then you

00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,250
already know what support points are

00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,390
gonna do so you can highlight those or

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,670
loosely reference that you're gonna be

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,930
highlighting a few points and then you

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,810
know the things you want people to get

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,640
out of your article so you can say we'll

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,170
explore this and we'll take away a

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,790
couple of things that's your whole

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,860
paragraph you're done it's amazing so

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:17,690
easy you've already written a synopsis

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:21,920
for yourself what a wonderful thing my

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:24,260
example meetings are often cited as the

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,120
scourge of the workplace scourge is one

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,190
of my favorite word's inefficient

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,300
disorganized in a massive time suck but

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,920
we know we need them to get our teams

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,020
aligned and keep us all pulling in the

00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,550
same direction so what causes meeting

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,260
derailment and how can we bring them

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,670
back on track I've given you so much

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,230
information about what to expect from

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,060
this article you know I've already

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,500
researched all these components a little

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,900
bit mentally and a little bit actively

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,880
to make sure I can back those statements

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,680
up I'm way to the races this is

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,940
wonderful

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,210
that's the eggwin that's the whole of it

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,080
you guys those five steps think

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,480
something that bugs you something you

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,060
really admire respect really dig into

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,280
those topics and then do write that

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,770
topic sentence figure out how you're

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,840
gonna support that topic sentence figure

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,220
out some components to back or sorry to

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,510
give people that they can take on the

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,820
road with them once they finished

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,230
reading and then write a little

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,030
introductory paragraph so that you've

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,680
got it clear in your mind before you get

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,380
to writing how you're going to navigate

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,890
these topics that's the whole of the a

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,380
quit so the final tip section that I

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,080
promised you that is as long as the

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,790
regular eggwin section

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,050
I know writing is kind of a foreign new

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,150
thing for a lot of people and even for

00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,680
people who do a lot of writing in their

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,410
everyday lives sometimes we forget I

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,450
often actively forget some of the more

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,640
basic stuff so some of this may be quite

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,590
drying and boring for some of you some

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,870
of you might find it new and novel who

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,180
knows I don't know your backgrounds fill

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,500
in the blanks no more prep it's time to

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,450
start writing

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,460
if you followed the steps of the egg wet

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,870
you should have a pretty firm base off

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,470
of which to base your writing it's

00:22:53,870 --> 00:23:01,490
essentially outline creation but with a

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:04,280
very clear template in mind remember

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,919
that writing is hard that's a tip that

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,600
always surprises me that my colleagues

00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,240
are taken aback that I struggle to write

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,530
that I get writer's block that I hammer

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,059
my head against the keyboard for like

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,850
three or four hours a day trying to get

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,080
a couple of paragraphs done because I

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,659
think people who aren't in the habit of

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,940
writing regularly believe that those

00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:25,070
that are have this like innate ability

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,510
to just craft words endlessly it's a

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,940
struggle it takes a lot of effort and

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,440
energy so give yourself a break it's a

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,610
normal part of the process to come up

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,490
against the wall and find yourself

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,490
struggling to finish it but don't give

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,780
up entirely because then that is you're

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,760
not gonna get any writing done that way

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,780
so just remember that it's hard and be

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,330
okay with yourself be a little bit

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,470
gentle with yourself on that and

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,750
remember that it doesn't have to be

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,510
perfect especially not your first draft

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,429
and getting that first draft done Oh

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,750
buddy that's the secret sauce right

00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,760
there if you can get that first draft

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,900
done it's already written all you have

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,700
to do at that point is start refining

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,580
and editing you can call on lots of a

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,230
help at that point as well so get that

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,820
first draft done and don't worry about

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,870
whether or not it's exactly the way you

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,850
want it to be because you're not

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,380
publishing a first draft ever and if you

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,250
are please stop doing that right now

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,250
it's a very bad idea

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,740
additional tips this is why the tip

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,289
section goes on so long you guys there's

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,270
like three pages of additional tips

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:22,700
editing is your friend I alluded to it

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,080
already but write it all out get it all

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,090
down pat yourself on the back that's the

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,580
hardest part of the process for sure but

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,830
then edit the Dickens out of it editing

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,919
cannot be overstated as important it is

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,890
the surest way to make it a readable

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,960
piece of content you will find a lot

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,840
through even just a single edit and I

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,750
recommend usually two or three some tips

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,970
read it out loud if you read it out loud

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,010
you'll slow yourself down and you will

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,200
catch things you might have missed we

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,780
have a tendency to jump to what our

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,860
brains know we wanted to say and so

00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:00,049
we'll miss putting the after the is not

00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,549
usually correct but if you read it out

00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,250
loud you will see that because your

00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,900
brain when you're

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,540
has to go a little bit slower has to

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,400
actually catch that stuff if you pass it

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,530
along to others to review you will also

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,330
find the same thing they'll catch things

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,770
that you might have missed they'll catch

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,270
things that don't make sense because you

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,880
know what you were trying to say and

00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,980
they don't already and they'll catch

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,140
stuff like a thathe that your brain will

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,850
have skipped over that they because it's

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,390
the first time seeing it won't skip over

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,160
and if you edit it a few times which you

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,710
should be doing just make sure you leave

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,970
a little space between edits because

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,500
your brain gets tired and you get

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,270
familiar with the content and if you

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,440
give yourself a break between the edits

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,370
you're gonna be in that much better

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,810
shape fresh eyes matter additional tips

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,060
part 2 this is the last of the tips I

00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:47,550
swear online writing which is a little

00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,140
bit more specific and certainly more my

00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,520
area of expertise I'm not gonna be a

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,310
great resource for you if you want to

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,990
publish in academic journals that online

00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,420
writing is a little bit different than

00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,890
academic writing it's less formal I

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,960
think we can all probably have guessed

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,310
that and there are a few things to keep

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,540
in mind and this is probably stuff

00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,420
you're already going to know from your

00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,940
experience doing being online ever

00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:12,150
reading online developing that kind of

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,470
thing writing tips for online sections

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,610
help gave yourself section headers

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,170
that's going to be an easy way for

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:19,110
people to break up the content it allows

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:21,260
them to scan really easily to understand

00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,030
it better

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,550
keep it short I'm obviously very bad at

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,160
that I had three pages of bonus tips so

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,690
I'm not great at short content but short

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,160
sentences short paragraphs if you keep

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,230
it short people again are gonna get it

00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,210
it's much easier for them to digest it

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,920
and the final thing is that images

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,900
matter more than you realize we

00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,030
typically want to aim for about one

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,750
every 300 words which sounds like a lot

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:48,560
that's like one per chunk of minimal

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,820
text I'm asking you to write off the top

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,620
people don't actually like reading very

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,690
much which is you know for me as a

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,040
writer not super great news but for

00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,840
everyone else who is maybe a little

00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,690
uncomfortable with writing kind of great

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,250
news so do try and find relevant images

00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,110
there's lots of free image galleries out

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,360
there I would encourage especially if

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,790
you're doing things that explain kind of

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,770
complex architectural concepts to just

00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,670
have like an easy diagram that breaks it

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,710
up from time to time

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,830
it helps solidify the concept for people

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,390
and it's so much so much easier

00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,559
threw a huge chunk of text if you can

00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,450
take that break every once in a while

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,710
and then of course make sure you're

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,299
adding the alt text make sure you're

00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,260
making that clear so that all audiences

00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:29,630
have the ability to go through it

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:33,019
comprehensively how are we doing for

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:36,649
time it is 242 which means I'm probably

00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:38,570
no time for exercise writing if I'm not

00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:41,779
mistaken but you know what to do now

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,850
give it a whirl step one think why does

00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:44,990
it matter what's the heart of topic what

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,580
are the things that you want to be

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:50,600
getting out of this if you were reading

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:52,580
it as the writer step to do find that

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,470
central topic find that thesis it

00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,200
doesn't have to be perfect it just has

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,720
to be something

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,250
step 3 do more you want to come up with

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,620
your three support points they don't

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,630
have to be all super well research

00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,380
studies but find those things that let

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,549
you know that you've got something to

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,159
talk about something that you can

00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:15,049
reference and refer to they can be blogs

00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,710
magazine articles anecdotal evidence all

00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,799
that kind of stuff

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:21,710
step 4 do even more so much doing in

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,149
this think about the practical tips the

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,950
things you want people to take away from

00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:26,090
it and it doesn't all have to be tips it

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,440
can just be learnings or new

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,210
understandings but think about the

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,860
things you want people to have gotten

00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,120
out of having read this piece that

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,240
you've written that you've spent a lot

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:38,059
of time crafting and then Step five more

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,580
more more more doing just write that

00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:42,470
little chunk write that little bit so

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,330
that you kind of give yourself the

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,500
confidence to know you can write and so

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,830
that you've got something ready to go

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:51,649
written go right you're all set

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,549
got a solid outline because you've got a

00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:55,820
clear idea

00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:58,940
check support points check takeaways

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,380
Jack that's the good one and some actual

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,360
words to get the ball rolling which will

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,929
give you the confidence to finish that

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,929
up you're all sorted that's it

00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:07,929
questions

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,090
so there's a couple of different things

00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,250
as I understand it DrupalCon

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,990
all Drupal cons but Drupal con Nashville

00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,370
as well we'll have this presentation so

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,170
you'll be able to refer back to it you

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,490
probably won't want to refer back to it

00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,860
necessarily in which case I would

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:27,470
strongly recommend going to the my

00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,840
planet blog which is on medium because

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,360
about two weeks ago I did a condensed

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,310
version of these slides that you will be

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,890
able to access there so you'll be able

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:39,520
to walk through the egg went online and

00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,520
then you can guide yourself through it

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,520
yes

00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:52,019
yeah so that's a great question if the

00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,370
writers an expert in their field does it

00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:55,529
reduce the amount of support you need

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:58,049
the three support points and the three

00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,159
practical takeaways are guidelines you

00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:02,129
don't want to overwhelm people with

00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,570
content you also don't want to leave

00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:05,039
them wanting more

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,769
but if you're someone in your field who

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,919
knows you know my colleague Everett was

00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:12,720
the Drupal 7 site maintainer for

00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,999
accessibility if I'm not mistaken if I

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,830
was gonna write a topic a Content piece

00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:18,289
on that topic he probably has enough

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,309
expertise to be able to speak

00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:21,929
convincingly to it and yes certainly

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:23,999
that would reduce the need if I'm gonna

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,320
write about that topic I absolutely need

00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:27,210
to be referencing someone like Everett

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,129
as opposed to just relying on my own leg

00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,110
I think it's important which it is but

00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:34,679
not super relevant to the people who are

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:36,509
gonna be reading any other questions

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,999
we're already in this room change over

00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:40,289
these are tight sessions a thank you so

00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:41,909
much you guys I'm gonna go through these

00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:45,570
last things don't forget to join for

00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:47,580
contribution sprints and also comment on

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:51,070
what you thought of Drupal con Nashville

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:55,559
I have no said my piece thank you

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,559
[Applause]

00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,220
