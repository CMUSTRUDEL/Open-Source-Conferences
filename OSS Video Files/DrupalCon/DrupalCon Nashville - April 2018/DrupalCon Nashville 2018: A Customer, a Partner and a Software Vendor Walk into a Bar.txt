The goal of any tourism site is to inspire visitors to travel and explore a particular region. TNVacation.com faced the challenge of inspiring prospective Tennessee visitors with all the state has offer - from activities to geography - through relevant content across their existing website.  Their overly complex system of content tagging and navigation made it extremely difficult for visitors to find information that was useful and inspirational for their trip planning.
