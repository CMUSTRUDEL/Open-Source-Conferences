Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: A Customer, a Partner and a Software Vendor Walk into a Bar
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	How does a customer engage a services provider and software vendor in a partnership to achieve long term sustained success. Learn their about their pains, the solution, the integration and the future.

The goal of any tourism site is to inspire visitors to travel and explore a particular region. TNVacation.com faced the challenge of inspiring prospective Tennessee visitors with all the state has offer - from activities to geography - through relevant content across their existing website.  Their overly complex system of content tagging and navigation made it extremely difficult for visitors to find information that was useful and inspirational for their trip planning.
We will discuss how D8’s easy component-based content authoring, combined with Lift’s robust personalization engine, allowed Tennessee Tourism to:

Re-design their architecture to build connections across content types
Deliver targeted content to site visitors based on explicit and implicit behaviors
Increase average session duration by 29 percent and decrease bounce rate by 19 percent

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,840
for you to be here I know the title was

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,960
what gripped you and welcome to the bar

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,990
so I'm gonna start right out of the gate

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,860
with some introductions of my guests

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,910
here in this session for you and what

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,600
I'd like to do is have them all

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,700
introduce themselves and their roles and

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,950
then what we'll do is we're going to go

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,079
into a little bit of a discussion about

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,469
this journey we've been on here in

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,949
Tennessee and hopefully for everybody

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,820
some real insights into into how that

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,949
has given some great results to the

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,289
tourism department but also some lessons

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,390
learned and one of the things that we're

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,610
particularly interested in is so the

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,630
dynamic between particular for Brian who

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,729
introduced himself in a second the

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,200
dynamic existed between all the

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,010
different constituents and customers

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,920
that he has to serve both internal and

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,970
external and hopefully that will come

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,950
across a little bit of what we share

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,680
with you today and then we do have some

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,920
time at the end for some questions so

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,930
hopefully we will inspire you to give us

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,850
some tough ones all right so with that

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,970
being said maybe Brian we could start

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,880
with you introduction and role and what

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,950

for VML and was actually on the design

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,860
team and so the role that I played in

00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,190
the project was helping us with problem

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,319
definition really digging into okay what

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,349
do we need to solve for whatever we

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,420
create this thing and then working with

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:45,100
the user experience team to make sure

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,930
that we build something that tied

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,390
everything together both front end to

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,000

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,920
experience awesome great thank you

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,470
everybody so Brian let's start with you

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,850
as sort of the the real customer here

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,310
I'd love if you could share with

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,190
everybody at a very high level what were

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,470
some of the objectives that were set out

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:09,010
for this project as you thought about

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:13,630
what success would look like certainly

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:17,709
so I joined the department about two and

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,780
a half years ago agency vml had already

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,200
been in place for about a year and a

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,959
half and we'll get into how they were

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,989
selected to be the agency of record for

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,450
the state tourism department but once I

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,450
came on board and started really digging

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,730
around into what the programs were for

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,900
the department the marketing campaigns

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,359
and then the website and what I found

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,030
was we were doing a whole lot of really

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:49,870
cutting-edge digital marketing with high

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,000
quality creative campaigns and we were

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,920
sending everyone to a website and it was

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,519
like her

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,900
this website is massive even if I know

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,239
what I'm looking for

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,769
it's hard to find it it's like drop down

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,140
after drop down after drop down after

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,150
out on you know I mean you know finally

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,130
one day I actually got a call from our

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,170
Parks Department Tennessee we have like

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,410
56 state parks you know it's obviously a

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,239
big tourism asset that we have and there

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,709
was an issue with one of their pages and

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,169
their marketing director called me up

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,549
and said hey it's such Park and I was

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:23,979
like okay well let me go to the website

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,210
I'll go to that page and see what the

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,190
issue is and try to fix it

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,500
so I knew exactly what I was looking for

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,810
and I started going through the website

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,360
and I couldn't find the damn page I was

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,330
like where is it you know so I was like

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,039
this this website is just too big it's

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:44,319
not a good user experience and we we

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,500
need to redo it so just to put that in

00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,120
context you know Todd was really happy

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,699
but everyone's looking around at me

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,520
because they had just Reap lat formed or

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,669
they were nearly done rhe platforming

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,389
this site that was built on a custom CMS

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:03,940
system with the previous ad agency into

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,860
Drupal and normally that's not exactly

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,419
how you want to go about doing a web

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,789
design right like I want to basically

00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,340
blow up the site and totally redo it and

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:15,250
they've just finished taking this beast

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:19,449
in all the pages on it and putting it

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:22,599
into the drupal platform so you know it

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,370
is what it is we did it anyway and found

00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:29,050
the money and we'll get into how that

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,669
happened - I'm gonna move this to the

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,110
next slide although we're not we're not

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,120
gonna talk about that just yet because

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,210
it looks like there's a video playing in

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,370
that slide she's got some voice so video

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,060
on your slides and websites is really

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,650
important so I'm one of the things we

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,940
talked about leading up to this Bryan or

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,550
maybe you can have is you you inherited

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,800
that and and I don't know if you you had

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,270
to deal with this or maybe you can speak

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,219
to with your team and your colleagues

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,449
how this was how this was address but I

00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,610
think one of the challenges often is

00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:01,449
just getting everybody internally to

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,490
agree or at least to agree to allow you

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,009
to move forward and and that question of

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,810
alignment becomes becomes difficult and

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,759
I think probably everybody who's try to

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,740
do that in an organization may have had

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,900
struggles so how how is that

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,780
accomplished within an organization like

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:22,240
yours how did everybody get to say okay

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:26,349
we agree let's go do that that's a good

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,060
question so first of all I had had by

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:32,139
him from my boss right we all have a

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,659
boss my direct supervisor is

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,070
Commissioner Kevin Triplett so he's the

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,190
commissioner he's a cabinet member for

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,370
the governor

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,920
and he had only started at the

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,950
department I don't know not even a year

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,020
before I came on board you know so so he

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,840
came in and then hired me and it's been

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:56,920
a bit of a reorganization for the

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:59,480
department we also have to deal with a

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,890
tourism committee kind of like a task

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,560
force if you will you know you hear

00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:07,640
those that in government well our

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,380
Governor Bill Haslam after talking to

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,910
people in the tourism industry and mine

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,350
gee tourism is the second biggest

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,170
industry in the state of Tennessee

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,540
behind agriculture the economic impact

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,200
for tourism in our state last year was

00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,090
nineteen point three billion dollars

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,610
collecting revenues of 1.7 billion

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,330
dollars for our state we are a state

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,330
with no income tax so tourism is really

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,400
important right so our governor I guess

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,320
after he'd been in a couple of years

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,580
he's at the end of his eight-year term

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,920
now he put together the Tennessee

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,440
tourism committee and this is about 40

00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,050
some-odd members from across the state

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,300
from our bigger CVB's and bigger

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,669
attractions in Tennessee we actually

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,790
have five big drivers Memphis Nashville

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,440
Knoxville Chattanooga and then severe

00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,090
County which is kind of where the Great

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,460
Smoky Mountain National Park is yep

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,020
Dollywood and all that and we've got

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,490
Graceland and Dollywood and Jack Daniels

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,650
and the Grand Old Opry we've got some

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,260
pretty big attractions here so we're we

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,450
are product rich right so that's that's

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,690
all good but so we have this committee

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,060
and we meet with them a few times a year

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,040
and you know they kind of drove the

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,980
strategic plan for the state well we'll

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,700
get into that but basically I sold it to

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:27,290
my boss I think internally certainly at

00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,510
the agency people were really excited

00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:35,330
that I was considering redoing the

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:38,500
website and every every year we do a big

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:41,120
co-op program with our big five

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,160
destination partners and that are those

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,060
five cities that I just mentioned or

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,560
five destinations so that's like

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,690
$100,000 match

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,070
with each of them so we put in a half

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,520
million in each of them puts in a

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,560
hundred thousand and we do various TV

00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,720
campaigns or digital campaigns or to

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,660
have you each year um that we can tailor

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,830
for each of them well my boss and I

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,720
basically went on a tour so to speak

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,440
talking to these people and basically

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,880
saying hey you know on one hand we

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,380
weren't that thrilled how the co-op

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,000
program had gone the year before but we

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,690
asked them we said look we'd like to

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,720
take half of this money from our budget

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,430
$250,000 from the budget and put it

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,710
towards a new website for the state

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,470
because we feel that this website that

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,900
we have is not on par with the caliber

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,620
of work that we are doing for the state

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,780
tourism brand and home it really helped

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,100
it was a validation I'll never forget we

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,790
were sitting in a meeting with our

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,640
severe county partners and this woman

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,810
sukar from Pigeon Forge as soon as I got

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,060
done saying look we'd like to steer this

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:57,080
disinvestment towards a new website

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,910
she said bless you she said Brian I have

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,770
been praying for you that you would get

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,410
a new website because your website is

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,180
awful and I was like in that point my

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,890
boss was like okay this is gonna go well

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,990
we're gonna be able to do this you know

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,090
so we we talked to all the partners we

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,500
got that buy-in you know it's almost

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,240
like it's not really a board of

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,580
directors but it's definitely a strong

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,620
advisory committee for us so it's like I

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,600
had to get my boss then we literally

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,840
drove you know men around the state and

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,440
talk to these people and everybody was

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,180
on board and and then we you know gave

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,400
Todd the good news because he was trying

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,190
to make the old site work right so he

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,320
has been going through platforming this

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:41,600
this website that had it was just

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,000
massive and it really you can't polish a

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,420
turd I mean what you gonna say that's

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,340
that's a good way to put it so so I want

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,610
to bring Todd and then in a minute Chris

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,170
into this so you mentioned that you

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,540
already had the relationship with vml

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,060
but but how did that you know selecting

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,540
your partner's is hard to do

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,300
it's where to start

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,680
you know what exactly you're looking for

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,770
capabilities cultural fit all that sort

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,630
of stuff how how was how was vm else

00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,560
like it had it how did you go about that

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:16,350
as an organization so that same

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,170
tennessee tourism committee they and got

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,820
together and went through a lot of

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,100
planning sessions and developed a

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,920
strategic plan for the state it was

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,810
published in 2013 i mean you go online

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,300
and look at it but really identifying

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,510
what the main pillars are for the state

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,510
of tennessee that drive tourism and and

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,310
then they coalesced around a brand which

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,500
at the time was made in tennessee and

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,510
became soundtrack of america main

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,180
tennessee because you know our state is

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,130
so diverse you know memphis on the

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,650
mississippi river in West Tennessee is

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,060
totally different from Nashville totally

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,070
different from the Smokey Mountains so

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,020
that had always been a challenge it was

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,490
really like every time a new agency came

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,380
in they came up with a new brand it was

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,180
usually kind of hokey and very country

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,800
music leaning and so where does that

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,480
leave Memphis you know home of the blues

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,580
and birthplace of rock and roll or the

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,530
Smoky Mountain so it was the first time

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,540
that that level of effort had gone into

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,730
developing the strategic plan and there

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,210
was actually some of those industry

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:18,000
leaders on the panel that judged the

00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,190
proposals when the RFP went out but part

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,360
of that strategic plan was to find a

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:27,870
global agency like a high-caliber global

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,700
agency to take Tennessee tourism to the

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,950
to the next low because along with all

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,230
this work came a much bigger investment

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,360
from the state into tourism you know I

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,980
think if they had a budget of about four

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,180
and a half million dollars to spend on

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,390
marketing and you know that was

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,040
increased to you know about twelve

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:48,810
million dollars so it's a much much

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:51,030
higher level spin and then VML you know

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,730
again I wasn't in the room I came on

00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,520
after but become very familiar with how

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,080
it all went down they actually put one

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,720
of the guys who worked on our project

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,270
Ben was Ben's last name Herman Herman

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,850
Ben Grameen and in another group they

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,250
actually got in a van and drove around

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,710
the state of Tennessee and took video

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,379
and took photos like they really wanted

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,849
the business

00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:16,179
they demonstrated that and basically

00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:19,029
blew away the competition and were

00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:21,369
selected to be the agency of record so

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,139
that's basically how PML came on board

00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:27,369
go ahead talk and we're actually there

00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:29,349
well partially so you know from a

00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:31,509
technology side we were kind of watching

00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:33,789
a little bit from the sidelines there

00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,159
were these just amazing creative pieces

00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:38,049
and like you know everybody in the

00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,789
agency was buzzing about it and we're

00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,289
all excited and then you know was

00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:44,169
announced that we won in every was like

00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:46,779
yeah and then they're like oh and they

00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:47,949
just replac formed onto a custom CMS and

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,479
this is the website you're gonna be

00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:54,819
living with for several years and worse

00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:56,739
like instantly deflated and and at that

00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:58,659
time the existing Commissioner and

00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:00,459
assistant commissioner like Brian

00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:04,449
mentioned there's been a lot of turnover

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,739
in those positions you know they just we

00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:09,159
just did this so we're not really

00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:11,019
interested in it so you know we did like

00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:12,129
you mentioned go through a interim Reap

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,919
lat forming stage where we basically

00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:17,019
took the existing site and mostly set it

00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,629
on Drupal and that was just to make life

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:22,439
a little bit easier because it was a

00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:25,179
totally custom no security patches no

00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:27,819
support at all CMS I'm not sure why

00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,859
anybody would do that but but we did go

00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:31,209
through that so it was nice when it was

00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:32,649
wonderful and Brian came on like he said

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,479
I mean it's like a party it was like yes

00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,709
we finally get to do it you wait finally

00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:38,350
get to do it justice we've seen these

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:41,139
these amazing like commercials and

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,809
videos and it's like our site is just

00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:46,239
like I'm gonna show it to people so it

00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:49,139
was great so so we here at Drupal con so

00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:51,369
so you mentioned custom to Drupal but

00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,979
vml has got deep experience in many

00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:56,199
technologies you have to for the

00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:57,850
business you're in so what what led you

00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,929
to think about Drupal and using Drupal

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,639
here and then I know you added some

00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,609
personalization so how did you make

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,679
technology decisions what drove that

00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:08,289
well so you know the decision to use

00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:11,589
Drupal in some respects was made really

00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:14,319
before you know vml was supposed select

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,269
as a partner you know we have at VML we

00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,979
have a couple different platforms we

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:19,779
tend to gravitate to you know just to

00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:21,579
sort of standardize and keep different

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,140
text x going different clients have

00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:27,020
requirements sometimes we're just forced

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,140
to to deal with those requirements I

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,720
will say you know I actually started BML

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:37,060
as a c-sharp developer and one of my

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,300
first project was a Drupal 6 site and

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,570
looked at school II and fell in love

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,730
with it so and I've worked on other

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,160
technologies I'm not gonna not gonna go

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,570
into those but I will say you know I

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,690
don't probably sell Drupal to the people

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,720
in this room but very extensible great

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:59,360
for content authors I mean we is the the

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,520
the speed to market is so much greater

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,230
compared to to other platforms I've

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,350
worked with well it I'll add to that

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,600
it's the experience I know that from a

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:12,710
design standpoint we like to collaborate

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,590
with our clients with our devs with the

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,970
business people and just right off the

00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,950
bat we were empowered to be able to do

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,050
that because the content authoring

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,370
experience is good most of the time

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,800
that's what your ultimate business

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,150
clients team is going to see so it's

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,190
very comfortable coming and go we're

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,800
going to do this and we know that you're

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,480
going to have a good experience and so

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,550
that was one of the things where we were

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
super excited what's like great we know

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,330
that we did this pseudo shift and lift

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,390
but now we've got the opportunity to

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,340
actually do the brand right with the

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,560
inspiring content and make sure that

00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,790
Bryan's team wasn't you know they were

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,380
gonna have it I'm not gonna call

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,000
delightful but they were gonna have a

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,880
positive authoring experience because

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,050
for this to be successful we were it

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,270
couldn't be a one-and-done where the

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,190
content just published once yeah we were

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,530
going to have to go after it was with

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:04,190
some tenacity and I think the proofs in

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:08,780
the pudding what 50 updates a month no

00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:10,610
actually I we have an outreach team that

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,910
works with all of our partners and in

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:16,610
the foundation of this site is our

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,589
partner pages and that's attractions and

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,880
different destinations from across the

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,790
whole state of Tennessee there's a high

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,100
density of that right so we needed them

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,110
to update all of their partner pages

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,880
through this process so we sent out a

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,500
lot of communication I mean literally

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,530
our outreach team traveled across the

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,960
state having workshops on the new

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,030
website we made a video on how to

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,820
have a good partner Paige I mean we made

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,040
a couple videos like to get them excited

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,950
about it and got it out there and and

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,810
actually help these people so over the

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,840
course of launching the site in the few

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:56,430
months following we had fought we so we

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,650
we killed about 3000 like partner pages

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,600
that didn't really have any content on

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,870
them from the old site and we had over

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,210
500 newly created or updated partner

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,890
pages just over that launch and when I

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,720
talked to the team this morning who has

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,210
as they said it's about a hundred a

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,030
month that they either have update

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,790
mostly updated or added new partner

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,430
pages which is just a much higher level

00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,320
of engagement than we ever had with our

00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,360
partners before cuz yeah I mean you have

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,300
to have all of that content it's gotta

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,610
be good content yeah good well and I was

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,900
gonna this will probably kind of merge a

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,210
little bit into it what we're gonna talk

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,740
about next but you know starting off on

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,420
the right foot but you know we went

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,520
through an exercise of kind of defining

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,760
goals and KPIs and and kind of

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,630
understanding where team vacations

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,880
position should be on the internet

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,250
should it be another Travelocity should

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,810
it be something else right and and we

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,620
decided it should not be a Travelocity

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:55,650
thankfully but that they're very very

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,560
high in in kind of the consumer funnel

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,470
right from from like dreaming being

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,000
inspired there that's where they live

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,710
and then down here Travelocity is where

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,210
I'm booking and that's we decided that

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,730
didn't really make sense to try to

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,990
shoehorn that into their site and that's

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,910
where we were talking about a partner

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,190
selection you know one of the other

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,280
benefits of going with aqueous that we

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,450
knew about the aqua live platform

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,700
because also because of the higher

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,780
mobile adoption rates and just trying to

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:27,240
deliver more relevant content quicker

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:30,000
the lift platform then allowed us to to

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,340
really get personalization going very

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,290
quickly and kind of free up the dev team

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,600
to work on some some other enhancements

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,550
that we wanted like content scoring and

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,920
trending articles and stuff like that

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,210
which we may talk about later so that

00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,280
was another important part of that

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,390
selection process got it and Chris maybe

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,610
you could comment on that because I know

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,260
you're kind of connecting the backend to

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,410
the experience on the front end so were

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,510
there other things beyond those

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,490
P is that were important ways you

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,750
thought about experience and some of the

00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,490
planning and the work shopping that you

00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,550
were doing with Brian or the team yeah

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,690
it sure did we do that we had to me the

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,090
promise we were making in the

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,240
marketplace with the campaign work and

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,100
how do you deliver on that and so we

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,070
believe heavily in work shopping and so

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,350
we spent two days over just up the hill

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,780
actually and what we wanted to drill

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,120
into was okay let's have the kpi's

00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,640
discussion like let's really get into

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,130
what's the explicit behavior we're going

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,960
to expect to see from this particular

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,390
persona that we're going after right we

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,340
know we believe they exist we can

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,560
observe some behavior what does that

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,890
mean for us and then how do we pay that

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,110
off and so once we had the KPI alignment

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,120
and really kind of some hypotheses about

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:43,030
this is the behavior that we expect to

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,910
see we shifted very quickly into really

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,680
blowing out a bunch of user stories and

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:51,130
really doing your classic kind of scrum

00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,720
as a I want so that and we drilled into

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,820
that not only from the different

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,830
audience types if I correctly I think we

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,270
went through all the audience types we

00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,430
will hit them out in almost a day in a

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,420
life fashion right so what is something

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,220
that they're going to do once a year

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,260
what is something that they're gonna do

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,530
as they get closer to their trip how

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:11,290
could we impact that should we impact

00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,960
that and so we filled a room with

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,660
hundreds of four by six post-it notes

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,750
and then we kind of shifted the lens to

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,930
oK we've talked about this audience what

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,300
about our our client Brian right in the

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,100
Commissioner like what do you need from

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,230
this and we did user stories for them

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,820
and that's actually how we kind of

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,150
kicked off the the partner content

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:36,310
scoring discussion was whoa as a it'd be

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,590
great so that you know we essentially

00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,060
it's user-generated content and they

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,980
will get feedback and they will get

00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:45,610
feedback from smaller single owner

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:48,430
operators that okay how do I rank higher

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,590
I'm not ranking high enough and you know

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,640
he mentioned some of the other

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,710
entertainment properties in the state

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,990
how I can't compete with that well

00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,460
actually you can but you have to do it

00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,920
with good content that's updated

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,080
frequently so we were able to leverage

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,539
your poll to actually build a content

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,309
scoring system

00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:09,510
almost upvote those that do well and so

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,159
that was something we never would have

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,159
discovered if we hadn't sat in a room

00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,480
all day and we had a conversation if I

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,130
remember right it was like like a

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,529
lunchtime conversation we're like great

00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:22,710
let's blow that out and so then we added

00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:24,450
that to our set of stories and really

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,080
started doing the story mapping based on

00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,000
that Brian yeah I was just gonna say you

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,860
know I think some of the challenges with

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,919
though what the old site was it was

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,870
designed for our partners you know like

00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,940
they want to be able to go and find

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:43,320
themselves and have everything on there

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,960
and as a result we had like what 260

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,760
categories yeah that that were on the

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,889
site like you're not gonna go through

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,830
260 categories so the first thing these

00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:55,649
guys did was presented the actual like

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,269
site visits in pageviews and where

00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:59,789
people were spending time and it was on

00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:02,010
like a tenth of the site right so

00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:04,110
there's all so the partners can go find

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,610
themselves great but the users the

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,470
people were actually trying to inspire

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,510
to want to come visit Tennessee they're

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:13,320
not looking at all that so you know we

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,940
started with the data and then they led

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,490
us through a conversation was like okay

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,549
we want to take that from 260 content

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,980
categories down to like 40 you know to

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:25,350
make it manageable and then we started

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,919
talking about you know those content

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:31,730
stories like different types of content

00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,320
stories right so we have like articles

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,630
partner pages artists all the different

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,149
content types and you know that's where

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,549
we did the color coded sticky notes on

00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:43,980
the wall to think about through this and

00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:45,590
what category would that go into and how

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,059
are we going to serve that to the user

00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,889
so what how think it can discover it on

00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:53,340
their own or how are we going to use the

00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:56,399
aqueous ooh like all right you're from

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,429
st. Louis so geographically you're

00:23:56,399 --> 00:24:01,679
probably gonna come into West Tennessee

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:03,419
so we already know that about you but

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,460
then once you actually start clicking

00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,409
around we're gonna build a profile on

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,210
you and then serve you up content that

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:12,659
we think you might be interested in so

00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,850
if like you're into fishing and coming

00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,500
from the west we might show you a lake

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,980
or a river you know that that kind of

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,360
thing and

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,720
then I start getting out of that's like

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,429
the limit of my understanding but that

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,650
was the process and it was I mean it was

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:28,860
a couple days in a room with the sticky

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:32,490
notes and obviously it was you know was

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,450
really productive and beneficial good I

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,590
was gonna say I think the other key

00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,390
thing to that is if I recall correctly

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,100
like at the end of was at the end of day

00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,290
one or at the end of day two where the

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,870
Commissioner came in and we literally

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,690
pitched here's the direction that we're

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:49,169
going and so it wasn't where we you know

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,370
did laser lightshow power point or went

00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,620
to go ahead and build stuff at this

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,990
point all we had was sticky notes on a

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,820
wall and then we got up there and we

00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,020
literally walked through hears problems

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,570
that we're gonna solve are we solving

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,840
the right problems from your perspective

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,450
are we avoiding third are we negating

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,790
some other things does this work for you

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,490
what's your feedback and was just I was

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:14,280
overwhelmingly positive and it was you

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,980
know I think was the day - yeah it was

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,380
well I also say one thing is that we you

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,020
know basically designated Brian as the

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,390
key product owner and that was very

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,400
helpful because we did have a little bit

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,830
ring on a few things you know we have

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,919
regional managers and passionate

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,330
discussion there's some bickering but we

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,580
had we did it at the end of day have an

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,590
ultimate authority Brian made the final

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,270
decision so I think that was important

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,330
the process or else you just get mired

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,740
down and in arguments somebody has to

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,510
make that file that says they made that

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,059
clear that like we need one person who's

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,919
gonna own this and make decisions I mean

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,410
I did bring a couple other people into

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,900
the room but because you know we want to

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,160
get this thing done - but you know but

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,100
really interesting you see you had data

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,590
to begin with you looked at the facts as

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,390
opposed to people's opinions you you

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,669
started to think about internal

00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,140
customers versus external customers you

00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:08,700
know how the organization likes to think

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,860
of itself versus how the customer the

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,590
consumer wants to find information and

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,290
then you also had an exalted executive

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,850
sponsor early on whether whether they

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,830
were coming to check it out or you

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,350
invited them in kind of just very

00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,360
interesting - from an approach point of

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,610
view what you did very early on to try

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,049
and set yourselves up correctly

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,080
you know visibility of the executive the

00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:32,230
commissioner

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,900
and and those data points so so let's

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,420
let's let's let's move it along a little

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,100
bit of time so when we were preparing

00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,400
this we talked about crawl walk and run

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,990
and so how did we get started what were

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,540
some of the things that we were doing to

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,490
kind of begin on this process and

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,290
without trying to boil the ocean Chris

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,060
why don't you sort of start us off yeah

00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,950
yeah we really decided that we're gonna

00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,350
focus on okay we know that we have to

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,750
address the experiences question we know

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,450
that we have to address the geographic

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,010
question and then that's really what we

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,110
started to prioritize is how do we

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:07,510
really you know we're getting the people

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,510
coming in we need to inspire them and

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:12,550
then how do we not boil the ocean as you

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,290
put it because it's so easy to approach

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,210
personalization with yeah we could do

00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,830
this and we can do this and all of a

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,410
sudden you've got 60 different variables

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,360
and you don't know how you're going to

00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,220
produce them you're not sure how on the

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,430
client-side who has a staff to produce

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,610
those things like are you handing over

00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:32,560
something that they can even pay off and

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,500
so we went into it very diligently with

00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,990
let's do what we know from what the data

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,390
told us let's pay those select things

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,280
off let's do them very very well and so

00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:45,100
when we do get asked like you know what

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,920
was one of the the secret sauces that

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:51,580
went to the success of this digital

00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:55,210
experience it was really let's do a few

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,830
things supremely well and then the

00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,800
content scoring I think was the other

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:02,370
half of that of okay we know that we

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,590
cold out we pruned off the tree probably

00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:06,940
too severely but that that's a learning

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,630
that we learned over the course of a

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,640
year to drive folks for let's get better

00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,400
quality content and then let's elevate

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,040
those and then on the back end those

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,170
partners they get emails write your

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,210
reminders about doing your updates we

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,940
did a whole bunch of communication at a

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,610
time and I totally forgotten about the

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,810
video honestly

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,630
setting those people up and giving them

00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,970
empowering them to go here's why this is

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,910
important to you your success as a

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,430
partner is now part of responsible on

00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,120
you and we'll give you this mechanism

00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:44,100
for you having success through

00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,380
tapping into our connected digital

00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,510
experience right we've got amazing

00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,270
creative we're now moving them into our

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:54,150
own de property if you will your

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,740
visibility your success is up to you and

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,120
how did the Potters react to that I mean

00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,220
that's you know that's a there's a lot

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,130
of them and they feel that they should

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,929
be in charge of their departments so how

00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,679
did they react to what you were trying

00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:10,020
to do would drive that internal change

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,480
most of the feedback was overwhelmingly

00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:15,720
positive I mean the site looks great you

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,899
know the the imagery the you know all of

00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,490
the design Wow you know they were blown

00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:22,770
away and just to touch on that video

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,020
that was one of her and we have three

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,149
grand divisions in Tennessee each of

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,760
them we have a division manager you know

00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:33,330
there are outreach team dealing with all

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,270
of these partners and we one of them had

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,500
the idea give me a video so that we the

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,260
three of us aren't telling a different

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,960
story and our knowledge of how all this

00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,279
works is somewhat limited so give us the

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,770
tools to go out there and communicate

00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:51,029
that so so we did and that was very very

00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:53,520
helpful but you know we did anticipate

00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:56,250
and get into some partner conversations

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,590
that were you know there was a little

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:01,529
friction you know we knew going into it

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:04,380
like the tri-cities in East Tennessee

00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:07,679
you've got Bristol Johnson City and and

00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,419
Kingsport well when you look at our site

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,159
and it's divided by regions

00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:15,559
you know East Tennessee has a whole lot

00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:18,630
more you know cities and towns and in in

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,940
attractions than even middle and far

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:24,270
more than west but the way that the

00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,220
site's laid out like we can't feature we

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,200
already separated East Tennessee and

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,570
then like Smokies so they already had

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,179
you know seven instead of four or

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,679
whatever as far as the top-line but how

00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,840
do you deal with that and we decided to

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,100
go with featuring Bristol you know

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,140
because Bristol is a little bit bigger

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,149
city they have a higher economic impact

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,370
and do they have a stronger brand

00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:46,830
because of the Speedway and birthplace

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,289
of country music museum up there so so

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,059
we we did that knowing that it was going

00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:53,610
to cause consternation for those other

00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,800
partners in the in the tri-cities and we

00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,410
just we

00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,330
prepare for but we also talked through

00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,680
what was that criteria that set it apart

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,450
so that we were prepared for that

00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,160
partner communication sure enough a

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:07,160
couple months in the launch on the

00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,110
website get a call from Brenda whitson

00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,020
the head of the CVB up in Johnson City

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:15,490
and Bryan we have some major concerns

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:18,260
with your website you know so so she and

00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,540
enjoyed the guy from the Kingsport CVB

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,100
we get on a call and they're like you

00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,080
know we're looking around on here and we

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,610
look at our pages and we see you know

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,540
Bristol's called out why aren't we

00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,480
called out so we had that conversation

00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,520
then we're like well we see the Smoky

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,560
Mountains in in Knoxville and we think

00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,150
they're you know advertising as a part

00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,360
of this too you know people can pay to

00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:40,910
like boost their page on on some of

00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,860
these experience pages on our site like

00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,870
well they're buying up all this space

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,000
and everything so we talk through that

00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:49,400
they got the personal thing we got

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,710
through that and then Dave Jones our

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,330
East Tennessee division manager went up

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,340
and scheduled a meeting with them to

00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,360
really just talk through and take a look

00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,920
at their site and what they found was

00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,480
the attractions and restaurants and

00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,850
partners in Kingsport in Johnson City

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,770
didn't have partner pages they didn't

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,750
have the content that was needed on the

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:11,840
site to take up that real estate so it

00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:15,320
was being filled by other destinations

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,960
so he literally sat there with them and

00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,420
helped build partner pages had meet and

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,550
then they like rescheduled you know a

00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,710
meeting with all of the partners and

00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,330
help them build those partners so so

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,540
they could fill that void but you know

00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:33,610
is that level of effort you know really

00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:36,500
had to go against the total the buy-in

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,360
for this website you know which was just

00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,830
radically different from what they had

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,060
experienced before where they can just

00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,440
drop down and drop down and drop down

00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,910
hey there I am you know great well and

00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,250
to tell you this back to the whole crawl

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,330
walk run thing is you know to try not to

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,040
especially when you're personalizing

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,860
bite off more than you can chew at the

00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,480
beginning so really personalization

00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:00,650
especially if you're using something

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,960
like lyft to help you along the the it's

00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,990
not as much a technical issue as it

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,590
really is a Content issue and so when

00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,900
you start talking to

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,120
client or whoever about personalizing a

00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,740
site there's gonna be a lot of big ideas

00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,289
they're gonna want everything to be

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,830
personalized on every possible aspect of

00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:22,529
a visiting users profile but that's

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:25,289
that's not really realistic and if you

00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:27,350
get bogged down worrying about cap

00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:29,730
personalizing everything for everybody

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,400
then you really haven't personalized

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,779
anything at the end of the day probably

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,480
and you've made the effort so large

00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:39,630
you'll probably never launch so so pick

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,390
a couple things start small test revise

00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:45,179
make sure it's an ongoing project not

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:47,549
just a or ongoing effort not just a

00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:50,010
one-time project and keep at it get a

00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:52,919
schedule going you know make it good I

00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,299
mean get good at crawl then move into

00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,950
walk right because you know wall

00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,110
everybody says oh we're gonna do crawl

00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:01,049
walk run so like in three months we'll

00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,000
be a run right no to have the

00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,370
conversation with your clients and

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,960
actually understand how does that

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:09,450
content move around how do you just

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,179
support a personalization system and

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:14,940
then you have to design it so that the

00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,679
framework gets the content out there but

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,409
also gets them out in a way that they're

00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,460
successful rather than like every what

00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,859
you don't want to do is get into a

00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,740
situation where every month they're not

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:28,440
doing well yeah I would just say we're a

00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:31,349
year in and we're we're still making

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,020
adjustments you know get back into the

00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:36,960
content you know we same we may be cut

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,879
too much well you know SEO plays into a

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,589
lot of this too right like you got to

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,560
have a lot of good rich content and

00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:46,589
copying things on the site well we had

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,480
cut our events calendar from the site we

00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:50,580
kind of moved to almost having partner

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,429
pages for events like you know Bonnaroo

00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,810
is an annual event in all these

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,190
different festivals and things were

00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:59,490
annual events so they were kind of

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:01,140
evergreen but at this massive event

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,859
calendar that was on the site kind of

00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:07,050
went away well you know the SEO team

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:09,540
kind of came back and said well we cut

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,740
that and our site traffic drop turns out

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,960
you know that was one of our biggest

00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,359
drivers because there's no other entity

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,490
out there who's doing a statewide event

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,880
calendar you own that real estate you

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,400
got to bring

00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,440
that back you know so we did but that

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,270
was a lesson and we did hear from some

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,680
of the partners on that who were posting

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,750
events to our event calendar but we

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,960
brought it back and we also improved

00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,250
upon it by doing some custom API with

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,260
like Ticketmaster and things like that

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,420
so these bigger events were our auto

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,370
populating on our calendar and it's

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,800
actually a much more useful calendar

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,780
than just you know with all respect to

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,730
the zoo but they were putting you know

00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,470
they would populate it with like the

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,570
Easter egg hunt and the craft fair and

00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:52,680
like that was all you know you were seen

00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:54,450
and you weren't seen like Bruno Mars at

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,130
the Bridgestone Arena which might cause

00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,890
somebody to want to drive to Nashville

00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,050
and get a hotel room and stay so that

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,780
and then I think the terms of the lift

00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,490
we started with about 25% and we're just

00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,610
kind of like seeing how much

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,980
personalization should we add on the

00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:13,560
site and we're you know now that we're

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,420
kind of seeing what's happening we may

00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,100
dial that up a little bit more but you

00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,300
also have to have the content because

00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,600
otherwise they'll just serve the same

00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:24,060
thing got it so Todd how was all of this

00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,800
implemented it says not you know a lot

00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,150
of this start carefully get the

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,190
alignment but how did you actually go

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,530
about wiring the pieces together and

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,870
making it work well like I mentioned

00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:36,650
earlier so you know we started with well

00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:39,510
we actually had a Drupal 7 site so we

00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,430
decided to make the jump to Drupal 8 we

00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,250
felt like the time was right

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:46,500
it had matured enough modules were

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,480
maturing that and this was a you know

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,440
over a year ago that we start on this

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,560
project so so we start with Drupal 8 you

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,230
know worked on on migrating our Drupal 7

00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,450
content over to eight like I mentioned

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,580
you know invested state invested in

00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:05,450
lifts so you know we added lift and

00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,680
content hub got that going on the site

00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,000
and then we came up with you know we

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,220
talked about scoring and things like

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,710
that you know we came with some custom

00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,750
modules to basically go through and and

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,910
based again blathering back to KPI so

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:21,000
one of our one of our new KPIs was going

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:23,340
to be partner outbound links so again

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,660
being inspirational assuming that the

00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,430
the traveler is gonna move on to

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,020
somewhere else we're fine if they go out

00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,880
to Dollywood site to us that we've

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,800
succeeded like they're showing an intent

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,280
to do something right

00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,800
so we specifically score those fields on

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,400
the content that we feel would they like

00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,020
a website address newsletter sign up

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,570
inspirational banner images so we set

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,570
the system to basically every time the

00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,940
content is saved give it a score

00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,590
excuse me and then we filter you know we

00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,430
added a system also to add a trending

00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:58,350
aspect to that to where we also allow

00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,350
consumer views over time plus the score

00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:03,720
to kind of feed the site and actually

00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:07,140
lift the content up so that was a big

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,540
part of it and then we also so as far as

00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,520
like personalization goes you know we

00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,890
really landed on on three main areas

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,630
where the user is going where the

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:19,260
traveler is going what the travelers

00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:21,660
interested in and then we used lyft

00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:25,710
actually to move users through our CRM

00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,730
and channel funnel which I thought at

00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,550
the end of the day it was kind of a cool

00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,960
idea so so destination being I think you

00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,780
mentioned this earlier if somebody's

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,060
browsing from st. Louis we can tell that

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,340
with lyft and we show them content from

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,980
Memphis until they tell us otherwise so

00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:43,080
we do allow an explicit choice by the

00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,330
user to eventually override what we're

00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,920
guessing about them same with

00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,810
experiences if they're looking at a lot

00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,880
of outdoor content then we start

00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:53,580
featuring outdoor articles and the site

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,600
adjusts in that way and the way the CRM

00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,770
funnel works and there's there's

00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,340
probably other ways we could have done

00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,930
this but Lifta made it super easy is we

00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,600
just created you know different content

00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:06,150
pods for email signup printed guide

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,359
requests for the Pandora Channel for the

00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:11,160
snapchat Channel and set up events and

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,960
lyft and basically as the user you know

00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,609
if they've if they've already given us

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,080
their email address we don't need to

00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:18,210
keep asking for their email address so

00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,950
now we're like do you want to go see

00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,109
snapchat you know do you want to sign up

00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,850
on snapchat or whatever or Pandora or

00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,190
whatever so we keep guiding them in

00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:29,280
different places in the site to those

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:31,830
different channels very nice so let's

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,330
sum let's look at some of the results

00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:37,230
Bryan let's start with you we think

00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:40,380
about how you measure success that'll

00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:42,180
come in a moment but are there key

00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,700
results and metrics that you look at

00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,680
whether KPI driven as we

00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,329
or feedback from partners what have you

00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,329
what have you seen as a result so far

00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,440
well I mean feedback from partners is

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,560
important looking at you know site

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,240
visits time on site which which has

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,250
increased I mean that's that's been a

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,619
big increase the the level of engagement

00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,510
and time on our site and then those

00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:07,650
partner out bounds like Todd just

00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,349
mentioned you know we're holding

00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,570
ourselves accountable to try to steer

00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:14,099
you know push people out because yeah we

00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,690
want to inspire them and then we want

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,700
them to go buy a ticket to earn

00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:20,070
attraction or at least go peruse the web

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:24,690
site of an attraction and get into that

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:26,849
planning phase of the trip so some of

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,619
its related to campaign I mean since

00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:32,970
then we've invested in some other

00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:36,030
research tools like Adaro where we can

00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:38,790
we we put pixels on on every page on the

00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:40,710
site so we can see you know when that

00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,810
actually converts all the way through to

00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,940
booking an airplane ticket or booking a

00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:48,720
hotel and follow that through and that

00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,609
gives us insights on timing so you know

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,339
when is the right time to feature fall

00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:55,230
content you know it's well it depends on

00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:57,210
the demographic to some extent but the

00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,010
average booking window for fall content

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,440
you know we learn that's you know 65

00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,970
days out from when they booked that's

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,740
when we need to start featuring some of

00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,119
those articles and some of that content

00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:09,780
so it's like these guys said it's like a

00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,849
it's an ongoing learning process that

00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,890
drives the content decisions that we're

00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:15,569
making I mean a lot of the last year

00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,910
honestly has been putting those building

00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:20,520
blocks and in place with our partners

00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:22,589
and just making sure that we're well

00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,470
represented in each of those experience

00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:28,410
categories from outdoor to culinary to

00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:31,440
music to history and cover all those

00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:35,550
kind of bases and then we start with the

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,940
articles are our opportunity to really

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,800
feature things based on the collection

00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,500
of the data from site behavior but then

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,750
also how it funnels through using some

00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,339
of those other research products you

00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,960
mentioned when the events calendar was

00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:51,119
taken out traffic dropped dramatically

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,650
but you'd shared also there were things

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,500
sort of outside of your control that

00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,910
also affect your success I think worth

00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,390
sharing with everybody some of those

00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:01,030
things

00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,940
and what did you do about that well it's

00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:06,730
it's a constant battle so you know what

00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,920
Joe's referring to one of our planning

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:11,140
conversations is right around the time

00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,350
we launched and made this big investment

00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:18,250
of not only you know financial but time

00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:20,020
going into this thing Google also

00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,030
started to make some changes and that

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,410
they're curating tourism pages and

00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,420
travel pages and they're using

00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:28,660
algorithms to anticipate what the most

00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:31,720
popular destinations for travel will be

00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,700
and you know that's you know our site

00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,050
traffic like drop like you expected to

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,610
drop a little bit and then come back

00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,960
like it went through the floor and we

00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:41,560
just you know launched this new website

00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,540
so part of that was really getting more

00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,950
engagement from the SEO team to like

00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,350
okay what happened and we talked about

00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:52,510
the event calendar we're also now the

00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:54,250
team in charge of kind of managing our

00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:56,020
content creators and travel writers who

00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,670
we sent out into the field to get video

00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,970
and photo and write articles for the

00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,430
site like our itineraries are actually

00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:06,640
reviewed by the SEO team and we have

00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:09,010
held workshops with our content creators

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,860
and set up guidelines so that they're

00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,870
actually writing for optimal SEO

00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:18,040
performance on the site and the Nets

00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:20,440
coming in we review the articles both

00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,500
internally using those guidelines and

00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,180
when needed from the VML SEO team and

00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,860
then uploading it to the site and

00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,180
tagging it appropriately like really

00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,220
getting to those building blocks and

00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,020
that has helped us gain a lot of ground

00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,270
back towards getting our site traffic

00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,770
back up but you know the Google thing is

00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,140
frustrating because as an industry

00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:40,450
tourism is you know spent I'm sure

00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,700
billions of dollars you know on the

00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,470
platform and like we're just the search

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,450
engine well apparently you're the search

00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,920
destination now too but that's kind of

00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:51,850
our job right like we want to help

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,830
people discover places that they might

00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:56,710
not know about that's not gonna get fed

00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,880
by a popularity algorithm you know

00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,560
that's what we want to do we want to

00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,880
bring them in and then as they

00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,870
demonstrate interest help them discover

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,270
places within our state that I never

00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:10,120
have and you know that's just how it

00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,470
goes and so what about with the vml team

00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,570
when you think about measure

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,970
success for you there's many different

00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:18,160
constituents here at plays for you as a

00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,900
your client and they're in customers

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:27,190
Todd and Chris how did you measure

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:29,109
success in this well this is me so so I

00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:32,830
mean we did have several site metrics

00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:34,660
where we did see you know very very big

00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:36,369
improvements and in the areas that we

00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,830
were hoping to see big improvement so

00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:40,119
you know organic search again you know

00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,910
we've been suffering because of Google

00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,580
and and SEO issues but the visitors

00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:46,930
actually coming to our site I mean I

00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,690
think it was like the month after it was

00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:52,150
like we got a 30% or something session

00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:54,099
duration increase like 10% more time on

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,660
page I think the I forget all the

00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:57,430
numbers but you know again those partner

00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,440
out bounds year-over-year I think have

00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:03,640
gone up five or six percent now which is

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,650
important to us so I mean really I think

00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,130
that's the validation that we were

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:10,780
looking for again not trying not

00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:13,000
pretending that that there weren't

00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,089
issues that we needed to solve and you

00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,619
know we just you know pivoted very

00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,780
quickly as quickly as we could to try to

00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:22,540
solve those and you know with the site

00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,890
traffic down to just a side note you

00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,230
know there are some other things we did

00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:28,570
post launch because there are other

00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:32,109
channels again that people are consuming

00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:34,180
content on it's not I mean web you know

00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:36,760
web is still big but but you know

00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:39,250
there's all these other things so again

00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,580
speaking to how easy it is to extend

00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:44,500
Drupal or yeah Drupal you know very

00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,260
shortly after launch we started we

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,300
implemented Facebook instant articles

00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:52,420
and so that helped with you know getting

00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:54,190
our voice out on those channels and then

00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,550
also after that it was a little more

00:45:54,190 --> 00:46:00,130
difficult but Google amp articles in and

00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:02,530
you know there's also it's difficult

00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,940
also to to kind of marry those analytics

00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,240
together like do you call that a page

00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,510
view if it's on Google service so that's

00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,619
something we've also been monitoring

00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,480
well I think the other thing to that is

00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:15,430
is that by looking at the metrics we

00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,430
also ask ourselves okay from a human

00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:20,830
standpoint did we do we move the ball

00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:22,920
forward and we knew that we did we were

00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,770
seeing what we hope to see which was

00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,350
people browsing

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:29,120
people going oh okay we like you know

00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:31,790
the st. Louis example to see somebody

00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:35,780
jump from Memphis to Knoxville content

00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:37,430
that was more food based like paid off

00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,810
our hypothesis so that was very

00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:41,750
satisfying to be able to look at it and

00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:43,880
go we solved a real human problem and it

00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,800
also had the benefit of being able to

00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,540
move the business needles in the right

00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,610
direction obviously the challenges not

00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,290
withstanding but that was really

00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:53,900
exciting to see those numbers come in

00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,670
and to see that real human impact that

00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,860
at the end of the day is gonna result in

00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:59,390
somebody coming to a Nashville or

00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,060
somebody coming to a Bristol or a

00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:03,980
Memphis having a great time telling

00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,360
their friends and then bringing more

00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,850
people with them the next time and

00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,710
that's why I really liked is this was an

00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:12,020
exciting brand to be able to work with

00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,460
and to work on because you see you can

00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,830
walk around and see the tangible

00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,080
tangible results well and I just want to

00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:21,170
add that it it brought the website in

00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,580
line with the brand you know we're

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,410
making these big investments in

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,900
advertising we're bringing them to a

00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,520
place that reflects what that initial

00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,240
experience was when they were viewing

00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,400
our video or seeing a digital ad it

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,040
continues that on instead of like oh

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,180
this this this doesn't really line up

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,250
with what I just saw

00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,260
you know so - for me that's a that's a

00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:46,490
big win awesome

00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:47,960
so crawl walk run and setting

00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,510
expectations as you look at the future

00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,270
and you think about where do you go from

00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:56,300
here what do you tackle next Brian is

00:47:53,270 --> 00:48:00,010
what's next in store for tourism

00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:03,200
Tennessee well as far as the site goes

00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:07,700
we have since launched a new industry

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,920
page that that is also on Drupal and

00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:13,280
utilizes brand we're almost done with a

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,760
new press site and it's a continuation

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,070
of this i adding the content I think

00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,200
we're gonna take a deeper dive into the

00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:23,330
personalization and see how we can can

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,700
utilize that even more based on what

00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,890
we've learned over the past year and

00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,730
then you know our campaigns we just

00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:34,230
continue to try to be creative and stand

00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:35,520
apart so we drive people here

00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,490
if you haven't or you have the

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,770
opportunity check out our colorblind

00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:44,160
colorblind list viewer video that you

00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,990
can find out through our website does a

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,770
neat project that we started last fall

00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:52,050
and will continue on in doing exciting

00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:55,470
you know exclusive concert activations

00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,440
to create inbound marketing as opposed

00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:00,240
to you know trying to just keep pumping

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,619
dollars into the search engines I think

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,850
that video is what we have on slide one

00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,780
if I have time I'll go back to it and

00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,940
play it I think that's what's there

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,410
anything Chris Todd you to add in terms

00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,410
of the future as you think about what's

00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,640
next and helping Brian in that mission

00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,260
well for me it's the excitement of being

00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,900
able to take the personalization to the

00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,640
next level right we have the competency

00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,710
now where we know that we're doing it

00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:23,010
well okay how do we take it to the next

00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:25,500
level how do we go deeper into the the

00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:28,170
creative for the campaigns and more

00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,520
tightly integrate those so that that

00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,530
emotional impact if you haven't seen

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,500
that video if you know you'll tear up

00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:36,450
it's it's a beautiful video for me the

00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,400
next challenge from kind of tying the

00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:40,710
brand tighter together is how do we

00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,320
start to pay some of that off via some

00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,590
of those things how do we go in to some

00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,609
of the ideas around what showing b-roll

00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:49,290
from some of those interviews that we

00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,960
did with some folks and kind of trying

00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:53,760
to pull a little bit of that forward but

00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,170
certainly the personalization and and

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,150
really going to the next level in

00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:59,010
knowing going into it knowing that we're

00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:01,200
going to be successful when we tackle

00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:04,560
that next step you touch that video

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,900
video we need more video hey video is

00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,350
content man it's love it that's what

00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,859
they tell me

00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:12,180
yeah I mean just continuing to put great

00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:13,560
content onto the site I think we've

00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,900
always had a little bit of a challenge

00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,550
kind of marrying up our campaigns with

00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,530
our site I think there's room for

00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:22,080
improvement there because I mean again

00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:24,090
the creative team at BML just produces

00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:27,750
this amazing work and it's always

00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:29,130
represented to some degree but you know

00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,330
sometimes I think we could improve in

00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,190
that area

00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,690
personalization I mean of course I would

00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,720
love to expand on that what I'd really

00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:39,750
like to do is probably set up a schedule

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,240
of a/b testing and see how that goes and

00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,910
start seeing like if we can improve the

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,230
site in that way I mean that's the part

00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,820
of the key areas for being I mean we're

00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,380
really improving that the

00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,930
partner communication stuff is really

00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,640
improved there may be still some tweaks

00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,340
that could be done with that but I mean

00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,630
that whole program with with getting

00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,380
them to improve their content I think

00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:01,830
has has worked out really well so great

00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,300
very good

00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:05,220
all right well that brings us to the end

00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,330
of what we wanted to share we'll we'll

00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,860
see if we have any questions from the

00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:11,280
audience we have a mic I think should be

00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:18,540
on if anyone wants to come on ask us a

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:19,620
tough one any takers I'm gonna try if

00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,370
I've got any questions I'm gonna see if

00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:27,270
I go back

00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:31,200
Jared's got one the actual process of

00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:34,020
the development process and do you

00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,720
employ agile technology did you have

00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,610
prints and what was your Akkadian sand

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,940
and then after you went live have you

00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:45,420
continued that concept of continuous

00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:48,270
argument yeah well I mean I will say it

00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:51,450
was a little agile waterfall so for the

00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:53,310
initial launch we do work in two-week

00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:55,920
sprints so you know we go through kind

00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:58,710
of the normal ceremonies we have we work

00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,590
out of JIRA we estimate everything point

00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,200
everything have a daily scrum and then

00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:07,140
we'd work in two-week release cycles so

00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:10,680
now having said that the initial site

00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:13,110
redesign didn't launch four months right

00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,590
so it took that long until Brian and

00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:18,240
every product owner was happy with what

00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,740
had been released and this is this is

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,810
something we can actually put out in the

00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,610
world but now we do have we're still

00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:27,090
working in the dev team is sitting

00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:28,620
behind you actually we still work in

00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:31,080
two-week sprints and so now we do have

00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:34,230
much more regular releases now I think

00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,730
every sprint at this point of features

00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,320
and stuff and and yeah I mean it's just

00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,370
a continue it was you know and that's

00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,160
that's something that we've struggled

00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:42,270
with the vml in the past is you know

00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,040
somebody comes to us and they want a big

00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,950
website project and they do it and then

00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:50,100
they disappear and this this has been

00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:51,780
just an amazing opportunity to you know

00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:55,110
release a product and continue to

00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,460
iterate over it and improve it so so

00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:58,890
hopefully we don't have to do another

00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,390
big release someday in the future and we

00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,890
could just you know keep on top of it

00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:04,350
well it shows the power

00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:07,440
going from a project type relationship

00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:09,420
to a true relationship that we were able

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,890
to pivot right when we ran into some of

00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,230
those challenges with the calendar we

00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,150
pivoted didn't you know and Brian didn't

00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:18,600
have to go down and track down another

00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:21,180
design and dev group to fix that he had

00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,700
his team hey guys we need to pivot on

00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,650
this and great and now and then that

00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,990
really I think was got us into the cycle

00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:29,160
of the incremental point releases and

00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,470
got us how I've kind of that mode of

00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,660
like the big reveal which I hate the big

00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:36,030
reveals sometimes you need to do that

00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,700
even within you know what's that MVP can

00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:40,380
be sizeable but it's making sure that

00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,120
you shift gears within the context of

00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,450
having a good product owner like Brian

00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,070
and having the ongoing relationship to

00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,330
be able to make those pivots and I think

00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:50,490
that's what continues to keep the

00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,960
relationship strong yeah and I think you

00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,490
have to have that relationship to be

00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,260
able to do that because I've also worked

00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:58,890
on projects where we're just like the IT

00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,690
shop and that's okay but it will never

00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,790
run it's you can't you can't move as

00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:05,160
agile as we have with with this product

00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:06,780
project and and you know pivot when we

00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,240
need to so they didn't tell me it was

00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,680
never gonna end I said I said today it

00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,930
will never end

00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,930
it's a dirty Brian it's a journey

00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:21,210
TG has a question so it seems like a

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,250
major strength this project was pairing

00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:25,560
the right technology with the right

00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:27,660
approach and really kind of setting a

00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,790
precedent early on for putting the time

00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,340
energy and workshopping in to make sure

00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:34,920
that you had data and content that would

00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,930
really put the technology to work and

00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,580
the way that was supposed to if you were

00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,590
working with a new client who is maybe a

00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,770
little more hesitant to put the legwork

00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:45,030
and at the initial stages of the project

00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:46,890
what would your kind of recommendation

00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:52,920
be to get them on board to really do it

00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:55,200
right from the start I think it's going

00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,940
and sitting with them and it's sitting

00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,610
down and being able to run even if it's

00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,840
a mini workshop to be able to come in

00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:03,330
and go okay let's really truly

00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:05,580
understand what is your part what do you

00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:07,260
feel your problem is here's the data

00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,450
that we'll a lot of times coming in and

00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,800
we'll grab data even if it's a client

00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:13,170
that we can't get into their analytics

00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,150
yet we'll make some educated guesses so

00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,810
we'll go in with a baseline and then

00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,270
we'll really have

00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:20,610
the conversation with them of okay who

00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,050
is your true consumptive audience not

00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,850
your aspirational audience but the

00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,280
consumptive audience it's coming to your

00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:27,510
digital experience and then from there

00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,760
we go okay well we know those people

00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:32,970
tend to want to do these kind of things

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,470
how well do we execute that so we always

00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:36,990
start with the audience and we really

00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:39,900
try to bring in the the human truth of

00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:41,940
that audience and then almost use that

00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:45,210
as a mirror to hold up to the business

00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:47,700
into the brand and go okay great where

00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:49,950
do we want to pivot towards so a lot of

00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,140
times it's about problem definition and

00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,610
until you get to that yeah you can go

00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,380
and you can build things and you can

00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,260
launch things but you don't really know

00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,760
if you had the the human impact and

00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:03,840
importantly within that workshop is to

00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:06,930
what are the real explicit KPIs what are

00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:10,320
the behaviors that we can watch we can

00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:13,980
measure we can adjust right what are the

00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,840
I heard a saying once you know you only

00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,430
get three key performance indicators

00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,320
because if you have more than three that

00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,960
starts to become all the performance

00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,670
indicators and then they're not key so

00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,770
we really hone in on those two things to

00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:27,900
get the buy-in and then from there it's

00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:30,540
really helping educate and get the

00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,340
clients sold on the process of getting

00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,800
incremental point releases into the

00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:37,260
marketplace and sometimes that is a

00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,550
discussion around waterfall of you know

00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,320
you start out with a great budget and

00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:43,230
they get to the end he need to pivot and

00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,960
you have no budget as opposed to a more

00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:49,050
scrum fashion of let's get some of that

00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,610
return and going very quickly that way

00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:53,070
if we do need a pivot you've got the

00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:56,220
budget so it's kind of evangelist it's

00:56:53,070 --> 00:57:03,300
educator it's facilitator and starting

00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:11,150
there any other questions let's see if

00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:11,150
we can get this video this is it

00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,540
right let's try that it came

00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:44,220
[Music]

00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:46,109
everybody at work was saying how pretty

00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,490
the colors are you don't know that

00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:51,510
you're missing it because you never saw

00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:55,170
it to begin with I remember being in

00:57:51,510 --> 00:58:00,569
like kindergarten and like having to

00:57:55,170 --> 00:58:04,410
read the labels on the crayons I took a

00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:06,390
test there were 50 pages normally if
