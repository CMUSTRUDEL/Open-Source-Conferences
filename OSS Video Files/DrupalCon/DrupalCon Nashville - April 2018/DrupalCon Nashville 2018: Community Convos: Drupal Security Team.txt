hello everybody hi

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,669
welcome this is the community discussion

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,100
on the security team security team was a

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,020
little busy about two weeks ago if you

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,600
haven't updated your site yet you should

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:46,399
leave this room right now and go and do

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:51,870
that everybody good

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,670
okay that's great news so honestly I was

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,710
gonna make nice pretty slides for this

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,030
and then this thing happened and I

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,410
didn't make nice pre slides and I was

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,359
told I didn't have to have nice pretty

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,170
slides but I have really good

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,270
documentation on drupal.org I go over

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,220
this so the agenda today is we're gonna

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,380
talk a little about what we do how we do

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,250
it where we work and then we're gonna

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,030
have a lot of time for questions I'm

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,110
sorry oh if they're talking to each

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,610
other then I don't need to listen

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,470
awesome so the drupal security team is a

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,930
team of all volunteers

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,430
I say volunteers because they volunteer

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,130
to be on the security team but a lot of

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,140
them their companies pay them to cover

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,119
their time working on security issues so

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,770
they are volunteers from the security

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,450
team perspective but in most cases their

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,299
companies are on board and supportive of

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,549
them doing this work we cover all of

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,960
Drupal core I think people are familiar

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,700
with that product and most of the

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,759
contributing a contributed module that

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:58,350
has the covered by advisory tab on it

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:06,090
pulling up a random page now let's see

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:08,689
how so if it's got the shield sorry I've

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,689
got the pointer

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,450
yes let me pull out my physical shield

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,880
the pointers not gonna help the

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,550
recording either ok I'm gonna skip on

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,530
the report on the pointer for now so I

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,530
think everybody can see the shield

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,550
projects that have a shield are

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,640
maintained and covered by the security

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,470
team in theory theory if there's a

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,870
security issue in these modules they

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,550
reported the security team first we will

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,260
work with the maintainer x' to solve the

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,030
issues so typically what will happen as

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,980
a security researcher sometimes the

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,440
maintainer x' themselves sometimes

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,570
people who aren't security researchers

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,580
but just people in the community find a

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,160
security issue maybe it's in views maybe

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,390
it's in core and they report it to the

00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,920
security team and then there's some

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,620
vetting that goes on is this a valid

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,209
issue is this a you know an actual

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,440
security vulnerability sometimes it's

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,330
more along the lines of a security

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,970
hardening sometimes it's just site

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,010
configuration issue you know I can I can

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,200
write full HTML when I'm logged in or

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,820
when I'm authentic ated as a basic user

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,430
well you can do that because you check

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,980
the check box for the input filter not

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,140
because there's a security vulnerability

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,700
we then will vet it we then talk to the

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,970
maintainer of the code if it's Drupal

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,590
code we will reach out to the core

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,170
maintainer x' and we will work with them

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,100
on finding out what the issue is

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,410
figuring out what the patch for the

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,080
issue is and eventually on a Wednesday

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,110
releasing the information out into the

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:46,970
wild we do this by publishing security

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:51,769
advisories it's great live demos so our

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:56,900
output is mostly this page here where we

00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:58,730
have a security advisories most of these

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,560
are all very formulaic we have a

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,560
different page for contributed projects

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,110
and they pretty much all give you some

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,110
basic information

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,910
one of the risk we're actually gonna be

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,010
spending some time working on redoing

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,739
the risk calculations at some point in

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,889
the near future

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:24,360
of the problem and the module itself

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,360
apparently my last pass is having issues

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:35,470
which is almost always upgrade to the

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,000
new the latest module our issues are

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,190
security advisories that are actually

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,350
now getting full issue credit so if you

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,669
report an issue to us you will receive

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,550
issue credit through the normal issue

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,410
credit systems for your security work as

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,910
well which is helpful to people on the

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:54,540
team as well as people reporting things

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:56,979
to us any questions before I continue

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,810
okay I'll have quite time for questions

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:01,389
at the end but I like to parse things up

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,100
so what happens if you find a security

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,900
issue how would you go about reporting a

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,180
security issue you think you found

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,860
something you're not quite sure the

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,330
easiest thing to do is when you're on up

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,360
on a project page there will be a button

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:19,060
labeled report a security vulnerability

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,560
and if you click that button you'll

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,419
either be routed at one out of two

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,979
places you'll either be routed to the

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:26,500
private issue tracker which I'm not

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,360
going to click on this because this is

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,300
being recorded and might show things

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,060
it's not supposed to show or you'll be

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,039
routed to the public issue queue and it

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,930
will fill it a tag of security issue for

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,550
you if your round with the public issue

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,470
queue it means that the maintainer has

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,570
not opted in to security coverage for

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,389
their project and so the vulnerabilities

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,650
get disclosed publicly if you get routed

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:52,090
to the private security yes you you

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,160
could open this page in it in an

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,930
anonymous browser window and then it

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,120
would be safe to click on it I think if

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:03,490
I do that it's gonna prompt me to login

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,570
I don't have a I don't have a demo

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:13,300
account to login as just sorry video

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:15,130
people okay so this actually is not a

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,450
problem to disclose so when you click on

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,180
this and you're out into the private

00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,240
issue tracker you're gonna see something

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,229
that looks a little bit similar to this

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,740
you're not going to see the follow up

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,440
date field

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,330
that's an internal mechanism you got the

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,680
issue metadata you're not gonna see some

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,139
of these fields we hide some of these

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,490
fields from you and then at the bottom

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,840
you get a text box to fill in with the

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,880
issues this is just like the public

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,370
issue queue tell us what the problem is

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,110
give us the steps to reproduce we fill

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,690
in some text for you and then you just

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,099
submit the issue like any other issue if

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,449
you're routed into the public queue it

00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:55,599
is the public issue queue and they all

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:57,819
look very similar yes today okay so

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,440
that's reporting an issue to us we like

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,599
it when people report issues to us if

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,569
you're ever on the fence like it might

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,250
be a security issue but quite sure go

00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,889
ahead and report it to us anyhow well

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,810
we'll let you know not only if it is or

00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,690
if it's not but also how we came to that

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,310
reasoning so there's a little bit of an

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,289
education process going on there if you

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,539
think you found like you know a really

00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:26,380
big major security issue then definitely

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:28,930
report it to us we have a lot of

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,219
policies and protocols to find I'm not

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,719
going to read through everything on this

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,729
page but one of the things that I do

00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:37,780
want to talk about is how you might join

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:39,460
the security team there is a formal

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,530
application process for joining the

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,530
security team it's outlined here

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,420
we're making all the security team

00:07:50,980 --> 00:08:02,290
members set up here as those who decided

00:07:52,420 --> 00:08:05,020
to come come join us here welcome so

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,640
joining the security team the process to

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,440
join the security team is pretty easy

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,000
it's an email there are some

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,320
requirements that we like to have you

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,570
have met first and there's somewhat

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,370
outlined in this document and so you can

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,830
read through what those requirements are

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,360
if you meet like 90% of them and are

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,360
missing one go ahead and apply anyhow

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,169
why would you want to join the security

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:38,380
team because we're a group of really

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:40,330
cool people you get a free hat we asked

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,479
for hours of your labor and in exchange

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,980
all you get is a lousy $10 hat it's

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,590
actually really rewarding when I join

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,830
the security team there was a bit of

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,880
impostor syndrome going on working with

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,160
some of the people who I was working

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,400
with and you know the team and this is

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,290
the people who are currently on the team

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,600
the team is just a great wonderful group

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,940
of people who really care about security

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,770
and you know unfortunately this team

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,230
does a lot of the work it does in

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,390
private unlike everything else in the

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,000
open source world pretty much what we do

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,400
happens behind a closed website that is

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,270
for obvious reasons hopefully hard to

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:22,120
gain access to so different perspectives

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,590
are really helpful because you know not

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,240
all of us are site builders in fact if

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,290
you go through this list and ask most of

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,610
these people were the last time they

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:32,350
built a site I see people squinting most

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,290
the time when they built like last built

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,940
a site most these people don't build

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,780
multiple sites for the most part with

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,640
you know some exceptions do build sites

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,899
not anymore okay

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,649
you're probably most recent you build

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:56,800
sites I do okay so and I build sites but

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:56,800
that has a site-to-site to his personal

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:07,610
so scary team is a great is a fun group

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,260
of people to work with and so that's why

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,630
you might want to join the security team

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:16,190
the other things that we'll talk briefly

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,630
about is you know what is this page for

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,430
people who are new to Drupal when we

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,980
look at you know the number of

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,890
advisories that we release let's skip

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:37,899
2018 let's go back to 2017 for a second

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:45,200
in 2017 we released 97 items we released

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:47,800
97 issues in 2017 sorry I'm sorry and

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,880
that doesn't include the core issues in

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,410
2017 for core issues we released this is

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,560
where slides are helpful

00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,050
we released four issues so you might

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,970
look at this and be like is Drupal

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,010
really secure that that's like over a

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,440
hundred things you guys published about

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:12,170
in a year like is that a good thing

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,649
really a good thing and the answer is

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,540
we're somewhat unique in this we we we

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,399
we go on the side of being cautious so

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,730
yeah we over publish issues every single

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,740
one of these is a is a known issue in

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,449
Drupal that we fix the problems behind

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,170
keep in mind that we are covering

00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:31,850
massive amounts of contribs some of them

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,649
are modules like views and see tools

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,149
some of them are modules that you've

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,540
never heard of because they're in use by

00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:40,519
a hundred people but if the maintainer

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,610
opts into the security team coverage we

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,779
will cover the the the code for them and

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,660
we will help them with the advisory

00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,660
process anybody else want to speak

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:59,770
they're not a loud group I would say so

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,870
two things on on why why you'd want to

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,300
join and sort of who like what skillsets

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,460
are useful to join as a security team

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,990
member sometimes you're like fixing

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,430
issues and sometimes you're helping just

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,440
find issues and coordinate the release

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,030
of issues so if you are very technically

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,980
savvy you might like the form of those

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,300
actually like getting into the code and

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,400
really understanding the vulnerability

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,220
and helping the maintainer or working on

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,750
core actually fix the problem and other

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,580
times you might just want to help the

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,980
process along and so you don't have to

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,140
be like very deep in the internals of

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,240
Drupal to to help the security team or

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,850
be a member of the security team so all

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,440
different types of skill sets are useful

00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,600
documentation writers people writing

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,240
code people managing process project

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,480
managers and the like is all useful the

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,040
second thing I would test your testers

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,740
absolutely absolutely customers are good

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,520
people the second point I want to say on

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,950
on why you should opt into security

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,780
advisory like support for your project

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,340
so it's an it's an opt-in process so as

00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,380
a maintainer you can choose for your

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,150
project to be covered by the security

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,760
team that's a good signal to send to

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,140
people that want to use your module so

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,210
if you or your theme or whatever your

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,040
project is if you opt into security

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,170
advisory status and coverage you're

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,760
telling people you know when you

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,410
download this project and use this

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,330
project and there's a security

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,880
vulnerability found in it the security

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,100
team will help ensure a safe process to

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,320
fix that vulnerability the security

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,520
improv cover uses a process that's

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,370
broadly known as a responsible

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,350
disclosure and so that's the process

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,780
that we follow now not all maintainer is

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,700
not all projects need security coverage

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,290
and so we recognize that you know the

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,440
original rule on this is if you had a

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,060
stable version we would cover you and so

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,040
as soon as the maintainer cut a stable

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,780
version sometimes without realizing that

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,520
cutting a stable version actually opted

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,900
them in to security team coverage we

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,210
would start covering them and so you'd

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,950
end up with projects I think bad

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,290
judgment for a while had security team

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,180
coverage like we ended up with projects

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,920
that you know intentionally like really

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:02,290
should not have security team coverage

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,240
so we added a functionality in here for

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,160
opting in so as a maintainer you have to

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,670
explicitly opt-in to being covered by

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,410
the security team on new projects and so

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,110
that does a bunch of signaling on the

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,720
project page it also does signaling on

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,519
the report a security vulnerability

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,949
button where that actually takes you is

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,170
affected by that and then we still

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:24,910
require the the stable release we're not

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,800
going to cover an alpha release of code

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:30,279
and even if you've opted in and so if

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,750
you look on project pages some of that

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,750
signaling is there you can see that

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:41,589
Drupal 6 is no longer supported either

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,240
by the community at large or by the

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,860
security team having said that there are

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,709
some vendors who are providing support

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,360
for it but the security team itself will

00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:53,769
not provide coverage for Drupal 6

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,920
because well how long ago two years ago

00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:59,769
it's a while ago

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,750
any questions let's open this up it's 15

00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,190
minutes left let's take questions can

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,480
you come up to the microphone because

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,490
I'm being told by people that that's

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,220
important thing I can I'm just sorry

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,579
about that I'm just curious when we do

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,290
code reviews in house it would help if

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,569
there were examples of the types of

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,639
security issues that you guys find so we

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:20,440
could train some of our developers on

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,730
here's what not to do or here's what has

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,860
been done in the past that you shouldn't

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,510
do anymore is that something that the

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,920
signal somebody or the security team

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,279
might be able to provide just examples

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,529
of mistakes or there's handbook pages on

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,810
how to write secure code what I tell the

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,480
students that I have I've worked my day

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,490
job as the University of Michigan what I

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,079
tell the students is they should

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,410
actually go and look at the

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:46,089
vulnerabilities and questions so here is

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:49,630
EXIF module we can see that this was

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:52,420
fixed in 1.1 so go look at the code diff

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,819
between 1.1 and 1.0 and it will show you

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,160
exactly what was changed for security

00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:58,600
releases especially in core slightly

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,579
less so in contraire

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,230
we're pretty good at saying you know in

00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,579
your security release we really only

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,920
want you fixing the security

00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,930
vulnerability sometimes maintainer sneak

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,060
you know a couple other little bug fixes

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,100
in there but for the most part security

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,290
fixes fix just the security

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,800
vulnerability so if we if we do this

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,090
together

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,000
this is EXI

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:23,620
so we can go and take a look and we can

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,370
say brow brow SCO's are positive and we

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:34,900
want 1.1 and let's see if it'll generate

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:37,510
the diff and I can't read that quick

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,940
enough to figure out what it's doing but

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,300
it's doing things you'd have to go back

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,130
and read the what the vulnerability here

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,960
is and then you could figure out what's

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,500
what's actually going on but that's

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,670
pretty easy to do with a lot of modules

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,960
cross-site scripting issues are probably

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,040
the most common in Drupal cross-site

00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,800
scripting issues are probably the most

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,410
common in Drupal just not escaping

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,810
Drupal filters on output and so just not

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,340
escaping output and allowing code to get

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,690
into it's more Drupal 7 than Drupal 8

00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,000
triple Eight's done a lot to fix that

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:18,940
issue but most Drupal 7 issues by far

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,590
were cross-site scripting - there so

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,720
what so one example is definitely to

00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,490
look at the security advisories do the

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,290
diff of the code and and understandable

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,350
mobility there there's no library of

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,910
like bad code I think I'd be an amazing

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,920
thing to have for our project if anybody

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,350
wants to develop that these snippets or

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,970
big bitter things that be useful for so

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,080
many things

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,630
individual developer training or even

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,850
like automating different static

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,840
analysis tools or the like so library

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,520
would be amazing what we have right now

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,860
is the security advisories and doing the

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,960
diff there are some projects out there

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:54,250
that are intentionally vulnerable that

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,390
are available for training or for mostly

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,630
that's just for training so there

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,830
there's a project and I'm not sure where

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,370
these resources that it was called

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:06,460
designs II there was like some launches

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:09,430
yeah it might be linked from the how to

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,990
how to write secure code we have to find

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,120
something we will update on the issue

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:17,730
node for this session with last of those

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,730
resources its it is all

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:26,510
in non Drupal space there's like

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:28,940
Metasploit a bull web goat a number of

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,740
other sort of tools used for training

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,060
and testing I think it'd be a great

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,130
initiative to have something like this

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,870
for Drupal if if people are interested

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,410
in working on this and can dedicate

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,880
resources to it please see me afterwards

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,870
my email I'll put my email information

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,870
up here in a second

00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:01,190
slide anybody else yes so what's their

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,900
process for doing the work that you do

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,520
do you have regular meetings do you have

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,510
an open slack that you're always

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,530
watching and how much time to each of

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,540
you put into this every month so the our

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,950
our tool set revolves around a Drupal

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,280
site known as security that drupal.org

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:22,280
there is a slack channel there are

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,470
regular ish meetings and the time range

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,060
really varies by member there are some

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,290
members who put in quite a lot of time

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:32,450
and there are some who put in less time

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:35,210
and so it you know I think it averages

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:38,180
it averages probably about 10 ish hours

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,300
10 to 15 hours a month barring something

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,800
not happening like oh - which was you

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,070
know a lot more time from a lot more

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,560
people because it was fairly large

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,720
endeavor to go through and do that work

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,640
and so I just wanted to point out that

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,960
like I got looped in for a very very

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,900
small thing which is writing the

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,520
advisory but I saw how much effort and

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,140
time was going into that one meeting and

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,550
how everyone was spending hours just

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,260
getting that one advisory out and I

00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,760
think a lot of us might just take it for

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,130
granted like others advisory I have to

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,660
update my module but like wow the amount

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,370
of work that went out behind the scenes

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,900
and not everyone gets to see that so

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:17,480
that was really incredible for me and I

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:19,580
wanted to get that on recording just to

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,580
follow up on the process question about

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,620
what the what the security team does

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,630
there it's a lot of the work is triaging

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,270
so there are reports that come in about

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:31,040
vulnerabilities and security members are

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,590
assigned a two-week time period to

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,230
handle triaging which basically means

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,630
validating is this a security issue that

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,360
we need a private security advisory

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,830
process to release a fish for um so

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,870
somebody might report a vulnerability

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,670
and a bit of code that's that doesn't

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,140
have us you know hasn't the project

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,760
maintainer hasn't marked it for the

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,530
security advisory process or security

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,790
team support so that would disqualify ed

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,440
or if it's a development release or

00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,000
there's other you know qualification so

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,800
or it's not a vulnerability or it's not

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,450
a vulnerability I'm misunderstanding or

00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,130
you know we also get bug reports and

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,730
reported to us privately their you know

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,860
the the triage aspect is so you know the

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,150
lifecycle of an issue is it give me one

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,300
second life cycle of an issue as it

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:13,100
comes in at least one person looks at it

00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,980
for triage if that one person thinks

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,180
that it's probably valid another person

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,110
probably looks at it again just to make

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,960
sure you know they didn't miss anything

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,060
and then it gets assigned to somebody

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,160
who kind of Shepherds it through the

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,850
rest of the process and so at that point

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,080
a patch is developed to fix the issue

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,580
that's typically the responsibility of

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,340
the maintainer to actually develop the

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,680
patch not the security team members now

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,040
in some instances the maintainer czar on

00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,050
the security team but for the most part

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,520
it's the maintainer job to work on the

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,500
patch a security team member will then

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,080
look at the patch look at the original

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,970
report and test it does this patch fix

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,590
the issue are there any other issues

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,910
that you know with a quick glance over

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,800
can we see that there's any other issues

00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,910
like this in the module so sometimes

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,670
you'll get reported across site

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,470
scripting on line 38 and the maintainer

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,690
will fix line 38 then you look at it in

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,220
line 42 seventy-five eighty seven all

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,710
have cross-site scripting issues on it

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,330
so we don't want to keep repeating

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,000
repeat issuing essay so we'll spend a

00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:13,160
quick time doing a it's an informal

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,290
review of the of the contributed code

00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,030
then we coordinate on a Wednesday so

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,040
we'll talk to the maintainer and we'll

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,410
say we need to time find a time for you

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,150
to release this on Wednesday they can

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,090
actually then commit the code up to 24

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,100
hours in advance they then tag a

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:31,430
security release and then on a Wednesday

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,590
a security team member will publish the

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:36,590
SA node the security advisory node like

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,290
this one and then publish the release

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,510
and then approve the automated emails to

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:44,270
go out and make sure the Twitter things

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,280
happen which then feeds all sorry then

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,510
which feeds all other subsystems at that

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,130
point

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:54,540
yeah so my question was a birds to

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:56,700
Drupal get in the sequel and I'm not

00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,520
trying to poke poke up or assault on

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,429
fresh wounds it was just about the PSA

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,490
did not mention a patch it said cor up

00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:07,320
core upgrade and wondering was that

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,390
intentional that you did not mention it

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,940
was just a patch would be available is

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:15,330
hearing because it also affects our my

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,650
our strategy for it so with that there

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,450
were a couple things that went into mind

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,220
when we issued the PSA we were not sure

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,870
we were gonna release a patch with it at

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,700
the time so we did not want to promise

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,700
something and then have to deliver on it

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:30,059
at the point in the future the security

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,400
teams advice is to always do full

00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:34,320
upgrades don't apply patches always do

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,910
the full upgrades because you end up

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,059
building more technical debt by just

00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:41,550
applying the patches so we ended up

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,660
releasing a patch which was you know not

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,400
the only one who wanted it there were a

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,520
lot there was a large demand for patches

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,290
and so will could probably continue you

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,240
know I'm not I'm not gonna commit myself

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,770
but you know four major critical issues

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,170
it's helpful to have a patch available

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:57,360
we see that but but on the flip side of

00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,890
it the the process you know putting the

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,630
processes in place when you initially

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,220
build sites to be able to do upgrades

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,580
and this goes back to Teresa's keynote

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,320
this morning on we need better you know

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,280
better tooling around security coverage

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:14,040
on upgrades upgrades are can be hard so

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,730
we you know we need to fix problems in

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,830
both directions Michael can you spend

00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,470
some time and explain us the process of

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:26,190
how to get a security shield on a

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:28,650
contrib module our company basically

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,120
built a couple of contrib modules and we

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,240
have been hitting roadblocks for almost

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:40,980
a year and I gave up even going through

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:42,750
that but probably for the audience no

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,290
it's it's the it's the project

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,730
application q is what this is so there's

00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,410
a lot of technical debt here's this

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,990
short answer and I'm sorry for the

00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,990
technical debt that you're seeing from

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:56,790
from our side of things the project

00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:59,850
application q which is the official

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,330
mechanism to get these god abandoned to

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,420
some

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,040
when we moved over to doing full letting

00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,020
everyone create full projects and so

00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,640
there was a whole review bonus system in

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,960
there and people could get through that

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,310
it was not efficient it took forever

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,380
which is one of the reasons why we did

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,090
this the problem is that since we did

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,740
that all of the resources behind that

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,830
problem project application queue have

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,680
gone away there have been talks now for

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:29,340
eight nine months of replacing that

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:30,900
entire process with a quiz a test

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,550
something along those lines so that you

00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,080
could you know we want to know do you

00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,520
know what drupal.org policies are and

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,260
can you quickly identify common security

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,260
issues that's that's what we want out of

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:43,500
the project application q and so that's

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,150
the longer term vision the shorter term

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,290
vision is for now just email the

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,850
security team and let's see if we can

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:53,850
get somebody to just go through and mark

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:55,530
your projects approved I to address the

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,110
difficulty of installing updates and

00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,250
also to address that crazy 40 click

00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,950
video from this morning a tree has

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,090
played a technical valuation what's the

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,190
likelihood of you guys setting up

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,660
repository standard Red Hat and Debian

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,970
repositories so somebody could just do a

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,880
simple llamar apt-get install and get

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,260
everything up and running and have

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,330
packages like I'm into updates deal with

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,890
the updates for us probably pretty slim

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,240
because most people aren't at least from

00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,940
our research most people aren't using

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,200
vendor packages to install if I'm

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,360
understanding your question correctly

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,770
they're not using vendor packages to

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,970
install Drupal because it doesn't

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,580
include any of the contributed modules

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:35,210
yeah are you wanting to like apt-get

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,210
install Drupal

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:46,060
because you want to utilize I why their

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,940
deployment schemes

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:52,300
I know Debian does this like there's a

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:55,270
debian package maintainer who repackaged

00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,620
who repackages most like not just Drupal

00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:23,550
but even some of the contribs pace I'm

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:23,550
pretty sure that that's happening Oh

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,750
commit to investigating that as a

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,790
concept Oh

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,830
I'll also add that doesn't need to be

00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,810
the security team that does this there's

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,420
a lot of there's a lot of community

00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:42,790
maintain packages the entire doc a repo

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:47,260
docker repos for Drupal are not

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:48,670
maintained by anyone we know it's just

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,320
it's an open source project and

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:56,050
somebody's just you know doing a pull

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,460
request against the docker file sorry I

00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:00,160
came in late so you may have already

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,920
answered this but one of the challenges

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,480
that I see is that we with especially

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,390
with with the change in the security

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,100
model that it's really difficult for for

00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,310
and with the number of people that are

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,050
using github repos to go off to

00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,760
distribute Drupal modules as well the

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,550
security model kind of breaks down for

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,610
Drupal because you can't really run a

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:23,350
website only with modules that are being

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,830
approved and we're being monitored by

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:30,160
the security team so how do we deal with

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:33,460
with both educating and prioritizing it

00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,970
so that that we can maybe even just

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,370
favor those modules that have have been

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,860
vetted for security or compare them or

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:45,490
provide more incentives for people to

00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:49,140
have taken the effort to to take the

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:51,120
extra steps to to self-select into

00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,190
having coverage by the security team

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,570
because we're like previously the

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,000
assumption was if you pull the module

00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,130
from drupal.org and there's a bug on the

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,320
module you're going to find out when

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,930
when that gets addressed right now you

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,580
may or may not find out if you know if

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,560
you're you know depending on where your

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,610
information is coming from and and so I

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,050
think I think we need to try and think

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,470
about this as a community to find better

00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:15,330
ways to communicate and to reinstate the

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,680
value of just having a basic security

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,270
model of putting out releases on a

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,120
regular basis which is it's really

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:22,620
falling down even with Drupal 7 let

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,540
alone Drupal 8 that people have not been

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,970
putting out full releases and it's it's

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,770
a it's a real challenge so too quiet so

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,150
two points one of the things in order to

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,980
address that we should address why

00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,500
people are doing it why are people going

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:38,390
to get hub at all and I think that we

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,390
you know a little self-promotion here

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,410
their project workflow is getup based or

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,090
do you mean they're actually cloning

00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,500
external code from github

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,090
I'm totally fine with using github as a

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,370
repository for doing your development

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,470
work that totally makes sense it's where

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:54,300
is the release is there a release on

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,850
drupal.org if there isn't a release on

00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,070
drupal.org it's a real than our security

00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,740
model fall is doing right so and I think

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,390
both panting and Acquia and others are

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,430
still putting out their releases on

00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,400
github or projects that they maintain I

00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,570
believe I mean you know and I think

00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,280
there's others that are doing this as

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,710
well because it's it's easier for

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,330
developers it's more convenient but we

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,860
have to take that extra opportunity to

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,300
check back into the community and to

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,810
make sure that that we're using

00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,400
drupal.org for for our that everyone's

00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:29,130
using that as the base still even if

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:32,280
your developments going elsewhere am i

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:34,020
going back in late so there's two

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,900
there's two sides to this one is the

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,460
fact that drupal.org isn't really what

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,410
we would think of as get yes there's a

00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,630
git server behind it but that's not low

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:46,230
development workflows were we're looking

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,480
at so taking this off for a second come

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,120
to my presentation at 6 p.m. today on

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,770
pull requests on drupal.org it's a core

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,020
conversation putting this back on the it

00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,700
does fall down and you know we we as the

00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,040
security team are not going to reach out

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,560
in force maintainer

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,030
- you know follow our processes in fact

00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,470
we gave them an option to opt out

00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,200
because maintainer x' wanted to the

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,760
ability to opt out so the way to handle

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,860
this is to put issues in their queue

00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,510
saying hey can you guys work with the

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,190
security team so that you can get

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:18,290
covered somehow there are projects that

00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,420
do the majority of their development on

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,420
github but then push back to drupal.org

00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,770
for releases so and from that

00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,080
perspective we cover them because their

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,210
get repos are on drupal.org as far as we

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,370
can tell and use and you know our

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,990
concern and they opt into all into our

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:36,050
projects but if you're running a module

00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,880
on drupal.org then you know there's not

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,250
much we're able to you know are not on

00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,540
drupal.org i should say we don't we

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,770
don't have the ability to reach out to

00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,540
you and say hey it looks like you wrote

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:49,250
a drupal module you will follow these

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:50,810
rules like and nor would we want to so

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,440
one quick thing I'd like to mention is

00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:57,640
that one of the problems that we have

00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,660
with 100 security releases last year is

00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,810
making sure we don't repeat the same

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:07,240
security issues on same modules again

00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:07,240
