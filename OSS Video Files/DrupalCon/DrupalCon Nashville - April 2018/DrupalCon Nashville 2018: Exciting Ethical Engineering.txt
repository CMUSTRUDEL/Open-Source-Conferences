Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Exciting Ethical Engineering
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	There is a lot of discussion about what ethical engineering is and how to "be an ethical engineer," but for folks working on and with open source software, there is not a lot of advice on how to be an ethical technology maker (including designer, programmer, content strategist, site-builder) in an open source context.

This lightning talk session will introduce audience members to several types of ethical frameworks, present case studies of ethical engineering failures (and successes), and discuss some guidelines that technology makers can use to think critically and ethically about their work.  If you think that sounds boring, don't worry! 

Similar to last year’s 100 Ways to be an Ally, this talk will be fast, action-packed and full of exciting philosophers, still-pretty-edgy ethical conclusions and epic tales of great engineering disasters.  



Attendees will leave with:

An understanding of several popular ethical frameworks

Guidelines they can use when determining whether or not a technical activity falls within their ethical guidelines

Resources for developing technical ethical literacy

An understanding of why ethical software engineering is important
