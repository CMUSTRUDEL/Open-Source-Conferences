Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Making Inclusion Happen Through Mentoring
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	In 2017, Palantir.net and Digital Bridge Solutions teamed up to start a small inclusion initiative with the hopes of increasing diversity in the Drupal community. This initiative was designed to invite and expose underrepresented people (whether they be underrepresented due to race, gender, economic status or other) to the Drupal community and opportunities therein. Due to a number of generous donations of tickets, time, and meeting rooms, we were able to host five students from NPower Baltimore to come to DrupalCon Baltimore for one day and get a quick introduction to Drupal. Activities included a 4 hour training, a talk outlining Drupal security topics, a networking lunch with Drupal shop executives and seasoned community members, and a meet and greet with a college graduate who recently joined ForumOne.

In 2018, Palantir expanded the original day-long format of this initiative to a 5-month training and mentorship program. With the assistance of FigLeaf Software (for 1:1 training), Drupalize.me (for supplemental help), and 11 mentors from across the Drupal community, Palantir is working with 11 enthusiastic students ages 18-24 (five from NPower Baltimore and six from Genesys Works in Chicago). Beginning with a kick off in both cities, both groups connected virtually from their respective city. Students participate in the program from January through May. All students will meet in person at both MidCamp and DrupalCon Nashville.    

As this is the first year we are doing this, this initiative is in a pilot stage. We’d love to show what is involved in actively bringing in people who have not had exposure to Drupal and share the lessons we’ve learned along the way. This session will cover the following:

Strategic partnerships: How to cultivate relationships with local non-profits and community organization
Recruitment strategy: Tapping into existing programs and pre-vetted participant pools
Implementation: What it takes, how to resource or pay for this initiative and associated challenges  
Student showcase: Student anecdotes and work completed to date
Measuring success: How to develop and measure learning outcomes
More doing: Ideas for making the Drupal Community more inclusive and reflective of the audiences that Drupal serves
We hope this initiative will encourage other Drupal firms to be able to start similar projects in their cities/regions. How can you build your own program? Or rethink your recruiting strategy?

This session is not technical, and is great for anyone who is interested in finding solutions to increasing diversity in the Drupal community.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
all right so we're gonna get started

00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:05,970
thank you everyone for joining me here

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,610
today again for those of you who just

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,800
came in I'm Michele Jackson I work at

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,780
Palantir as a web strategist and I'm

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,780
here with my colleague Allyson Manley

00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:21,840
something you do everything so it's hard

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,490
it's hard to have a you know a title

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,949
that encapsulates all the all that you

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,779
do but technically it's sales and

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,140
marketing managers but not somewhere in

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:34,410
so many hats so welcome and thank you

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,790
for joining us on essentially what is a

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:41,309
journey and what has been a journey for

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:44,219
us to engage folks from both Chicago and

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,950
Baltimore in the Drupal community and

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,850
give them a set of skills that will

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,010
allow them to not just explore Drupal

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,640
but also expand upon their existing

00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:01,440
skills technical skills so making

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,699
inclusion happen through mentoring today

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,309
we're gonna talk about the history of

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,200
our initiative we're going to talk a

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,689
little bit about what we did last year

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,610
at the 2017 Drupal con in Baltimore

00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:16,320
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,270
what we did this year in terms of our

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,250
mentorship and training program are we

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,140
talking about what we did and what went

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,860
well and then what went not so well and

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,500
we're also going to talk a little bit

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,509
about how we can measure success when

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,880
we're doing this type of initiative and

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,460
then what's next and then how you can

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,600
get involved as well and so if you're

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,630
wondering you know what is this

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,899
initiative what is this mentoring

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,979
essentially last-last I think it was

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,860
March

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,369
yeah boot camp I made camp 2017 Chris

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,659
Rooney gave a presentation about

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,840
essentially diversity within the Drupal

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,579
community and we had a lot of

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,159
contentious conversations at that time

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,590
happening in the community and Alison

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,420
and I wanted to focus on what we think

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,129
is important which is a little bit more

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,110
action-oriented and not as discourse

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,270
based so we decided we wanted to

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,590
actually take a more proactive approach

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,629
with getting folks

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,340
perhaps don't even know what Drupal is

00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,110
are not connected to the community

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,970
involved and given them an opportunity

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,730
to really get a taste of what this might

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,410
be like so we started brainstorming

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,650
after we heard Christopher and he's

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,310
walking in here just speak about

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,310
diversity in the community

00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:44,370
this was his presentation say hi

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:46,170
everyone so we did have quite of a

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,709
whirlwind for right after mid camp

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,060
luckily I was available to actually work

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,620
on this so Alison and I collaborated

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,610
really closely to get students from

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,590
Baltimore who are already involved with

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,049
npower which is a nonprofit that is

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,150
distributed throughout the country has

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:07,110
multiple chapters and we wanted to get

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,930
students involved in Drupal kana

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,450
essentially we wanted to give them the

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,040
opportunity to not only understand what

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,420
Drupal was but also meet other people

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,769
and in the community as well so

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,930
essentially what you're seeing here is a

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,350
day of Drupal we have a photo here of

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,019
the cohort of students that we actually

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,500
work to get into Drupal con for a day

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,290
and we gave them a really brief overview

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,069
of what Drupal is essentially how you

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,569
might apply some of you know these basic

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,889
Drupal con concepts to their

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,120
understanding of what they can do with

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,349
their own tech career so well these

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,299
students actually already had a

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,790
technical background a lot of them had

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,579
existing developer certifications but

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,000
didn't necessarily have access to or

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:56,370
know about Drupal and so Ryan actually

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,790
you know also led that training that day

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,109
and we also gave students an opportunity

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,299
to network with focus on the security

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,849
team I mean probably like well how did

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,620
you manage to get all of this done in

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,810
three weeks well my background is

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,630
actually in youth education so I used to

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,919
wrangle students for the State

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,620
Department and basically send them

00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,959
overseas so I'm quite familiar with the

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,489
wrangling of students so that's why we

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,010
were able to do it but essentially what

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,659
we identified during this process is

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,830
that partnerships are key you have to

00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:29,129
know who has

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,270
access to you know certain groups of

00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,620
students or certain groups of

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,689
professionals and really be able to

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,210
leverage those connections um that was

00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:38,520
really what has made this this process

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,069
and the project so successful has been

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,990
to leverage these existing not only

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:47,340
relationships but nonprofits that are

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,560
already well established did you want to

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,050
add anything to that yeah I would just

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,289
like to give major kudos to Michelle

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,080
because we did conceived of this after

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,090
Chris Rooney's talk last March of 2017

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,590
he said you know he's sort of threw down

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,120
the gauntlet and and challenged

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,759
everybody in the room and said what can

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,349
you do to increase diversity in Drupal

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,000
you know how can we make this an

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:11,789
actionable thing and I went up to him

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,830
afterwards and I said you know here's a

00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,750
simple thought what if we actually just

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,129
sponsored some students in Baltimore to

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,940
come to Drupal con Baltimore you know

00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,629
how hard could it be

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,789
haha how hard can it be so and we

00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:26,520
conveniently have Michelle who is based

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:28,319
in Baltimore on our team and who also at

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,930
the time was not resource to any project

00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,750
so she did have the time I had the time

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,229
and we were able to find an organization

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,210
local in Baltimore in npower that had

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,039
students that were very excited to come

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,750
and learn about Drupal for a day it was

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,440
literally just one day that was all we

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,000
could do we wrangled with some help from

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,620
some wonderful people in the drupal

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,150
community at the last minute to get free

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,779
tickets for all of them to come we

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,430
managed to arrange for other people in

00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,979
the community to come sit down with us

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,870
and have lunch after they had sort of

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,120
this half-day of an intro to Drupal and

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,830
for them to be able to attend some

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,779
sessions but it was just a really light

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,069
taste right just one day of Drupal con

00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:09,539
you know you've never heard of Drupal

00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,219
before and then you're thrown into this

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,270
huge Convention Center in downtown

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:17,460
Baltimore and so when we when we went

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,620
through this exercise of lunch and

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,750
talking with them we took a step back

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,150
after it was all over and said okay well

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,740
that was great how do we expand this and

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,419
make this something bigger and better so

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,099
then we started meeting internally and

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,440
talking about okay well what would it

00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:35,009
look like if we did try to make

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,389
something larger out of this and that

00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,489
brings us to you what we're working on

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,319
this year so

00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:42,239
essentially we wanted to understand is

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,739
this something that's scalable beyond

00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,599
not just one day but it is something

00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:48,449
that's scalable from a program

00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,399
perspective if we want to scale it who

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,289
you know are we hoping to get another

00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:56,009
npower chapter involved or are we gonna

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:58,129
be looking also more regional nonprofits

00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,899
that may not be tied to end power so

00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:02,279
essentially we had a lot of questions as

00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,809
we were going through this process you

00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,849
know capacity what happens when I'm not

00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:07,739
available what happens when Allison's

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:09,659
unavailable so we'll talk a little bit

00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:11,789
through that process shortly but I'll

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:15,089
just provide an overview of what the

00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:17,969
goals of the the program were coming out

00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:21,199
of last year's Drupal con so we wanted

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:23,399
to provide students young professionals

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,679
from underserved or underrepresented

00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:30,149
communities with Drupal training

00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:33,079
networking and then an opportunity to

00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:35,129
attend conferences and so essentially

00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,169
when we see training we mean not a

00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,729
one-day training but a more robust

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,379
training so that they're actually

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,889
equipped with skills to actually be able

00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:46,439
to build tools in Drupal we wanted to

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:48,240
have more students involved and that

00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,449
goes back to that question about scaling

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,300
we wanted to create a model that other

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,759
companies could either replicate or

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,939
perhaps improve upon and then also we

00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:04,649
wanted to expand our own support as a

00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:07,019
company to provide these underserved or

00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,779
underrepresented community members with

00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,759
access and inclusion within the

00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,550
community and one thing that came up as

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,169
we were finding these tickets for the

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,259
students the previous year is I was

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,860
actually a global attract chair

00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:25,379
previously so I had access to a lot of

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,969
speakers tracked chairs who had extra

00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,899
tickets or whose companies had extra

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:33,059
tickets and so through my own access to

00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,709
the know not only those resources but

00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,990
also those community members that we

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,699
were able to essentially connect with

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,620
the you know the DEA and and leverage

00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:43,469
that partnership to get the free tickets

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,269
that we did get so you know as we're

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,830
going through the process were we

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:50,420
understand kind of our own privilege as

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,700
being you know relatively embedded in

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,279
the community and and really hoping to

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,930
use that to give opportunity and access

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,370
to others who don't have those

00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,660
relationships don't know who a man is

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,370
who just came in and gave me a hug

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:07,370
perhaps are not connected with folks who

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:09,709
have extra tickets so looking forward at

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,930
2018 we decided to actually focus on

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,910
Chicago so our company is based in

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,579
Chicago and so as you were having this

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,170
conversation about capacity I mean a

00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,670
Baltimore was great because I'm there

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,440
and we have Meg Plunkett my colleague

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,540
who's in Philly and we have some other

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,730
folks on the East Coast now too but

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,190
Chicago is essentially our hub we have a

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,200
lot of folks in in Chicago who lived

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,880
there and worked for Palantir and so

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,790
just from a compact capacity standpoint

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,170
it made sense to identify a partner in

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:41,089
that region just because we have so many

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,670
colleagues who live there and then also

00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:45,290
that is our home base so that was a

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,690
strategic decision that we made after

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,459
talking about you know where where was

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,010
this program going to go and in what

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:54,200
region but to add to that when we were

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,640
talking with our contact at npower in

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,920
Baltimore and we asked her when we were

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,500
looking for a good Chicago partner to

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,850
partner up with she said well wait a

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,709
minute our Baltimore students who went

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,450
last year want to keep going you know is

00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,550
there any way you can keep us in the

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,190
fold and can we continue this and so we

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,540
decided actually to split it so we'd

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,279
have half the students coming out of

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,839
Baltimore half the students coming out

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,250
of Chicago because we did have a big

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,320
enough East Coast presence that we could

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,760
support that and then we just accounted

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,279
for that in our budget you know well

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,959
we've got to now fly people from

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,450
Baltimore to mid camp in Baltimore to

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,790
Nashville and so that was that was just

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,810
something we accounted for early on

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,779
something else that we were considering

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,270
so for npower I think we were just lucky

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,270
that you know when I was trying to

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:41,240
figure out what partners to connect with

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,050
and actually you know was npower was

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,310
referred to me by another nonprofit

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,140
potential nonprofit partner Baltimore

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,310
that could not work with us I think it

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,070
was code in the schools and so they

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,470
actually told us about npower but I

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,449
think we lucked out because empower has

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,300
several chapters throughout the US and

00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:01,100
then also our new partner our newest

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,230
partner Genesis works

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,210
several locations throughout the US so

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,900
when we were thinking about scale we

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:11,240
wanted a nonprofit that was distributed

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,760
just like the Drupal community because

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,550
our goal essentially was to essentially

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,890
identify other partners and agencies and

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,390
mentors to actually connect them with

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,030
students that are in their own region as

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:26,890
well and so you'll see here on the left

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:29,720
empower has you know international

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:32,290
presence as well in Toronto and then we

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,690
have other they have west coast we have

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:40,460
Texas we have East Coast as well and

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,770
then we have you know Chicago Texas

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,430
again we have Minnesota so we wanted to

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,170
have a broad reach and a lot of

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,250
potential in terms of reaching other

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,870
students who were outside of the

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:56,120
chapters with whom we're currently

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:58,910
working so now were gonna talk about how

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,850
we did this on how we structured the

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,950
program so going back to 2017 we did

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,660
consider actually identifying high

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,850
school students that was going to be

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,520
very difficult because of the waves

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,940
schools run and when students are in

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,590
school and parents and permission and

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,790
absences so essentially that was

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,040
something we learned really quickly was

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,310
not going to work for a and April

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,090
conference so essentially we wanted to

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,850
identify folks who were not in high

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,420
school but perhaps you know early 20s

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,340
late teens who are looking to expand

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,580
their professional opportunities we

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,900
wanted to essentially identify students

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,490
who were already within an existing

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,440
program that another nonprofit was

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,830
running so we wanted to focus on a pre

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,940
vetted pool of students not necessarily

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,700
fill out the you know Palantir

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,520
application but students who are already

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,890
committed to another organizations

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,460
program who are already working on

00:12:53,890 --> 00:13:01,220
developing their skills doing some type

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,730
of training of some sort just because it

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,750
makes it easier to get them engaged

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,940
versus perhaps doing a more grassroots

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:12,470
approach of recruiting applicants on our

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,670
own we had a lot of questions about how

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,579
do we get the students from Baltimore to

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,379
speak to this to

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:20,209
in Chicago and when are we going to have

00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:22,920
trainings ultimately we adopted a remote

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:25,889
distributed training program where

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,259
essentially we had slack as our medium

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:32,399
for communication and then also did

00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:36,720
virtual training once a week with with

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,869
two labs so we had one opportunity for

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,429
in-person training which was a kickoff

00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:46,799
and essentially after that everything

00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:49,949
was done remotely in terms of our format

00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,970
we were looking at mid camp as a program

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:54,899
checkpoint and midpoint so that we could

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,839
essentially connect with the students

00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,249
again and bring everybody to Chicago and

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,009
then of course all the students would

00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:08,999
convene in in Nashville for DrupalCon

00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:10,679
as well and so this was our idea and and

00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,839
the concept that we ultimately went with

00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:18,239
in terms of what expansion would look

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:19,799
like what 2018 would look like we we

00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:22,350
were really concerned about ensuring

00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,239
continued student participation which is

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,480
something that will is a pain point that

00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:30,839
we'll talk about shortly but when we're

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,239
dealing with students who are not in

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,799
high school or are not doing a summer

00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,079
program for instance where they have

00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,540
unlimited time to dedicate to our

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,419
program it's always about balancing

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,429
conflicting priorities so a lot of the

00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:47,660
students do we have are working in

00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:50,009
multiple jobs or internships are

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,029
potentially doing other training and

00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:56,369
educational programs may be doing other

00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:57,959
other activities related to the

00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:00,329
nonprofit or the program that they're

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,489
associated with our partner so it's a

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,769
lot to juggle to ask them to actually do

00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:06,299
our program on top of everything else so

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,829
they are not full-time students they're

00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,049
Mavericks they're juggling a lot of

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,519
different types of things and then a lot

00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:13,559
of them have things going on in their

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,169
personal life as well a lot of them have

00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,160
personal responsibility so that's

00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,169
something that we want to open the

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,639
conversation up to you about a later is

00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,009
just you know ensuring continued

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,289
engagement and participation we have a

00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,449
mentorship program in place for these

00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,910
students but are always curious to talk

00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,800
about

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,830
how we can best support students

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,810
throughout the process do you have

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:39,160
anything else done so as Alison had

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,710
mentioned we wanted to continue the

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,350
empower partnership because our point of

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,970
contact at empower Kathy still wanted to

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,400
have students engage the students were

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,360
still interested in participating beyond

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,350
2017 we created new strategic

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,570
partnerships with Genesis works fig-leaf

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,550
Drupal ëismí and then others and so one

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,580
of the key milestones in our planning

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,540
was actually deciding whether or not

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,830
Palantir would run the training or

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,160
whether we would outsource the training

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,010
to a Drupal training expert and we went

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,710
with a ladder because from a capacity

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,380
standpoint it was easier for us to find

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,960
someone who does this professionally as

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,550
a service from a company standpoint

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,910
because it was easier for them to

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,800
actually just implement a training and

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,080
and provide access to that training for

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,370
the students versus having us develop

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:35,710
our own training independently so that

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,360
made that process relatively smooth

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,430
because we didn't have to create all the

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,800
materials ourselves and we could use

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,930
what they currently use to train

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,400
developers and other folks learning

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:51,400
Drupal mentorship by professionals

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,990
throughout the community so previously

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,110
might have heard me mention kind of the

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,270
need to have a 2-0 strategic partners

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,430
that have chapters all over the US so

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:03,370
similarly we wanted to have mentors who

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,890
were also distributed so we have folks

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:09,310
who are mentoring the students virtually

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:11,110
from all over the US currently we have

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,910
you know I'm in Baltimore but their

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,910
other mentors who were I think we have

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,950
one in Massachusetts all over so

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,530
essentially that was really key as well

00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:23,230
I mean we had talked about the need for

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,600
having a mentor in person or or not in

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,400
person and we decided that as long as

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,560
there's frequent touch points so we

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,110
actually didn't need to have a mentor

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,120
that was in person on the ground I do

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,010
think there's value and having that but

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,770
we found that it was not necessary in

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,300
terms of the coaching that would that

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,720
would complement the training that we

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,720
were running

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,570
so some of the questions that we were

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,820
tackling while we were coming up with an

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,080
implementation plan were you know who

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,700
was going to do the training we decided

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,140
with that fig leaf would be doing that

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,850
but you know where is it's gonna live

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,080
where is it going to be hosted you know

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,020
where are students going to have their

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,279
projects you know where where is it's

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:06,320
going to live we wanted to address both

00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,080
technology and hosting needs because we

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,809
weren't sure if the students would have

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,610
Mac laptops um and so we wanted to make

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,760
or access to the Internet regularly

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,610
I know Baltimore specifically doesn't

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,039
have significant density in terms of

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,390
Internet access all across the city so

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,309
we didn't want to make assumptions about

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,940
you know access to Starbucks because if

00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:30,260
students are in certain communities

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,789
where they don't have those resources

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,260
they might have to take an hour bus to

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,059
get there so you know these were things

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,649
that we were thinking about we didn't

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,480
end up providing Internet but we did

00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:41,539
provide laptops that were refurbished

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,070
just so that they had that and then they

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,450
might have to worry about a mobility

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,590
issue of getting to a you know point a

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,149
to get the Internet but they don't have

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,179
to worry about you know I don't have a

00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:53,149
laptop also you know where are they

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:54,679
going to be training you know what types

00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,419
of hosting environments do they need for

00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,210
what they're going to be building that

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:01,309
was something that we had to wrangle a

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,429
little bit had some hiccups at mid camp

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:07,070
do you want to talk about that so right

00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:09,830
a couple days before mid camp there the

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:12,830
hosting that they were on expired and so

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,299
what was lovely was that at mid camp of

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,909
course there was a large team of

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,130
Pantheon employees who were very happy

00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,500
to come in and they spent a couple hours

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,779
just making sure everyone was put up on

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,789
a Pantheon environment and spun up and

00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:28,340
and it was all said and done in a few

00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:30,169
hours and but that was that was one of

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,610
those things we hadn't anticipated you

00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,230
know now that we've done this pilot

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,549
program once there are a few there are a

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,320
few things I'd do differently moving

00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:38,750
forward you know we did a lot of things

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,070
right I'd say about 80 85 percent of the

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,450
things we did right there's definitely

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,640
some things we want to smooth out moving

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,890
forward that was one of them I would say

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,679
the other was yesterday when my plane

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,570
got delayed by a freak snowstorm in

00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,309
Chicago and I had students trying to

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,870
check in to the Holiday Inn and they

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,760
needed a credit card to put down

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,070
and I was not there to provide a credit

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,930
card so thankfully one of my other

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,650
colleagues you know I'm on the tarmac

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:06,300
saying please help me get a credit card

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,880
so we were that was one of those things

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,300
you can't anticipate but I'll file it

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,830
away for future reference

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,160
another question we had was getting them

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:20,760
to Chicago in Nashville you know when do

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,900
we book those flights how do we fund you

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,430
know paying for those flights is that

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,559
something that Palantir incurs is that

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,530
something that will get outside support

00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,510
for we ended up incurring the cost for

00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,130
those as part of Allison's marketing

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,410
budget you know where are they going to

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,940
stay I'm gonna stay in a hotel or they

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,590
can stay in a hotel by the conference or

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,100
gonna stay in a hostel

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,540
another question is just you know who do

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,400
we need to notify like you know

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,750
emergency contacts was something we were

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,590
thinking of to you just because

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:52,740
technically you know everybody is of age

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,080
I think you know eighteen or older but

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,400
again you know who do we call if

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,970
somebody sprains an ankle again like I

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,760
said who will pay for kind of the cost

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,140
of coming to Nashville how do we get

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,360
mentors and then what are the

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,100
expectations you know do we just say we

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,200
want you to talk to them about something

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,000
twice a week or once a month and then

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,250
what do we tell them to talk about is it

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,170
really focused on their long-term

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,710
professional goals or is it focused on

00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,809
the training we didn't really nail that

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,460
down we we just wanted mentors to be

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,929
available to answer questions in terms

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,090
of the training but that was a question

00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:31,740
that we had when we were identifying

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,440
mentors and coming up with the idea of

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,270
having that tertiary support so we have

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,280
our lab our class there was an

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,350
instructor Ryan attended all of the

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,950
classes and labs with the exception of

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:46,050
maybe like I don't know one or two so he

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,490
was always present but we understood

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,520
that you know having everybody go to

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,960
Ryan also was a lot to ask so I'm

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,800
wanting to distribute some of that

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,559
support was key the other question was

00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:01,080
who is going to review student work so

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:05,940
my background is primarily in research

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,740
and UX so essentially I can I'm happy to

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,929
sit in but what I'm able to so

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,029
the students and is a little bit limited

00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,130
so you know not just having people

00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:16,899
available but having people available

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,789
who are capable of providing the support

00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:20,860
that students need so we always had to

00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,570
have somebody attending the lab who

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,059
could answer questions for the students

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:29,529
that that related to what they were

00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:32,260
being trained on and then at mid camp I

00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:34,240
think we ended up corralling some pollen

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,039
teary to review student work I know

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,539
Lauren is here and Lauren spent some

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,929
time with students reviewing their

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:42,279
projects they'll talk about shortly so

00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:45,940
definitely it's very much an agile

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,860
project I would say it's probably one of

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,220
the more agile projects I've done since

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,529
I've been at Palantir so so that's

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,690
something that I think I'm grateful for

00:22:53,529 --> 00:23:01,929
because we were able to modify our

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,990
programmatic approach as needs changed

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:08,980
throughout the course of the program

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:11,230
this is a timeline of what the program

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,960
looked at from a bird's eye view from

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,549
the kickoff in January 2018 where we

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,980
gave the students their refurbished

00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:20,470
laptops and then began to pair them with

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,200
mentors all the way to the beginning of

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,299
classes mid camp that checkpoint or

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,059
milestone and then we have DrupalCon

00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:29,620
and then you know we're hoping to talk

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,289
to students about where they go from

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,240
here I know for me one of the things I

00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:35,710
talked about was Drupal gov con so the

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,590
Baltimore students you know it's a free

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,809
conference it's relatively close to

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,480
Baltimore so seeing if the students can

00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,399
get engaged with that conference is

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,350
something that's on my mind but also

00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:52,570
thinking about this more broadly you

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:55,090
know do we connect Drupal shops with an

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,919
power and Genesis works chapters in

00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,890
other areas ideally yes that's what we

00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:02,260
want to do just so that we can ensure

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:06,429
that we're actually able to create a

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,320
framework that can support students not

00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,620
just the ones that we are training and

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,120
mentoring currently but other ones who

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,120
have similar interests and needs as well

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:25,330
so this is a photo from the genesis

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:29,039
Works kickoff so these are the

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:33,370
chicago-based students with Lauren and

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,980
then this is the Baltimore cohort as

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,980
well on the same day so it's really neat

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,230
that we were able to have two in-person

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,090
meetings and then connect virtually and

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,539
then having the students all meet up in

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,539
in Chicago

00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,710
I think we used Adobe do we used Adobe

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:03,450
Connect yeah you know Dave from fig-leaf

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:05,460
who's there on the far right um he uh he

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,960
was our partner at fig-leaf who actually

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,100
led the training every Friday evening

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,379
and that was the evening that the

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,960
students via a survey said was the best

00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:15,600
night for them to have their formal

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,950
class we had lab hours one hour on

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,590
Wednesday and then there were two

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,570
options on Thursdays you didn't have to

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,369
attend all of them we just recommended

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,679
you attend at least one so that you

00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:27,539
could check in and mentors would come to

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,710
those lab hours as they could also come

00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,600
you know whatever worked for their

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,460
schedules between those three choices

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,529
during the week and then there was the

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,210
formal class time and that was all

00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,769
recorded as well because there were some

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,240
students who Friday night just didn't

00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:41,369
work for them it worked for the majority

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,749
but not for everybody so there were some

00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:44,369
students who I don't think attended a

00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,809
live class ever but always watch the

00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:48,389
recordings and were able to keep doing

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:51,179
their work through the course of the of

00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:52,799
the program yeah one student said that

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,809
that was what was really helpful is

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,730
actually having access to the recordings

00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,379
because again like I mentioned before a

00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,730
lot of students are doing a lot of

00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:01,710
things at the same time they have the

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,450
personal life they have multiple

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,399
professional lives and then some of them

00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,369
are also doing additional training as

00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,869
well so that flexibility I think was key

00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,549
one student had said you know I like

00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:14,730
that we have that flexibility that we

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:17,429
have access to the video recordings and

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,059
that we are maybe not attending the same

00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,129
labs

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,629
and may not always be in class but we're

00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:24,450
working towards the same goal so there's

00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:26,730
still a sense of shared community across

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,100
the cohort as well and I'll let the

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:34,379
students who are actually here share

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:37,230
with you their project shortly so in

00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:40,190
terms of what we covered it wasn't just

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,659
this is how you Drupal we talked about

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,369
goals of your site why you would want to

00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:47,039
build a website in the first place I

00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:51,450
think a key question was to help them

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:54,389
see a problem in their community and

00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,789
then figure out how to address it with

00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:58,740
Drupal so we have a lot of really neat

00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:00,600
community projects that students are

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,210
working on that really to music churches

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,680
a mariachi band and so students were

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:11,250
able to create a nexus between an issue

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,960
related to content or marketing in their

00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,760
community and then tie it back to Drupal

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,040
which has been really exciting but they

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,350
went over analytics content modeling

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,900
content types and fields information

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,120
architecture menu blocks forums and

00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,330
social media so essentially this is a

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:34,800
crash course in in Drupal that covers a

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:37,560
lot of other strategic pieces as well so

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,600
in terms of what we learned we learn it

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:44,840
scheduling is really hard really hard

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,700
sustainability is also a big pain point

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,650
because my initial involvement was very

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,890
much based on my circumstances then and

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,900
my availability where I didn't have a

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,360
lot of project work and then when I did

00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,580
I couldn't play as active as a role as I

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,160
had previously which I knew coming out

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,890
of the con last year but in terms of how

00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,340
do we then you know make sure that

00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:10,860
Alison isn't resource to this project 80

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,030
hours a week mmm since Alison does have

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,850
other roles as well was something that

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,440
you know constantly came up you know

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:20,220
balancing from a student perspective

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,680
class life work attrition we did have

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,800
some students essentially drop out of

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,170
the program so anticipating that was

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,150
something that we did but developing an

00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,980
action plan is something that I think we

00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,180
still need to do yeah so initially when

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,400
we talked about cap at you know

00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,780
expansion you know one colleague I said

00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,700
well let's just have a few students and

00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,580
I said from what I know with you that

00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,620
education we should definitely have more

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,420
students because there will be attrition

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,340
but how do we mitigate that is a

00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,880
question I think that warrants further

00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,700
discussion managing expectations you

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,370
know how do we get funding and from whom

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:59,370
delegation especially when you have

00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:01,860
conflicting resourcing communication the

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:05,640
logistics not just around travel but

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,260
also having students connect with each

00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,720
other throughout the program and stay

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,240
engaged and involved was something that

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,850
came up time and time and again limited

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,230
time money resources came up quite

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,850
frequently as well and then also how do

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,470
we measure what success looks like was

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,360
something that I think we're still we're

00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,059
still grappling with

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,650
because it is in a pilot phase but you

00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:28,250
know what is successes I mean that they

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,750
have a you know Minimum Viable Product

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,860
you know is it that the website is

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,350
workable usable or is it something else

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,210
you know is it that they get a job in a

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:41,000
parallel feel is it that they get a job

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,470
at a Drupal shop you know what does

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,240
success alike look like it's still

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,190
something that were we're we're

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,960
contemplating and and you can join us at

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,010
lunch with them all this week if you'd

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,390
like to talk with them about possible

00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:55,040
internships I'll just throw that out

00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:57,140
there I think the question that Ryan

00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,970
posed was you know mentoring when does

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,250
this begin and when does does it end

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,679
ever I think Ryan had said mentoring is

00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,880
technically a lifetime commitment so

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,410
you're not necessarily hi I'm gonna

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,610
mentor you for five weeks and then I'm

00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,710
gonna drop off the face of the earth

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,950
ideally you want to be able to create a

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:15,320
relationship that you know essentially

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,820
outlast the program so how do we do that

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,020
that goes back to managing expectations

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:22,790
with mentors I think we had three lab

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,640
hours but there were only about half the

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:27,590
students who were incredibly active you

00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,010
know so I think you know within the lab

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:33,110
and so our expectations reasonable is it

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,540
asking too much I mean these are things

00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,040
were constantly re-evaluating evaluating

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:41,780
initially we thought we could do a

00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,010
two-hour class once a week but that made

00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:48,290
schedule II just made this very

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:52,790
difficult I think right now we don't

00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:55,309
have a strong model to assess success

00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:57,740
we don't have grades and midterms so

00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,150
that's definitely something that we're

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,290
still thinking about and we did take

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,580
attendance for a few weeks but you know

00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,620
you have some students who are attending

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,570
and some students who are not but are

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,700
watching the video recordings we don't

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,850
really have you know google analytics

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,440
for our program so to make an assumption

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,330
about engagement is also not fair

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,040
because some students might be you know

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,270
juggling the million things that they

00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,669
juggle but then also watching the

00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,690
recordings and so that's something we're

00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:26,419
thinking about you

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,610
you know do we have you know learning

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,710
assessments is it really just going to

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:33,539
be about their project and do they hit

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:38,489
this particular milestone

00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:40,830
I think a question one person asked was

00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:43,049
you know if we had this in person you

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,960
know would would that make things easier

00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:47,009
right if we had the students in Chicago

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,350
attaint you know attend a weekly

00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:51,359
training in person and then the

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:55,639
Baltimore students do the same thing I

00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:59,279
don't know I think that engagement and

00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:02,100
participation is not necessarily always

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,529
constrained by whether something is

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,499
remote or not I think that if we had had

00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:09,570
in person I I I'd argue that we might

00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:11,369
see similar patterns of people not

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,070
showing up for class that's just been my

00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:17,609
experience with with youth education so

00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:20,609
I don't know that in-person would always

00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:22,499
at least training would necessarily

00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:25,739
create kind of more engagement I do

00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:27,899
think in-person checkpoints with mentors

00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:29,729
might help because it increases

00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:32,519
accountability and then you have a

00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:35,369
better rapport potentially and and to

00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,879
add to that we did actually the genesis

00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:41,009
works folks Julia is here from Genesis

00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:43,739
works who is their alumni coordinator

00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:46,739
she and Chris Rooney actually did I

00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:48,779
believe twice get together at digital

00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:51,599
bridges offices so that everyone could

00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:55,229
work together and talk about how things

00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,119
were going and you know just especially

00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:58,979
when it came like what to what to focus

00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,729
on for mid camp you know what to focus

00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,019
on for DrupalCon

00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,669
so there were some touch points

00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:05,129
physically where the students got

00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:07,710
together in Chicago that was not

00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:09,450
something we did in Baltimore in

00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,820
retrospect that probably would have been

00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:14,879
a great idea but again it was just a

00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:17,429
matter of resources and you know lessons

00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:21,809
learned that we I think we would like to

00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:23,489
implement moving forward so again I

00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:25,499
think measuring success is definitely

00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:28,349
something that we're still working on I

00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:29,849
think the way I think about it is you

00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:32,999
know formulating a series of questions

00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:36,059
the way I do with projects and you know

00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:38,070
thinking about it in this context so

00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:41,609
this is kind of where we are we're still

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,739
in the you know inquisitive phase about

00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:44,999
how we would go about doing this but

00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:46,630
here are some ideas that we have and

00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:48,970
then after our session

00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,520
clues we open will open the floor to get

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,540
your ideas as well so you know what do

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,780
students know at the start of the

00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:58,750
program you know what do we want them to

00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,290
learn why and then how do we measure

00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,410
that

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,600
the other one is you know what does

00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,990
attendance and there's a tendon s'matter

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,669
is it you know bodies and rooms people

00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,980
just showing up to mid campus that

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:13,690
success or is it actually having you

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,200
know a website that your community can

00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:19,780
actually use is it having content that

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,080
makes sense within the website that

00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,700
you've built you know our students

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,770
merely gonna meet curriculum milestones

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:32,260
or again is it about the usability of

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:36,300
and it's essentially the the function of

00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:42,159
the website is it launching the website

00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,629
is it a percentage is it how often

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,379
students check in with Mentors

00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:49,629
is it also something that we can change

00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,580
mid program because that's not really

00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,750
how you know we usually with Google

00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,370
Analytics you know it's a parallel

00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,139
example you're not supposed to change

00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,880
kind of how you measure things in the

00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,470
middle of you know something cuz you'll

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,140
lose that data right so then if we are

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,910
making modifications does that then have

00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,820
implications for how we're measuring

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,950
what success looks like something else

00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,810
is you know what happens after the

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,510
program you know I mentioned Drupal gov

00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:16,180
con but you know again mentorship is a

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,940
lifetime commitment so what does that

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,290
post program engagement look like so

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,910
these are all things that were thinking

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:25,690
about we've thought about using surveys

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:28,960
and one-on-ones to gauge but again this

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:33,030
is a little bit more nebulous than a cut

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,110
and dry program that you might see with

00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:41,470
nonprofits that are well-established

00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:45,190
in this area so here's an example at mid

00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:47,560
camp you know we did have Palantir II

00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:50,020
helped students review their work to

00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,720
date and then that way they were able to

00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:55,890
gauge kind of pain points in areas where

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,890
they needed help

00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,630
here they are last night yeah

00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,940
everyone to get that I think that's

00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,380
everyone but one who you know again talk

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,120
about work commitments she couldn't miss

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,890
work yesterday so she had to fly in very

00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,410
late she did not make it to her hotel

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:18,410
last night until 1:15 in the morning but

00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:21,230
she is here but yeah and so at this

00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:24,680
point like I mentioned before students

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,030
are we're coming in now are doing a lot

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,310
of these personal projects that have a

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,320
community focus so I'd mentioned before

00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,340
there's a mariachi band I love that

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,650
you're coming in here while I'm talking

00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:39,980
about you a church a music act a

00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:43,460
recycling blog tech help blog and then

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,040
some others as well and so we wanted to

00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:49,820
like I mentioned before give them a

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:52,880
well-rounded you know training that

00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,140
encompassed both UX and strategy I'm not

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,100
just Drupal because we don't want them

00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,540
to just to build build build you want

00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,670
them to think about why they're building

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,410
and then what model in your life makes

00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:03,260
the most sense or problem in your life

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:05,420
makes the most sense in terms of using

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:13,850
that as a platform for a Drupal project

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:16,850
I think we have about 60% Drupal or 70%

00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:19,310
ripple and then 30% non Drupal but we're

00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:22,100
hoping that they can take some of the

00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:25,070
lessons that we taught to you know about

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:28,130
identifying audience needs and planning

00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:30,620
your menu structure and actually can

00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,600
carry some of those skills and knowledge

00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:36,710
into their next job even if that's not

00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,750
within a Drupal context I think we're

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,190
thinking about resume workshops as well

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,020
just to make sure that the way that

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,580
they're communicating their skills make

00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,610
sense for the job that they're looking

00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,440
for and then also hoping to do some

00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:51,290
coaching around interviewing and then

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,760
also I was thinking about Drupal gov con

00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,770
for the baltimore-based students just

00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,720
because it's so close and some of the

00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,400
resume workshop work is actually

00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,960
happening tomorrow like the a lot of the

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,220
students did bring their resumes already

00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,330
but our HR staff at Palantir is going to

00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,770
be sitting down with them tomorrow to

00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,090
look over their resumes and see if

00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,280
there's any polishing that we can help

00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,560
them with

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,730
and also I'll mention this again we're

00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,740
really curious about what you think we

00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,720
could do differently and also if you're

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,240
interested in starting a similar program

00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,340
or joining the program in your own

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,990
communities because we can always do

00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,220
things better and as we mentioned we're

00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:30,550
definitely learning as we're going along

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,140
and I think interestingly a lot of my

00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,890
background actually you know we would

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,780
have had a credit card authorization

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:38,170
right we would have had a lot of these

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,240
things and so because I am NOT doing

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,760
that full-time anymore you know it was

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,050
difficult for me to he said hey Allison

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,430
here is like all the things that you

00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,260
need for our youth program because you

00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:50,950
know I'm coming in here and there and

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,780
again it's a capacity question well

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,980
there was a snowstorm there was a beam I

00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:58,390
was supposed to be there today

00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:01,150
exactly but because I know we're running

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,280
low on time so some of the lessons that

00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,960
we did learn definitely that identifying

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,050
the strategic partnerships upfront was

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,340
key finding the right students I mean I

00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,650
don't know how else we would have found

00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,330
students just on our own to do this but

00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,770
having having organizations that already

00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:19,680
had students that were interested in

00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:23,320
code was a great thing and then also

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,820
just being able to have the time the

00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,430
retrospective that we were able to do

00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,050
last year after our one day at DrupalCon

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,350
to sit down and sort of implement the

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:34,150
plan to the degree that we did obviously

00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,910
we can fill in some more details now

00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,830
that we've done this for a year but but

00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,690
we'll be having a retrospective after

00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,330
this one as well just to see how we can

00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:45,280
implement this moving forward the one

00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:49,030
thing I would like to talk about is that

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,500
this was not free I speaking of

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,530
privilege I have the privilege of being

00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:56,230
in charge of my budget so when I was

00:39:53,530 --> 00:40:00,190
outlining my budget for all of how we

00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,140
were going to for all of my needs within

00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,660
Palantir for marketing and sales sales

00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,520
trips conferences that we have to attend

00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,480
I wanted to put some aside some money to

00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,720
make this successful

00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,970
so Palantir actually in hard costs

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,010
donated $8,000 which really was

00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:17,980
allocated mostly to travel that was

00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:20,170
hotel that was plane tickets DrupalCon

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,640
tickets and mid camp tickets were

00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:25,540
donated thanks to those organization

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,580
of course the mentors gave their time

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,000
Palantir also donated 11 refurbished

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,800
laptops and but fig-leaf

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,780
actually donated more I mean their

00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,300
donation of the classes was about

00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,460
$12,000 in costs because to take one of

00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:44,570
their basic Drupal classes is about

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:46,700
$1,100 a person so then of course do

00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,250
peláez me and aqueous did donate some

00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,500
subscription and hosting fees and then

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:55,520
we did later on after this slide was

00:40:51,500 --> 00:41:00,650
made got some donations from JetBrains

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,510
okay thank you and then of course and

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,570
then also at the last minute to help us

00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,940
offset some costs ashley 7a of blue

00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:09,590
spark when I was telling her that the

00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,300
hotel rooms in Nashville were actually

00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,830
coming out more expensive than I thought

00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,050
they were she said you know what we have

00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:17,810
a whole extra Airbnb house would you

00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:20,930
like to have it so she very graciously

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:22,310
donated one of her two houses that they

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,290
had reserved so we were able to help

00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:26,480
split some cost that way but this as far

00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:29,270
as hard cost was was what it cost

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,830
Palantir to do this so if that is scary

00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:35,720
to your organization if you're not able

00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:37,250
to support that type of lift and also

00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,840
you know we can't expect fig-leaf to be

00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:42,140
donating for everybody right you know

00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,510
like that's that's a big ask but you

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,100
know maybe don't start with 10 to 12

00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,900
students start smaller start with 3

00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,300
start with 2 whatever you can do but

00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,460
that that is just something I want to

00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,770
put out there is that even even though

00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,030
there was a lot of time donated there

00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,370
were actually some hard costs as well

00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,630
another way to think about it too is you

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,780
know when you have brown bags but you

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,730
have colleagues share their expertise in

00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,890
a particular area they talk about a case

00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,600
study think about you know if you do

00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,610
have if you if you aren't distributed or

00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,170
even if you are you know when you have a

00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,800
co-working space and you have a session

00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,420
right

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,530
think about who you're inviting think

00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,360
about who you're including I just read a

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,640
blog post was actually about diversity

00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,020
and the idea of diversity itself and one

00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,570
of the main goals here was to kind of

00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,550
strip that and talk about access strip

00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,870
that term away and say like who are you

00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,190
inviting hearing networking with who

00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,600
you're connecting with who comes to your

00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,730
parties who comes to your Drupal events

00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,320
who comes to your you know UX meetups

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,640
who are you associating with because

00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,920
that is that that has a root of the

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,720
shoe not so much you know this diversity

00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,510
term you know I am diverse you were not

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,819
you know it that creates a dichotomy of

00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,769
basically you're another and I am NOT

00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:47,779
and I'm part of this and you're not and

00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:49,609
so instead you know thinking about it in

00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:52,460
terms of like when you look around and

00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:54,049
you think about you know not just who's

00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,549
in a room but who are you going to get

00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:57,319
drinks with who are you going to like

00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:59,150
talk about this module with who are you

00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:02,869
planning to do you know to submit that

00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,160
issue on you know drupal.org and and and

00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:05,900
create a program or create an

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,180
improvement in a specific area thinking

00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,440
about like that type of inclusion is

00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,089
really where we're going with this

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,769
versus kind of eight you know there's a

00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,599
diversity problem there's an access

00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:16,430
problem and there was a problem with you

00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,589
know habits and there's a problem with

00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,359
who you know we associate and network

00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:22,010
with and who makes us comfortable and

00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,839
who are comfortable being around so

00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,609
really tackling this from more of a you

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,140
know community grassroots perspective

00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:29,390
where it's about you know taking

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,880
someone's hand and saying do enjoy join

00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,220
us for this coffee meetup you know join

00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,049
us for this particular event that is

00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,180
really what we think needs to happen and

00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:40,279
so Allison says the budget might be a

00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,509
bit tight for some folks but definitely

00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:43,220
there's other ways that are affordable

00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:46,490
where you can include people and invite

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,980
folks who are from you know either you

00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:51,890
know tech oriented nonprofits and have

00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:54,410
them be a part of community events have

00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,720
to be a part of an open house and just

00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,240
get them you know in the door get them

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,950
to meet folks and that's free for most

00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,710
people if you have an existing event or

00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:05,960
program the other thing I wanted to

00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:09,230
point out is that we are this is not an

00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,630
original idea by any means we just had

00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,130
the ability to implement it but Rachel

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:15,259
from the DEA had hooked me up with

00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,630
Crispin down here on the bottom who is

00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:19,460
doing something very similar in England

00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,099
he has the benefit of government money

00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,230
so they were able to do this with a

00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:25,730
government funded apprenticeship but

00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,170
they've been doing something similar for

00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,069
about five years which is pretty

00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,049
exciting

00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:32,960
so that's his website if you want to

00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:34,640
check it out because it's pretty

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,970
fascinating and he's got a little bit

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,950
more structure to his program than we

00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:42,349
certainly have to ours and I'm I'm

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,779
definitely going to add that you know

00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,490
this took a very large village of people

00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:47,550
you'll see the list of names of all the

00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,610
people that helped us in

00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:52,230
some way or another this it was a long

00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,730
list I mean we had a bunch of mentors

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,460
help us out we had a lot of people

00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:58,380
organizing in a variety of ways and then

00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,020
we had additional support everyone from

00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,840
you know donating a house to donating

00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,400
subscriptions to things to stepping in

00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,250
at the last minute helping us with

00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,610
hosting when hosting blew up at mid camp

00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:13,290
so there was a lot of hands in this and

00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,140
we really appreciate everyone's help in

00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,700
just trying to bring in new faces into

00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,290
Drupal you know I mean I think it's I

00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,120
think and that's part of what we were

00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:24,330
trying to do was you know there are a

00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,890
lot of many many people who have never

00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,990
heard of Drupal at all but are very

00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,180
talented you know how do we invite them

00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,710
in so this was our way of taking their

00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,020
hand and bringing them in and say hey

00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:35,550
there's this amazing thing called Drupal

00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,380
we'd like to introduce you to it

00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,180
we'd like to train you in it a little

00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,590
bit and then if you decide you know it's

00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,930
up to you if you want to decide that you

00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,340
want to keep going with it we can help

00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,350
you and support you in that and here's a

00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:50,340
seat at the table yeah that's kind of

00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:53,280
the message we want to give so Before we

00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,420
jump into kind of actually before we do

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,130
that I would like the students to

00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,090
actually introduce themselves and talk a

00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,630
little bit about the work you've done

00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,340
today

00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,660
would you would you be willing to step

00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:09,900
up to the mic and share a little bit

00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:17,820
about your experience let's get a hand

00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:19,650
for the students hi Damien hello

00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,340
everyone my name is Joseph Patterson and

00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:26,340
I'm with Genesis works in Chicago yeah

00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:29,400
basically I was introduced to Drupal

00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:32,040
through Genesis works and given the

00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,590
opportunity to learn more about site

00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:38,820
building I expressed interest in

00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:40,620
technology at a in high school and for

00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:44,390
me it was more about finding

00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:48,390
opportunities that aligned with how to

00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:51,810
make my interests come into action if

00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:55,050
you will so yeah this is like a perfect

00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:57,540
segue and to get into you know learn

00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,090
more about site building and stuff but

00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,870
yeah for me I've been going

00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:04,740
through the course and mentoring with

00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:07,530
Damien as my mentor

00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:10,440
so we meet every week and yeah we just

00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:13,200
go over things about Drupal and how to

00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,060
get more custom to it but I basically

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,720
just wanted to start off with something

00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:21,180
that was more personal to me and kind of

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,920
getting myself more accustomed to what

00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:27,540
Drupal is so I started off with like a a

00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,600
personal site a portfolio site so

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,520
getting myself out there I went it to in

00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,990
the future if I ever wanted to look for

00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,390
an internship and stuff like that I

00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:39,240
wanted to build a site that had my

00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:41,400
resume my social media links and all

00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,730
that so you know people could just go

00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,860
there see what I'm able to do and then

00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,930
you know based off of that it would I

00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:52,290
just get to know more about me but yeah

00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:54,570
through this mentorship mentoring

00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,300
program I've been able to accomplish

00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:59,970
that at a very reasonable rate and yeah

00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,550
it's just the the progression is has

00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:04,050
been very exciting so far and I'm

00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:12,690
looking forward to it more to come so

00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:16,170
yeah yeah no I'm actually partaking in a

00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:18,930
partaking in what's it called the code

00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,310
for how they at Scott's yeah I'm also

00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,650
looking forward to that because it'll be

00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:24,420
a first time for me and also I get into

00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,030
know more about the people who were in

00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:29,160
there and like how to contribute as well

00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,230
so looking forward to it yeah thanks for

00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:37,010
listening

00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:37,010
[Applause]

00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:42,200
all right it's a high similar to Joseph

00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,600
wait I should introduce myself first

00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,400
my name is Yasmine similar to Joseph I

00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,060
was introduced to Drupal through Genesis

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,560
works because of Genesis works I became

00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,880
more interested in technology and

00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,890
computer science I'm currently a

00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,310
computer science major in Chicago and so

00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:02,900
one of the most important things for me

00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,490
going into this deciding like oh I

00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,770
wanted to major in computer science is

00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:08,540
that I wanted to explore the different

00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,310
venues because I know the term itself

00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,880
computer science is so vague and there's

00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:15,710
so many different branches of it so when

00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,510
this opportunity came up to learn about

00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,700
Drupal which is like you know web

00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,570
development and can do so much more than

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,420
that

00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:27,320
I jumped at it because it seemed like a

00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:29,060
good route to learn more and that's

00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,060
something that I really wanted to take

00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,140
advantage of you know I've heard from a

00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,340
lot of people that they wish that

00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,290
they've heard about Drupal when they

00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,960
were younger like they were trained at

00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:40,490
an earlier age or like they they really

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,750
want these kinds of experiences when

00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,760
they're younger because they really

00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,430
appreciate it now and I'm very grateful

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,410
to have you know been part of this along

00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,390
with the other the other students that

00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,360
I'm with and what's your website Yasmin

00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:57,380
oh so my website is a passion project

00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,790
for mariachi so I've been playing

00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,220
mariachi music since I was like nine

00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:04,280
years old and so I'm currently a mentor

00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,660
at an organization in Chicago and so I

00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,830
wanted to come up with an idea of

00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,330
something that you know they could

00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,850
showcase

00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:16,940
other talented students in the Chicago

00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:18,890
area and she told us she told us she

00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:20,090
went to a mariachi conference and I'm

00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:23,570
dying to see what that looks like

00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:25,960
wondering do any of the other students

00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,960
want to share

00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:37,099
when everyone um Justin Lang from

00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:38,900
empower and Baltimore um pretty much my

00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:41,359
first appearances at Juba Colin 2017 in

00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,820
Baltimore um pretty much is like give

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:46,160
him a peek way honestly like it turns us

00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,840
women like you step in the water it was

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,619
like not much I learned about Drupal at

00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:53,690
2017 dribble conscious the first dose of

00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:55,880
it but so far through the initiative

00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,680
program I learned more about it it

00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,270
sounds like it's women actually you know

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,680
actually getting your first stroke in

00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:02,830
the water swimming learn more about

00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,780
Drupal me I want to learn more about it

00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:06,349
Thunder say more but as much as I can

00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,869
about it

00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:11,750
maybe know brought my roses Fuhrman

00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:14,060
Drupal for me my own passion is like you

00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:18,369
know never technology ever degree in it

00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:20,710
from tuna collarbone wet County Essex um

00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:23,570
actually I learn more about it

00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:25,040
maybe like I'm not gonna deal with it

00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,900
with techno

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,530
be my first personal project for my

00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:33,140
website is a tech help website I mean a

00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:34,820
family to call me the IT support the

00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,080
rest economy for like tech problems

00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,450
they're like something with like a virus

00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:41,150
something helping out with it kind of

00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:50,660
get rid of it so that's pretty much my

00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:52,580
project so we only have a few minutes

00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,960
left to take questions but we're happy

00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,400
to hang out in the lobby and take as

00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,200
many questions as you want but I do want

00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,780
to say that we are continuing the

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,240
conversation we're having a buff at 2:15

00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:05,089
inclusion in action and then also Julia

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,250
from Genesis works was very generously

00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:08,300
willing to host her own ba for the first

00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,339
time even though she's never been to

00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,410
Drupal con before just talking about how

00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:15,260
you can partner with nonprofits to reach

00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:18,760
diverse audiences so thank you very much

00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,760
questions I'm sure there are many

00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:31,650
yeah because they're recording okay so

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:34,320
um I want to talk a little bit about

00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:35,520
your experiences with measurement I'm

00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,500
just because I run a very similar

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,780
internship program as you do that it's

00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,310
ending its second cycle in May and I

00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,280
want to implement more of the resource

00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:45,869
component for my students as well but I

00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,550
require that all students apply for

00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:49,560
experiential course credit their local

00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,780
universities and that really helps with

00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,430
the measurement component because

00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,780
there's fixed parameters in which they

00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,880
have to meet to get the university

00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,500
credit requirement as well as an hour

00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,150
requirement so even if it's not all

00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,010
in-person work they have to document

00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,600
that and track it so it's really helped

00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:06,840
for me in terms of the parameters to

00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,670
evaluate them on and then in the end of

00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,590
the internship they have to do a final

00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,450
presentation in person or virtual their

00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,220
choice but it's a presentation of a

00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,570
final brand package including their

00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,030
website so it's basically like a

00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:19,770
business pitch and that is a great point

00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:23,340
that I can evaluate their full like

00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:24,450
scope of work on but speaking to those I

00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,369
just didn't know if you had any more

00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:28,410
specific measurement points that you

00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:31,590
were looking to implement or that you

00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:33,240
did try and maybe didn't work out so I

00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,400
would say that we were considering using

00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,109
a survey to measure kind of students

00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,609
understanding and comprehension of core

00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:39,990
concepts like in the in the middle of

00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:41,280
the program but a question I have for

00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:43,500
you is that not all of our students are

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,390
enrolled in a university so what would

00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,260
you recommend in that contact context I

00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,359
think field I feel like your

00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,940
presentation idea is spot-on and then

00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:53,010
also the our requirement I think that

00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,390
makes sense to you I think because we

00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:56,190
have some students who are watching

00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:59,040
recordings it might be hard to measure

00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:00,780
you know that as well and so that would

00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,760
be self reporting but I'm curious if you

00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,920
don't if our cohort is kind of a mixture

00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,390
of some folks are in college and some

00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,220
folks aren't what would you recommend

00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:10,080
for this folks who are not in college I

00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,550
think you could implement the same kind

00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,050
of measurement system that Career

00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,250
Center's use at universities because

00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,140
they have those parameters pretty

00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,780
publicly available so you could use the

00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,340
same tools and resources to track their

00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,890
experiences and measure them the same

00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,840
way but if you are looking towards

00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,950
expanding and getting scholarships these

00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,840
experience will credit hours at most

00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:29,010
universities usually aren't incredibly

00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,890
expensive depending on if they're in

00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,870
state and have

00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,520
local residents so it's something you

00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,600
can maybe offer a scholarship for at

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,850
some point to where they could get

00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:46,510
academic credit for it okay great thank

00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:49,120
you I just wonder if you can talk a

00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:51,280
little bit more about Genesis works and

00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,470
npower like what they what the

00:54:51,280 --> 00:55:07,720
organization's do and just a little bit

00:54:53,470 --> 00:55:10,390
more about that yeah right so my name is

00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,850
Julia Logan I work at Genesis works we

00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:15,250
are a workforce development non-profit

00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:17,290
so we were founded in Houston 16 years

00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:20,500
ago and we've expanded to five other

00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:23,770
cities that Alison and Michelle had up

00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,420
there so the core program our students

00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:27,880
get training this summer before their

00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,620
senior year of high school and they in

00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,920
Chicago they receive training at their

00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:34,930
IT or accounting in Houston they also

00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,700
have some engineering as well because of

00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:38,260
the clients they have based in in

00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:42,400
Houston and the folks that they work

00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:44,830
with there so it's 160 hours of really

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,020
rigorous robust training they get half

00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:49,180
of that in their IT or accounting and

00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,770
then the other half is in business

00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,770
professional skills so how to do

00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:55,930
impromptu public speaking how to write

00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:57,790
professional emails how to engage with

00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,620
colleagues in the workplace and then

00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:01,180
once they've successfully completed

00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,560
their summer training they are placed in

00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,690
internships for their senior year of

00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,310
high school this is true for across all

00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,660
sites so they go to school in the

00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,830
morning of their senior year and then

00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,880
they work from 1:00 to 5:00 Monday

00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:12,580
through Friday

00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,700
they are Yasmin was worked at the IT

00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:18,550
Help Desk at Accenture Joseph worked in

00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:21,430
IT Help Desk at Spencer Stewart Willie

00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:25,480
gofer you interned Malik interned at

00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:27,130
TransUnion Natasha was at Kirkland and

00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,230
Ellis which is a huge law firm and she

00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:32,080
was a person who sent phishing emails

00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:34,630
and then would send you a don't get

00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,730
fished when they got fish response email

00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:39,400
so she worked with the securities team

00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:40,840
and so they have really my kind of

00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,550
giving those examples they have really

00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,150
meaningful robust internships it's not

00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,400
making

00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:48,010
see and you know fetching coffee and

00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,290
making copies and then my role is we

00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:51,970
continue to provide support for six

00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,160
years out of high school so from

00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,930
eighteen to twenty-four I work with our

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,610
students on college and career success

00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,900
so if they're starting in a two-year

00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,580
school helping them transfer to a

00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:03,360
four-year school getting our

00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,230
certificates are working right away our

00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,900
organization's mission is that our

00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,730
students gain economic self-sufficiency

00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,750
so that looks like a lot of different

00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,850
ways for our students it's not

00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,440
necessarily a four-year degree so we

00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:18,070
kind of see a lot of different paths to

00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:21,070
to economic success and so that's kind

00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:23,080
of the overall synopsis of who we are

00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,390
Joseph's works and I'm just gonna invite

00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:27,880
Justin to really quickly if you can come

00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:29,260
up and chat a little bit about empower

00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,790
that would be great and then we have to

00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,560
actually close unfortunately because

00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:36,790
there's another session that's coming in

00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:40,260
here organization to much to help

00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:43,030
undeveloped use pretty much 18 to 24

00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,950
give them technology skills to

00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,260
officially attain to conte a plus

00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:48,970
certification for me personally I had

00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,700
like a strong technical background

00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:53,710
friends from high school in the college

00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:56,650
as well so pretty much it was like a

00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,850
refresher course for me for empower and

00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:02,280
it kind of helped me attain my CompTIA

00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:04,750
A+ certification pretty much cost-free

00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,300
yes they're doing internship placements

00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:17,560
and eventually helping you take a job as

00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:18,580
well so thank you everyone for your time

00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,770
if you want to continue the conversation

00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,420
like Allison said we'll be outside for

00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:26,910
the next five to 10 minutes or so but

00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:31,300
then we'll also have the Boff in room

00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:33,430
203 be from 2:15 to 3:15 so if you're

00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,220
about to jet into another session you

00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:37,530
can always catch us there as well thank

00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:42,799
you thank you everyone

00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:42,799
