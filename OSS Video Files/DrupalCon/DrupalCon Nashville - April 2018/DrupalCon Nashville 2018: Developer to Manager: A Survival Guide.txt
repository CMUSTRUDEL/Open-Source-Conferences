Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Developer to Manager: A Survival Guide
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Good work leads to promotions -- and promotions from development to management come with more than increases in responsibility. While they're often awarded based on mastery of one skill set, they require you to learn a whole new one. Plus, the methods you've previously used for learning new skills might fail you -- this learning curve would be a lot easier if you could just googleÂ "drush commands for management" until you found some results.

During this session, I'll talk about adjusting from life as a developer to life as a manager, including:

Avoiding the pacesetting leader trap.
Giving performance feedback that goes beyond code reviews.
Giving room to make mistakes (while mitigating the big risks).
Communicating like a team leader, not a team member.
Investing time in people, not projects.

This session is targeted toward new managers and developers considering management, by a former developer who made the leap and loved it.

all right we're gonna get started hi

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,810
everybody welcome to developer to

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,030
manager a Survival Guide

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,800
this presentation is targeted at people

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,990
who are currently developers and are

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,429
becoming new managers either because

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,710
they've recently been promoted or

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,020
because they're considering becoming

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,060
managers in the near future if you are

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,740
looking for a more challenging

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,240
management topic like you know doing a

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,430
team turnaround with a team that is

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,019
struggling or scaling a team over time

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,970
this is not the right talk for you

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,650
because it is aimed at that first moment

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,700
when you like ramped up and take on

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:42,210
those new opportunities and

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:45,090
responsibilities so first him first a

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,950
little bit about me my name is Kat cool

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,710
I am the director of solutions

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,600
Consulting @ ffw before that I was the

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,520
director of technology at chief an

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,140
agency in DC if you've got questions

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,670
about the presentation or if you just

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,530
want to talk about it because I love

00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,969
nerding out about this topic you can

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,239
find me at webby cat basically

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,519
everywhere twitter drupal.org the drupal

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,530
slack you name it

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,420
so i started coding when i was about 12

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,570
years old like a totally well-adjusted

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,010
middle schooler would totally do I've

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,409
been working professionally in this

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,420
industry for about 10 years initially as

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,299
a developer then as a project manager

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,150
took a brief break to find myself as an

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,970
English teacher in South Korea and then

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,170
I came back to being a developer I got

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,329
promoted to being a director about 2014

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,590
actually like the week of that DrupalCon

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:40,229
in 2014 and I went from managing a small

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,210
team of developers to over time managing

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,070
a much larger team we went from about

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,920
seven people when I became to director

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,729
at chief to 28 people by the time I left

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,009
and went to ffw so in that time I worked

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,840
with a lot of new managers after

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,130
initially being a new manager myself and

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,750
the advice that I'll give you in this

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,280
talk is a lot of the same advice I gave

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:05,880
them so if you have just moved into

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,079
management or you are considering moving

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,580
into management by the way there are

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,420
seats up front if you want to be those

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,420
people who sit in the front

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,480
if you just moved into this you might be

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,570
feeling a little bit nervous you might

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,250
be a bit unnerved by the prospect of

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,130
having people's careers and livelihoods

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,200
and whether they get promoted directly

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,850
in your hands you might be wondering if

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,950
you'll do a good job with that very

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,900
different kind of responsibility and you

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,180
might be wondering how you're gonna

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,280
handle it the first time you hear people

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,210
complain about the boss and you remember

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,770
that the boss is you so if you do have

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,930
these feelings you might be a little bit

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,240
like me because this is a dramatic

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,010
reenactment of my reaction to getting

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,920
told that I was going to be becoming

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,320
director about six months sooner than we

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,750
had been planning on a lot of people

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,300
jockey for this promotion I did not

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,520
jockey for it and in fact I was actively

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,620
terrified of it because I knew what a

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,310
giant responsibility it was and I didn't

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,100
want to screw it up so new managers

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,959
faced a lot of pretty unique struggles

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,430
first of all when you get promoted you

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,950
might feel like you are expected to have

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:23,090
all the answers and unfortunately you

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:26,060
kind of are because like in our industry

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,459
this is not like a gigantic industry of

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,410
a massive companies usually there's not

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,120
usually orientation for becoming a

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,160
manager there's not usually a talk where

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,370
the HR person sits you down and explains

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,170
to you how it works usually the type of

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,360
training you get to do this is entirely

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,700
dependent on how seriously your manager

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,380
takes it so if your manager wants to

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,300
talk to you about like establishing

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,640
healthy boundaries with your team or

00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,250
what sort of management Styles work and

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,290
what don't or the terrifying prospect of

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,400
giving your first performance review

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,489
Congrats like you actually get some

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,070
training but more often managers tell

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,390
you set up some one-on-ones give them

00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,830
some feedback it'll be fine don't worry

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,200
about it

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,600
oversight is also pretty limited because

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,910
managers who don't take that initial

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,890
training part seriously often also don't

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,080
take checking in to see how it's going

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,459
seriously they don't come to you and say

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,500
hey how are you doing what are you

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,870
struggling with and they also don't go

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,300
to your direct reports and ask hey how's

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,860
Kat doing they mostly assume that if

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,080
nothing goes wrong then it's all

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,449
be fine but just because you've got

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,009
limited training and limited oversight

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,169
it does not mean you have limited

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,729
responsibility because your boss is

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,289
still going to expect you to be able to

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,599
report on how your team is doing and

00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,939
your team for some reason is still gonna

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:42,050
want guidance from you so you have to

00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,229
figure it out pretty quickly and you

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,979
have to figure it out on the job so if

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:51,289
you do have a manager who's interested

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,000
in this or a mentor or a friendly HR

00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:55,129
person who wants to take you under their

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,990
wing they might talk to you about two

00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,930
major types of challenges you have to

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,120
overcome early and the first is learning

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,250
how to communicate like a leader rather

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,110
than like a team member and the second

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,340
is shifting your focus from developing

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,490
code to developing people so first let's

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,199
talk about communicating like a leader

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,479
up until this point you have been a

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,979
member of a team you're probably a

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,050
pretty critical part of your team

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,550
realistically if you're considering

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,289
moving into management or have been

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,210
promoted you might have even been

00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:29,000
mentoring the people around you either

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,190
formally or informally and to be

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,599
successful in this management role you

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,129
have to accept that your communication

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,509
style is going to need to change and

00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:38,419
your relationships are gonna need to

00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:40,300
change there is no magic bullet for

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,860
getting the promotion getting the raise

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,050
and then still relating the same way to

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,639
the people around you so the sooner you

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,289
think about how you want to change these

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,940
relationships and what you want them to

00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:53,210
become the better off you're going to be

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:57,080
in your new management role as a

00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:00,199
developer your team relationships tend

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,969
to be very collaboration based you are

00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,949
all in this together like you might be

00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,659
the most senior front-end developer on

00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,310
your team but you might be working with

00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:09,620
another junior front-end developer

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,360
back-end developer project manager a

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,719
designer and you're all pulling together

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,089
to get the work done collaboratively if

00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:18,680
you have input on what people are doing

00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,539
wrong you're probably giving that

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,919
feedback pretty indirectly if you are

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,509
not the manager you don't walk up to

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,210
someone and be like look I need you to

00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,400
change how you're doing this instead you

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,080
say hey it would really help me out if

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,330
you would think about maybe doing this

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,759
instead or if the problem is really

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,589
severe you might go to their manager and

00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,760
talk to them about what a person needs

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:40,730
to do differently

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,010
and finally those big-picture process

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,080
problems on the team are the managers

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,570
responsibility even if you as a

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,800
developer are providing input on what

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,570
could be done differently and how the

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,930
team could evolve the manager is

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,580
ultimately accountable for it but all of

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,130
this changes when you become a manager

00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,810
first of all your relationships become

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,550
based on your authority you are

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,660
representing the bottom line you are

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,340
representing the company's performance

00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,550
and you are answerable for the team's

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,470
work your feedback becomes very direct

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,330
now you do have to walk up to people and

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,950
say look I need you to handle this

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,800
differently and you need to be very

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,480
direct about it and thirdly there's

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,910
process problems are still manager

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,750
issues but now you're the manager so

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,760
that's fun so as a manager you get a lot

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,790
of control over how the team works and

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,890
this is really exciting you get to fix

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,810
problems at the business level rather

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,640
than at the code level and if you are a

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,610
certain kind of manager certain kind of

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,410
brain this is really rewarding for you

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,360
ultimately teams need people that are

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,980
willing to say I know we've been doing

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,360
it like this for a long time but it's

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,890
not working and we're not competitive

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,080
anymore so we have to start doing

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,000
something new and they need people who

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,130
are willing to tell them I know you want

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,750
this promotion but in order to get it I

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,460
need you to do these concrete things

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,870
over the next six months to a year so

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,310
giving those messages successfully

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,810
relies on developing different

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,790
communication skills than the ones that

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,320
you had as a developer or is another

00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,020
type of practitioner though I'm gonna

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,370
focus on developers just want to know

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,400
and you need to find new ways of

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:17,140
communicating and giving those messages

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,520
so first of all I like to set the stage

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,560
both when I became the new manager and

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,630
now when I take on new individual direct

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,100
reports with a transitional one-on-one

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,770
that goes pretty in-depth about how

00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,170
we're gonna work together this like

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,790
helps you turn subtext into text because

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,530
we all come into those new management

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,210
relationships with these assumptions

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,710
about how we're gonna work together and

00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,810
what the other person needs and they're

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:42,110
often like dead wrong speaking from

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:45,110
experience so I divide the transitional

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,330
one-on-one into two distinct parts where

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,250
first of all you talk about your vision

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,880
for the team and how you think the team

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,880
needs to operate

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,200
and then secondly you talk about what

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,830
you both need from each other as a

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,120
manager and as direct report so if

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,040
you've been part of the team for a while

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,690
you probably have a sense of what it's

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,310
really struggling with and what it's

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,360
really doing well and this is your

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,700
chance to bring that to the forefront

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,100
and say you know as we work together I

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,470
really want to make sure that we are

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,850
improving our code review process like

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,310
right now it's sort of week and it's a

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,620
priority for me to make this stronger or

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,090
to say right now we're really struggling

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,770
with this concrete part of Drupal

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,420
development and our processes keep going

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,420
off the rails so I want to put a lot of

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,310
focus here these next two questions are

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,230
like my favorite part of any

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,240
transitional one-on-one because you can

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,900
see people breathe an actual sigh of

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,340
relief when you start talking about them

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,140
talking about what kind of management

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,750
styles make you more successful and less

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,590
successful who here has had a manager

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:49,290
they really hated okay who's had a

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,550
manager they really loved okay it's

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,300
really interesting people loved is more

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,160
than two hated in this group if you had

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,170
managers that she really didn't like the

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,760
odds are that you know why but there's a

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,830
particular part of their style that just

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,030
flatly did not work for you and if

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,680
you've had managers that she really

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,540
loved who could unlock the best in you

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,910
the odds are that you've taken note of

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,970
what they did that you want other people

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,410
to do as well so when these you give you

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,050
the team permission to tell you about

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,250
them most people tell me that they hate

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,980
being micromanaged

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,600
they hate constant check-ins but every

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,220
once in a while someone will tell me I

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,680
want to be able to bounce things off you

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,240
regularly like I'm I'm struggling with

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,250
this and it's really important to me to

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,410
have your ear and to feel like if I IMU

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,390
and say hey can I talk this out you're

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,060
actually going to be okay with that well

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,730
similarly you know some people will talk

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,410
about how the most important thing to

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,060
them is the ability to have ongoing

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,770
advancement and to know where they

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,180
really are and other people are really

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,440
happy where they're at like they just

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,600
want to come to work and keep doing what

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,280
they're doing so the part two of this is

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,400
talking about what motivates them and

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,560
what their goals are so your job as a

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,450
manager is to get the best out of every

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,520
person that you work with and this is a

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,500
lot easier to do if you know what they

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,910
consider their best to be

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,430
if there are particular parts of their

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,840
job that they really love parts of their

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,100
roles that other companies that they

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,080
really loved that they're not getting

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,550
here bringing that to the forefront

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:20,160
gives you an opportunity to correct

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:21,990
around it and the talking about their

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,940
long-term goals and where they want to

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,500
be as their career advances and even

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,570
putting a timetable to it which some

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,310
people have give you a sense of what

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,040
they expect and how you need to help

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,040
them move forward and finally I strongly

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,660
recommend leaving some extra time to

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,310
talk about something off script like a

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,290
question that you you know are not

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,760
coming to you with an agenda just asking

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,440
what is the most important thing you

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,740
think I should know about you right now

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,360
so I've gotten things ranging from you

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,950
know I just had a new baby and I'm

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,660
struggling with my hours so I'm working

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,660
kind of an unconventional schedule but

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm still completely putting in my time

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,790
to you know I really am looking to move

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,140
up in the next few months I know where I

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,790
want to get and I've been struggling to

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,220
get there so I really want you to tell

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,230
me what I need to do differently to

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,870
people who are concerned about working

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,060
together in a new role because we had a

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,260
relationship as peers before and they're

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,170
concerned about how to make that jump

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,270
because you know too much about them so

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,710
that's how I approach transitional

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,150
one-on-ones and I can say that while

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,010
they you often feel like they're gonna

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,390
be awkward and you're following a script

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,600
and you're literally like reading a list

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,220
of questions this is the most like the

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,080
most satisfying way to start out a new

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,280
relationship because you're not going

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,420
into it with assumptions like you're

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,100
afraid of what the other person thinks

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,980
you're giving them the opportunity to

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,450
get it on the table and then you are

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:44,370
orienting around that so secondly I

00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,230
would highly recommend learning how to

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,740
use multiple leadership styles and

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,140
multiple communication styles you might

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,880
naturally be a highly Democratic leader

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,860
who sees a challenge come up and then

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,270
says hey guys this challenge is facing

00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,850
us how are we gonna band together as a

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,950
team to overcome it you might be what's

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,900
called a paced setting leader where you

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,430
set super high standards and you say

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,110
this is the pace we're gonna follow like

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,930
let's all get behind it and make it work

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:13,110
you might be a coaching leader these

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,120
styles are taken from an article an

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,980
article taken from a study called

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,939
leadership gets results by Daniel

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,549
Goleman

00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:22,279
it was from the year 2000 which is the

00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:25,829
throwback but management is one of those

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,509
fields that a little easier to take

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:31,319
lessons from the year 2000 than it is

00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:33,659
and say development and that they

00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:35,069
studied about 4,000 executives and they

00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,139
took notes on the sorts of leadership

00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:38,849
styles that they showed world it down to

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,119
six styles and then noted the effects

00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:43,709
that all of these had on the team and

00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:46,829
the six Styles that they identified were

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:50,069
these first of all highly affiliative

00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,809
leaders they care about people they are

00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:53,339
the people who will say like we need to

00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,379
build strong relationships on this team

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,909
I see you guys working late I can't

00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,139
necessarily do what you do but I'm gonna

00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,839
order a pizza and I'm gonna stay with

00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,459
you while you do it they often struggle

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,409
to give really negative feedback to

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,229
their teams but they build crazy loyal

00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:09,839
teams because the team's genuinely feel

00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:12,329
like they have their backs authoritative

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,889
leaders lay out this vision and then

00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,689
they say come with me here's how we're

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,599
going to achieve it and they motivate

00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:20,699
people toward a shared common goal they

00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:22,649
have a unique ability to figure out what

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,569
organizations need to do in order to

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:27,119
adapt and change and then to motivate

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:28,499
people to come with them and coaching

00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:31,379
leaders are focused on developing

00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:32,939
individuals so they like help you figure

00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,709
out how to overcome your weaknesses and

00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:37,409
how to deepen your strengths and they

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,939
work really well when people like know

00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,470
that they need to improve and are game

00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:42,059
for doing that and it really doesn't

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,989
work if people don't want to change or

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,409
if they're like I'm doing good enough

00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:47,789
what are you talking about

00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:50,069
coercive leaders lead through giving

00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:52,529
orders they show up and they say do it

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:54,569
and expect you to do it and if you don't

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,459
then you can often have a challenge this

00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:58,319
style works really well when a team is

00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:59,549
in crisis and they need to turn around

00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:00,720
because they're doing something that's

00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:03,209
been really wrong and really

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,129
unproductive or unprofitable but in the

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,349
long run it really squelches teams it

00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,869
like shoves down creative thinking and

00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:11,189
it can really be problematic we've

00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,839
talked about Democratic leaders a little

00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:16,769
bit so I'm not gonna belabor it too much

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,149
but they this style can lead to endless

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,709
meetings and people feeling really

00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,729
rudderless because every time something

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,389
comes up they're like guys let's get a

00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:25,619
conference room and talk about this and

00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:27,290
we've we've all been in like the to our

00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:32,600
meetings right

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:34,370
and finally I can hear that we have pace

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,680
setting leaders are the do as I do type

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,810
they are often promoted because they are

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,220
really good at their jobs they show up

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,639
and they expect everybody else to be as

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,949
good as they are so in this article

00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,389
Golemon argued that we misjudge

00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,399
leadership styles when we think about

00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,259
them as a function of personality so I

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,750
really like people therefore I'm an

00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,370
affiliate of leader instead he says that

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,860
we should see them as strategic choices

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,040
and pick the right leadership style for

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,709
different situations so a lot of people

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,300
do lead on just one style but if you can

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,829
figure out how to trot out other styles

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,649
when they're needed you deepen it a lot

00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:11,209
so a highly Democratic leader who sees

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,620
her team struggling should be able to

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,180
lay out of the vision of an

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,709
authoritative leader and say let's work

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,050
together to make this happen and

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,579
delegate tasks actively rather than

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,730
waiting for people to pick them up like

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,649
tasks at a scrum meeting a naturally

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,149
coaching oriented leader who's dealing

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,190
with a recalcitrant employee who is not

00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,350
listening to feedback should be able to

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,579
become more coercive and say I need you

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,240
to do this if we're gonna be successful

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:37,160
here working together so what I would

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,079
tend to advise is figuring out what

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,639
comes easiest to you like which of these

00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,529
Styles really resonated with you

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,690
thinking about how to get better at that

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:47,300
sure but then focusing on the other part

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,149
like I naturally am super into coaching

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,709
I love coaching people I'm also a bit of

00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,819
a paste setting leader so I'm glad I

00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,470
read this article early in my career

00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:59,810
because it talked about how it can crush

00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:01,310
a team with awkward so both of these are

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,260
focused on raising the standards of how

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,939
people work together but both of them

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,130
can really struggle under certain

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,809
conditions so I had to consciously work

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,370
on my ability to lay out a vision and

00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,740
motivate people toward it and I had to

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,150
consciously work on my ability to be a

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,429
bit more coercive when people's

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,750
performance was failing and give them

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,480
very direct feedback that we'll talk

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,010
about a minute so when I started trying

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,809
to pick up these other styles I wasn't

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,699
as good at I would spend a lot more time

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,220
writing out my thoughts and really

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,990
preparing for meetings beforehand even

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,159
role-playing with mentors and managers

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,179
that I trusted and this ultimately

00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:37,610
prepared me to be able to switch between

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:40,210
them when I needed to and more crisis

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,230
situations later in my career

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,850
and finally the next part of really

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,390
improving your communication is figuring

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,010
out how to have the deeper conversations

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,049
Ricci managers are often really nervous

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,309
about getting vulnerable they're nervous

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:56,559
about hearing something that they're not

00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,840
expecting so as a result they sort of

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,730
skip past this whole level that people

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,140
just really need from them so if you're

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,840
asking hey how's it going and someone

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,909
says it's going fine yeah it's been a

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,380
good week and you let that go like you

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,309
have no business being disappointed when

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,049
they quit later and you weren't

00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,090
expecting it you have to find a way to

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,010
dig into what people aren't saying and

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,890
force those conversations a level deeper

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,110
than the standard project day-to-day so

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,539
there are three ways that I like to do

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,340
this and the first is setting aside one

00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,679
meeting a month to talk about people's

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:30,010
goals and their progress from their

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:33,250
weekly one-on-one so after I do reviews

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:35,110
and set up goals and feedback for people

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,640
I check in once a month to see how it's

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,200
going and give them an opportunity to

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,649
talk to me about more big picture things

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,760
that have come up for them I also

00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:44,649
encourage people to talk about what

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,809
they're really proud of rather than just

00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:48,039
the day-to-day because we naturally come

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,210
to our managers when something's wrong

00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:53,799
right we come to them because we need

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,779
intervention or we need reassurance and

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,100
that can mean that every time someone

00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,000
comes into your office they're talking

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,190
about something that they're struggling

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,049
with and it can mean that you wind up

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,940
losing the ability to really see what

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:06,070
they're good at and what is motivating

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,260
and what situations they shine in so

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,279
setting aside time and telling me I want

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,169
you to tell me about something that

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,600
you're proud of it

00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:15,549
it gets better results in the long run

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,970
and keeps that conversation focused on

00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:22,149
what is motivating not just what is

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,500
problematic so finally if your employees

00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,600
are really unhappy like just don't run

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,620
from these conversations they are really

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,460
really important so I tend to set up

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,190
conversations after really tough

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,870
projects to talk about what went wrong

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,630
and what people can do differently in

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,700
the future when I'm not part of the

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,649
project this has like no emotional

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,289
impact for me when I am part of the

00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:48,760
project it is a little worse I had I am

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,980
the kind of person who is like a

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,230
textbook overachiever like psychotic

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,960
perfectionist so I can tell you the

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,120
first time I got

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,000
be in school I can tell you the first

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,370
talk I gave that bombed negative

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,720
feedback just days burned into my brain

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,500
and a lot of rookie managers are like

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,299
this they start like dreading that

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,740
negative feedback and running from it

00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,100
and in the process they become really

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,390
brittle and fragile and then they fail

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,130
alternatively they can decide to

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,799
confront their mistakes head-on learn

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:21,980
from them and adopt them so on my

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,350
toughest project I was managing three

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,210
people three developers and I was also

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,130
the person who was the team lead I was

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:32,809
overseeing the project work and the

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:35,149
client made a bunch of requests as

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,429
clients do and scope started getting

00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:39,080
sort of out of hand so scope was not my

00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,730
something that I could directly control

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,100
but it was something that really

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,169
overtaxed the team so the team started

00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,370
burning out and then when the project

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,840
launched I was like awesome we got

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,220
through it we're all gonna move on we're

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,890
gonna forget about this it's gonna be

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,149
great but the reality was that these

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,049
three people were still pretty

00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:59,029
demotivated and they were still it

00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,409
didn't feel great about starting new

00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,370
projects and we're sort of afraid the

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:05,390
same thing would happen again

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,830
so I steeled myself I set up a meeting

00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,140
to talk with them about what worked and

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,760
what didn't work and I listened it

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,559
sucked

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,929
most of their feedback was about the

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,450
project but some of it expressed really

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:20,240
like respectfully and they it was great

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,500
was about me and how there were ways in

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,110
which they felt like I hadn't protected

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,520
them effectively or I had talked about

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,870
the project in ways that made it a

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,539
little harder for them to do their job

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,789
and like veered to positive when I

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,840
should have had that like okay this

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,289
sucks but we're all gonna get through it

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,820
together sort of tone so if I hadn't had

00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,529
that conversation I wouldn't have

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,360
learned anything about how these

00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:43,279
particular tics that I had affected

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,409
their to my team and also these people

00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,809
might not have recovered as it was they

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:49,789
all like we all rallied we got through

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:51,559
it we did a second phase with that

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:54,350
client and then we moved on and they're

00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,000
still at the company now so I would

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,220
heart I would strongly recommend that

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,750
you do dig deeper and get comfortable

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,669
hearing feedback that you don't love

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,880
because it makes you much stronger and

00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:06,919
much better as a manager in the long run

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,700
so to recap communicating like a leader

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,110
by

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,210
setting up transitional one-on-ones

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,830
learning to use multiple leadership

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,660
styles and having these deeper

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,030
conversations will really take you a

00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,040
long way in in changing your

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,800
communication from a developer style to

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,330
a manager style but that second

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,800
challenge is starting to develop people

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:29,450
not developing code so the bad news

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,030
about developing people is that they're

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,430
super buggy they have a lot of variable

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,620
they do not do what she wants you cannot

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,440
Google drush commands for them it's it's

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,000
terrible the good news is that if you

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,710
have a certain kind of brain seeing

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,210
people grow over time is a lot more

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:49,010
rewarding than seeing functionality grow

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:51,260
over time so as you become a leader in

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,970
this way you no longer get judged quite

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,010
as much by the quality of the solution

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,740
that you put together that you put

00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,120
together together you get judged instead

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,030
by the quality of the team that you

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,460
build over time so you get judged by

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,380
whether they are doing good work whether

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,850
they are growing individually they're

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,100
better off now than they were a year ago

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,350
whether they are sticking around like if

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:18,680
your whole team quits it's like usually

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:20,300
bad if they as a unit are able to take

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,520
on like harder and more lucrative

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,140
projects overtime this is a really

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,690
different set of metrics then does it

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,700
work and is the client happy so you have

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,100
to really think about how you want to

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,900
position yourself to get these results

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,820
and the two things I'll talk to you

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,880
about are delegating and giving really

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,860
constructive feedback if you've been

00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,390
promoted to a management role from a

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,760
development one it was probably because

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,550
you were really good at what you did

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,860
probably because you were a solid

00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,780
developer even a senior developer and

00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,250
you are probably pretty undaunted by

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,800
challenges that can really mess with

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,240
other people's heads so promotion into a

00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,280
leadership role in some ways it's the

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,760
ultimate recognition of your abilities

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,200
here but as Carol Walker's article on

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,810
saving rookie managers from themselves

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,160
there's a catchy title right covers they

00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,380
managers often fail to grasp that this

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,150
is no longer about how good they are it

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,250
is now about how good the people that

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,170
they work with are and they stop looking

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,940
for they should stop looking for these

00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,350
opportunities for personal achievement

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,570
and start looking for the opportunities

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,270
for

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,210
other people to achieve so as your scope

00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,740
expands you become responsible

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,120
indirectly for a lot more things so if

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,710
you're managing three people and they're

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,210
on two projects all of a sudden you're

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,330
indirectly responsible for six more

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:38,250
projects or if you are picking up people

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,690
who are more responsible for other

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,640
avenues of the same projects you're

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,320
working on you're now responsible for

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,090
more parts of that project and it's

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,620
really easy to say like I mean I know

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,850
this person's struggling so I'm just

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,710
gonna tell them how to do it or I'm just

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,080
gonna do it myself rather than waiting

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,220
for him to screw it up and there are a

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,560
couple of different reasons why you

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,960
might like wind up not delegating and

00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,710
instead keeping this work for yourself

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,090
first he's had it

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,740
we've covered this you're good developer

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,860
you want to keep doing good development

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,140
work the second is feeling like you need

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,420
to perform tasks to demonstrate your

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,740
value to your manager especially if you

00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,900
are struggling with a new management

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,280
role you might want to work on this

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,390
really cool project that has a lot of

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,440
visibility and get the credit for it

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,140
third is what I like to call the group

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,100
project syndrome you are afraid that if

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,180
you give work to the people on your team

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,040
looking for a diplomatic way to say this

00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,700
they're gonna screw it up and then

00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,940
you're gonna get blamed so instead you

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,680
know you wind up acting like you did

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,060
possibly on a group project in high

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,410
school in college where you just keep

00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,430
the really challenging stuff so you

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,080
don't have to worry about them not

00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,210
having it done at the eleventh hour and

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,490
finally the one that I struggle with the

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,900
most personally you see that the team is

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,770
already overburdened and you don't want

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,870
to give them more work than they can

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,480
handle so you wind up burning yourself

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,920
out and running yourself into a hole so

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,810
that nobody else has to burn themselves

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,630
out and run themselves into a hole I

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,190
think you wind up asking yourself what

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,780
was a weekend and why am I not having

00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,940
them anymore

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,100
why is the janitor always leaving the

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,960
building before I am this is based on

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,250
true story so other than your sanity

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,750
there are some compelling reasons to

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,780
push through this and figure out how to

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:21,720
delegate and delegate well it helps each

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,550
member of your team grow it increases

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,860
their job satisfaction to feel needed

00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,330
and valued like if you only get the easy

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,910
assignments and someone else keeps the

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,230
hard ones it's not hard math to realize

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,360
you're not value and that you're not

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,920
trusted and if someone is giving you

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,280
those challenging pieces and trusting

00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,020
you to run

00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,580
with it in the long run you feel much

00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,950
more like a vital part of this company

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,600
so those two things together lead to

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,860
more retention which is good because

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,410
then you don't have to retrain a bunch

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,750
of people and that scales the work that

00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,400
your team can do over time giving them

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,640
room to expand beyond just what you can

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,470
micromanage and instead act

00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,520
independently and take on more than you

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,060
ever could have been involved with

00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,910
yourself so these are all good reasons

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,230
to retrain your brain from all I'll just

00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,330
it's got to get done right so I'm just

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,460
gonna do it - that sounds like an

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,440
awesome opportunity for Alice like she's

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,670
been you know these projects convinced

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,710
me that she's gonna do well with this

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,840
task so I'm gonna let her run with it

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,310
and you know give her this opportunity

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,270
to achieve rather than taking it for

00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:23,580
myself but if you want to do this but

00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,350
you're still saying hey cat like that's

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,930
that's really great and practice theory

00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:30,210
but in practice my team can't handle the

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,630
same kinds of tasks that I can this is

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,770
what I recommend for delegating

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,710
responsibilities without just delegating

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,330
like any insight into the project you do

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:41,670
have to start out by delegating this is

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,680
not negotiable just do it

00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,870
you then have to set milestones for

00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,340
check-ins so for some tasks this might

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,060
be once it's completely done and you're

00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,980
ready to release it to prod four other

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,390
four other tasks it might be once you've

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,650
met with a client I want you to come

00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,480
back and talk to me about how you're

00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,580
planning to address it and for others it

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,410
might just be partway through but at

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,970
those check-ins you need to meet with

00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,340
your team members and have them present

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,020
their work to you rather than you like

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,030
looking at their code or looking at

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,190
their tickets and asking them questions

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,870
the point is to get them taking

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,700
responsibility for presenting to you

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,910
rather than you taking responsibility

00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,470
for dragging information out of them and

00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,930
then you correct just the critical

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,700
problems it's not a big deal if they do

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,550
something differently than you would if

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,840
it's not meaningfully like a problem so

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,850
you only want to focus on what they

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,100
really need to know and then you answer

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,760
the questions that they have but I will

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,380
note that when I started out people were

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,940
coming to me and asking questions and I

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,640
was just answering them as fast as they

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,490
could ask them and now what I say more

00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,820
is what have you tried so far and have

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,650
you tried googling that

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,450
to train people to come to me when they

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,560
are a little bit more sure that what

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,630
they're dealing with is something they

00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,800
need help with not just coming to me so

00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,750
they don't have to put in the creative

00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,130
thinking themselves and then finally if

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,180
they've done great tell them that like

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,550
there's nothing more rewarding for

00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,780
people than hearing you did awesome with

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,730
us when it's something that they have

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,050
struggled with in the past or just when

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,650
they're overachievers and I like to hear

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,210
it so this process taken together helps

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,470
the people who work with you hone their

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,540
critical thinking skills and their

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,550
presentation skills and it also keeps

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,290
you aware of how tasks are really going

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,330
until you're ready to take the training

00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,770
wheels off and say like you've you know

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,210
you've killed the last three projects

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,380
that we talked about you can just run

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,120
with us like you don't need to brief me

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,010
on it just go and that's a really

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,730
fantastic feeling especially if you are

00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:34,950
a coaching leader so now we come to the

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,490
the second skill and the last one we'll

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:41,100
talk about because it's the biggest

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,390
giving constructive feedback how many

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,330
people here have done a performance

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:47,010
review have given a performance review

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,800
so you've probably had that moment when

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:51,930
you are having to tell someone this is

00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,850
really like you really need to improve

00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,230
this and sometimes you've even had the

00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,490
moment where you're saying you really

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,070
need to improve this or we're gonna have

00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,900
to let you go these conversations are

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,960
not fun there's really no way to make

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:07,590
them fun but what you can keep in mind

00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,510
instead is that what I'm being nice

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,580
about what people need to work on is not

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,260
the same thing as being kind to them if

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,980
I could go back in time and talk to my

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,970
2014 self this is the advice that I

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,070
would give her because at times when you

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,720
as a developer you're lacking authority

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,340
over the work of the people around you

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,030
and you lack responsibility for their

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,590
career so you you don't get to control

00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,060
whether they get promoted you don't

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,800
control like whether they get laid off

00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,850
you know you can give feedback about

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,920
their performance but you don't

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,590
ultimately act on it but as a manager

00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,360
you do you are usually the person

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,030
determining when people move up you are

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,740
definitely involved in conversations

00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,480
about when it's no longer productive for

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,740
them to be at the company and if you

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,080
aren't giving that feedback really

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,520
directly to the people in question then

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,270
you're robbing them of the opportunity

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,360
to course-correct

00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:59,070
or to move up to say if they don't

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,230
realize that all they had to do to move

00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,370
into that senior role they

00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,980
was to correct the way they're

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,270
communicating with their peers just tell

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:09,320
them that and then they can figure out

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:11,360
how to move forward so I like to make

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,790
sure that performance feedback meets all

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,700
three of these criteria first of all

00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,480
that it is really direct shouldn't you

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,070
shouldn't be trying to figure out what

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,790
your managers telling you it's important

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,200
that it is balanced so it's taking into

00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:27,080
account both what people are really

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,850
strong in and what their weekend you're

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,070
telling someone you know this has been a

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,480
problem on the last few projects you've

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,220
done I really need you to work on it

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,559
it's a very good idea to balance that

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,690
with you know you have picked up these

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,880
skills so well and it applies some of

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,840
that to this problem as well and if

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,910
you're the kind of person who gives

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,980
positive feedback negative feedback more

00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,230
naturally you also need to take time to

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,380
really make sure that you're balancing

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:53,110
that out and finally it should be

00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,980
thoughtful like don't toss out

00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,299
proclamations about people's performance

00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,309
off-the-cuff and expect them to take it

00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:59,870
well don't tell people like your

00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:01,340
attitudes really gone downhill I need

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,780
you to work on that and then get

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,500
surprised when they ask you can you give

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:08,210
me an example of that come prepared to

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,340
these conversations and think about what

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:16,190
they're gonna say before you actually

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:18,200
give them the feedback so if you it may

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,700
be helpful for you to mentally rehearse

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,559
some of the tougher conversations you're

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,780
about to have when I was starting out I

00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,690
would actually script like the opening

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,220
paragraph of what I had to tell people

00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,230
and if you if it's harder for you to

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,240
react in the moment to management

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,790
challenges which like it would be if

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,799
you're new then if there's really no

00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,850
shame and doing more over preparation to

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,270
make sure that your feedback is

00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:43,460
thoughtful so most importantly you have

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,049
to take out the guesswork if you've had

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,970
a manager you really hated you probably

00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:48,650
hated them in part because you knew that

00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,350
they you weren't quite doing what they

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,120
needed but you didn't know how to fix

00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,120
the problem you didn't know what you

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,679
could demonstrate to them that would

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,480
that would meet the criteria that they

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,830
were laying out for you it's leaves

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,360
people feeling really paranoid and

00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,120
really insecure about their job

00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,770
performance so by being direct balanced

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,659
and thoughtful you might not always be

00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,070
saying something people want to hear but

00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:13,040
you can make sure that they know what to

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,090
do with what you're telling them one way

00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,270
to make sure that the feed

00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,740
meets these criteria is to prepare your

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,650
reviews with a really holistic

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,900
perspective I like to reach out to

00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,160
people's peers in addition to providing

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,780
my own feedback so I start out with my

00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,710
outline of their major accomplishments

00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,720
and the major things that they're

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,210
struggling with and then I talk to their

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,130
project managers their fellow developers

00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,540
people of their mentoring or who are

00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,300
mentoring them to get more of a

00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,370
360-degree view of their feedback in my

00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,440
opinion companies that take this

00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,870
feedback anonymously and then put it in

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,180
people's reviews anonymously are doing

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,920
the worst of all possible worlds because

00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,480
then you're seeing like in print what

00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,180
people like or don't like about you

00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,030
but you lack context completely so what

00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,980
I do instead is I review and validate

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,750
the feedback that I get from people and

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,520
then when it's positive I put it in

00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,620
there with attribution so if for example

00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,290
Alexis has been doing a fantastic job

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,690
which Alexis always says by the way then

00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:14,020
and Sam tells me that then I want to

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,310
take the time to actually write down

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,140
here's the feedback Sam provided like

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,790
you did a really great job with this and

00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:22,430
it made her job much easier and better

00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,220
and have Alexis get to see in print that

00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:26,690
her work is validated and appreciated

00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,100
and on the other hand and this should

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,530
not need to be said I'm gonna say it

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,120
anyway don't put quotes from people

00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,270
about what other people are doing wrong

00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,890
in their abuse just don't like anytime

00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,060
someone tells you that a person is

00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,130
struggling with an aspect of their job

00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,720
it is your job as a manager to figure

00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,640
out how to make that actionable and

00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,530
constructive and to validate whether or

00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,390
not it's actually true you do not get

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,790
points for saying some people say that

00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:51,890
you're hard to work with and not

00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,140
explaining it giving context or saying

00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:58,220
here's what we need you to demonstrate

00:34:53,140 --> 00:35:00,280
differently so I have gotten really

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:03,260
helpful feedback through this process

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,690
first of all I've gotten people telling

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,630
me that someone who had was like a

00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,920
really great communicator was really

00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,110
struggling with their development work

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,090
on projects and you know that the team

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:17,270
was struggling to make up for it I've

00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,100
had people also say that folks that

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,720
whose work I didn't value enough we're

00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,340
doing an incredible job and taking the

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,780
load off their team leads in a way that

00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,810
I wasn't aware of because I wasn't on

00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,980
all their projects so this helps you get

00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,079
much more

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,510
get a much more holistic picture of how

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,130
people are actually doing and how you

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,190
present it is actually really important

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,380
to I like to start out with feedback on

00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,829
people's accomplishments and then set

00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,150
goals collaboratively with them so they

00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:46,490
tell me what they're interested in in

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,950
the next six years to a month and then I

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,660
find the focus the success criteria for

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:52,400
each of those so they know when they've

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,950
actually achieved it and we can review

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,790
their performance in the next review I

00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:59,570
talked about what they should start

00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:01,310
doing either because you know if you

00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,660
start doing this here's how it you can

00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,490
move up and here's how it can affect

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,990
your career positively or because they

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,770
should have already started doing it and

00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,560
I need them to pick up that

00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:11,089
responsibility and then what they need

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,790
to stop doing this is self-explanatory

00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:16,130
its corrective feedback stop doing it

00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,599
but I also talked about what they need

00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,130
to continue doing and make sure that I

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,589
end it in that way so that it goes

00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,000
positive negative positive and ends on a

00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:25,070
note of looking forward to the future

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,550
not a note of here's what you need to

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,740
change but of course like just don't

00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,030
wait for reviews to give feedback again

00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,849
this is something that I would tell my

00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,260
younger self if I could conversations

00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:38,329
are pretty hard to have during

00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,619
one-on-ones and they feel a lot less

00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:43,099
official because you're not getting

00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:45,260
printed documentation but it's really

00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:49,220
critical to have them frequently both

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:51,230
because then people get to people get to

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,359
respond to things and provide guidance I

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,770
provide context in a moment like I know

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,150
that the designer said that I was being

00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,460
difficult to work with but here's the

00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,260
actual situation and because they get

00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,880
used to hearing performance related

00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,460
feedback from you at regular intervals

00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,960
and they don't you don't have a giant

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,250
backlog of things that you need to talk

00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,599
about at the end of the year when the

00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,710
employee is coming to you saying hey

00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:15,650
I've done a great job and I want to

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:17,180
raise so the developing people again my

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,770
the things that I would advise you to

00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,780
focus on are learning how to delegate

00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:22,730
and providing that oversight rather than

00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,680
either not delegating or throwing things

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,109
into a box and expecting people to run

00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,700
with them and I would also say that

00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:30,650
giving constructive feedback is one of

00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,000
the hardest strengths to build but it

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,410
helps you improve the performance of

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,020
your team pretty dramatically over time

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,670
so looking forward after you have really

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,670
gotten a handle on these critical things

00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,730
management is a really rewarding place

00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,290
to be there's a lot that you can

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,910
accomplish and there's a huge impact you

00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:52,850
can have compared to being an individual

00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:55,250
contributor these skills set you up to

00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,690
make sure that you know you act you

00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,420
understand the effect that what you're

00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:02,210
doing is having on morale to make sure

00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:06,140
that you can make changes when you need

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:08,420
to so for example I had a situation with

00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,030
my team where a new manager had had a

00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,440
problem with the same problem with two

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,290
different people a couple weeks apart

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,700
and it had impacted client work so I

00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,470
talked to the manager about it

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,970
she took responsibility for it and she

00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,190
sorted the problem out but then she came

00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:24,200
back to me and said honestly we've grown

00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,880
too much and I'm managing too many

00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,770
different types of people I'm managing

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,020
developers like technical strategists

00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,310
technical managers and I'm struggling to

00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,080
get the right feedback to the right

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,090
people and make sure these lessons are

00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,400
self reinforcing so I wound up

00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:40,190
reorganizing the team so that people

00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,320
managed people manage the people who had

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,730
expertise in what they were also doing

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,710
so WordPress developers managing

00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,150
WordPress developers Drupal friends

00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,940
managing friends Drupal backends

00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:52,280
managing backends and this created like

00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,960
concrete practice areas so that people

00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,610
could share knowledge more effectively

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,830
and it wasn't relying on a manager to

00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,660
give top-down feedback every time those

00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,880
kind of big changes have a huge impact

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,590
on the team but they only work if you

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,330
have these essential communication

00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:07,430
styles upfront and you've already

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:11,000
created this trust with your team and

00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,650
finally this helps you build a

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,160
self-reinforcing team that can run

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:18,200
itself and sustain itself without you so

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,700
setting keeve the key values setting a

00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,920
mission making sure that people

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,930
understand how you judge quality makes

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,350
them more able to understand how their

00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,940
work impacts the team and to react to it

00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,680
when they or other people make mistakes

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:34,100
and this means you actually get to enjoy

00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,690
weekends occasionally which is great so

00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,630
I'll leave you with this quote about

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,640
what great managers do they look for

00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,560
what is unique about every person and

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,550
then they capitalize on it they realize

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,350
that their people are not

00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,480
interchangeable they are not uniform

00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,800
it's not like playing checkers it's like

00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,740
playing a pretty complicated game of

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,320
chess and their ability to communicate

00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,960
clearly to swap leadership styles to

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,510
deal with different

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,730
metaphorical pieces on the board and

00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:01,349
their ability to monitor performance and

00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,400
make changes when they need to can lead

00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:04,890
to really big results

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,780
so I firmly believe that good management

00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:09,359
is the single most rewarding thing that

00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:12,330
you can do with your career and I wish

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,410
you guys look as you also do it so

00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,660
thanks for your time and attention today

00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,190
if you like reading about these concepts

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,180
I highly recommend the things over here

00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,070
on the right

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,230
especially the Harvard Business Review

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,720
is compendium of articles on managing

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,790
people you can find me at webby cat if

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,109
you want to again nerd out about any of

00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,090
this and I'm really happy to take

00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:33,870
questions now

00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:35,450
[Applause]

00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:40,570
[Music]

00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:40,570
[Applause]

00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,950
can you anyway because it's being

00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,950
recorded

00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:56,430
sure so everybody back home can hear

00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,050
we're gonna do this as a webinar for a

00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,970
Drupal forgoes so if you've missed any

00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,890
of this we'll make sure this is possible

00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,270
and out there for everyone else cool oh

00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:10,530
she can answer your questions online

00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:13,050
I believe I've just been voluntold you

00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:15,450
any suggestions or tips for a manager

00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:21,030
and a very small team that also needs to

00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:22,950
be at the same time hmm I do so first of

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,290
all for managers who are on smaller

00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,640
teams and are developing I would say

00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,140
that the really important part is

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,440
figuring out what you can delegate and

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,670
what you can't if you are a manager of a

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,590
small team and you're working with a

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,030
couple other junior people the way that

00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,590
you build them up over time is

00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,869
fundamentally different from if you are

00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:44,160
working with two other senior people so

00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:45,570
that sketch of giving giving out tasks

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,820
while still providing oversight becomes

00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,530
really critical I would also argue that

00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,510
you get to know the team much better

00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,920
over time so you really understand what

00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,619
they're good at and what they're not and

00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,580
you're able to counterbalance so if

00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,660
you're working with if you are a

00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,859
back-end developer and you're working

00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,840
with two people who are stronger in

00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,580
front-end it's okay to take on more of

00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,260
those back-end tasks initially and then

00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,180
gradually release them over time to

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,240
build people up I'm curious that whether

00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:14,910
that answers your question

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:16,590
okay so if you work on a team and you

00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,859
have several stakeholders that are

00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:23,090
requesting things from that team how

00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:25,350
would you recommend coaching them or

00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:28,050
helping them to work with those

00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,730
stakeholders because I know that that

00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,880
can get overwhelming for them sometimes

00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,920
so I'm just curious as to how you would

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,140
recommend coaching them to work with

00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,480
them do you mean like people going

00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,480
directly to developers rather than going

00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,270
through a project manager yeah gotcha so

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:50,070
first of all we get a project manager

00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:50,390
but I would I found the most important

00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,160
thing for

00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,960
is building empathy on both sides of the

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,819
fence if you have access to talk to

00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,140
those stakeholders about the challenges

00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:58,430
that your team faces like if they're

00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,190
actually part of your company for

00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,230
example and talking about hey if you can

00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,000
handle this in a more official process

00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,069
like if you can file tickets rather than

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,569
finding someone and calling them then we

00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:10,910
can respond to you better because we

00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:13,130
have the opportunity to put that into a

00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,450
more normal workflow first of all but if

00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,859
you just don't have that option and you

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:19,670
need to get your team comfortable with

00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:21,440
hearing that getting stakeholder

00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,849
questions thrown at them talking to them

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,140
about what the stakeholders are facing

00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:25,760
and really building that so they

00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,809
understand what they can do with their

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,269
input is valuable

00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:30,829
I find that initially people are more

00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:32,930
likely to throw out like yes I can do it

00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:35,029
or no I can't do it and they can get

00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,549
very defensive or they can get they can

00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:39,769
over commit to way too much so talking

00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:41,390
them through when you say that you can

00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:42,619
handle something and you can't here is

00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,869
the impact that it has on the

00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:47,690
stakeholders here's a concrete time that

00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:49,010
this has backfired on our team or when

00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,109
you say you can't do it and you actually

00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,890
can you reduce the trust and you make it

00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:53,599
more likely that they're gonna

00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,519
micromanage you later they're gonna

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,529
constantly come back so I think that

00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,509
walking people through the practical

00:43:57,529 --> 00:44:07,369
consequences is helpful if you can't get

00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:10,460
that in a more normal process any

00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:14,630
thoughts or tips in a situation where a

00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:16,789
lot of the normal manager roles are not

00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,500
present so for example large

00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:24,259
organization where you don't have any

00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:33,650
say over promotions raises things like

00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:37,339
that is your question how to motivate

00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:40,759
people or just any thoughts generally on

00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:43,789
you know people ask about things like

00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:47,420
that you know a lot of the advice on how

00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:50,359
to answer those questions right it

00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,390
doesn't really apply so I would

00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:56,390
recommend if it's that you aren't in

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,279
control of the folks the the livelihoods

00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,599
of the people below you you have to have

00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:02,089
more conversation with the people above

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,470
you part of what I would recommend is

00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:04,160
talking to the folks who do make those

00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,090
decisions

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,440
the effect on the team of you know if it

00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,610
is that people are concerned because

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,930
they're staying stagnant for a really

00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:14,270
long time and there is no upward

00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,830
mobility for them or that the pay is

00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,150
staying stagnant and they feel that they

00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,620
can get better paid somewhere else I

00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,120
found that having a practical

00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,530
conversation with leadership about the

00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,240
effect of having to hire someone new

00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:26,330
into that role will go a lot farther

00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,550
than you think it will so I usually

00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:32,660
start there and then secondly working

00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:35,000
with people in those in those

00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,440
conversations with leadership having

00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,330
conversations about what would have to

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,920
happen for them to be comfortable making

00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,180
decisions and then being armed with that

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,640
knowledge when you talk to the folks

00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,760
below you that's also helpful if the

00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,730
answer is there is no way for this team

00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,050
to move up and improve then it's good

00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,400
for you to know that because the odds

00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,840
are that you're gonna have to shift to a

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,460
model where you are accepting a certain

00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,660
amount of churn and burn where people

00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,980
are gonna cycle in and out and you're

00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,870
gonna perpetually have to invest money

00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,670
in training and having an organization

00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,380
see that play out can really make

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,970
changes than how they mentor and recruit

00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:07,100
talent over time but in the moment it is

00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,540
a really hard challenge with all that

00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,760
said once you have a sense of what

00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,350
people have to do differently to impress

00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,060
leadership you can have more productive

00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:16,000
conversations with them and you can also

00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,680
talk to them practically speaking about

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,270
what they want out of this job like if

00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,220
you can't you know move up from

00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,780
developer to senior developer what do

00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,760
you want to leave here ultimately having

00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,560
known what do you want to get better at

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,940
as a result of your time here and then

00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,160
you can work with them to improve their

00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,800
skills over time rather than working to

00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:38,060
retain them forever thank you

00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:40,510
it's a good question so given that these

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,730
promotions can sometimes be competitive

00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:46,580
do you have any tips on how you handle

00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:48,200
someone you were competing with and how

00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,400
you smooth things over because you're

00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,470
now their boss were you were their

00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,390
teammate before and how you prevent them

00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:57,620
from totally resenting you I have no

00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:59,330
feelings about this oh god so the

00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,430
transitional one-on-ones really do help

00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,200
because you can get some of that subtext

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,510
out there so for example if you are

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,580
dealing with a super like

00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:12,050
process-oriented developer who like

00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,240
maybe didn't have the vision to lead the

00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:16,010
team but who has a lot of really good

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,600
skills that they bring telling them I

00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,710
value what you're doing here

00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,750
I want to make sure that I can continue

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,970
supporting you and doing it I know this

00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,460
is gonna be a bit awkward but I want to

00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:26,690
figure out how we can make this working

00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,670
relationship as good as it can possibly

00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:31,220
be because what you bring to the team is

00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:35,480
absolutely essential that goes a long

00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:37,910
way I would also say new managers often

00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,710
feel this pressure to like to have all

00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,540
the answers with their team and to

00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:42,530
charge forward saying like this is what

00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,330
we should do and I know it's what we

00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,980
should do and consciously training

00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,900
yourself to look at this person and say

00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,390
here's what I think what do you think

00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,920
and making them an ally in your

00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:53,450
leadership rather than someone that

00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,340
you're perpetually fighting with can

00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:58,250
also really help especially if they are

00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,960
like also kind of overachieving them

00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,430
feeling heard and feeling like they're

00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,810
still able to have an effect on the team

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,610
and they're teeing themselves up to take

00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:09,490
that position in the long run can make

00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:09,490
them more receptive to working with you

00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:16,220
in terms of fostering that kind of

00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:18,590
mentoring atmosphere and good management

00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:20,420
atmosphere to this question that kind of

00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,730
has many implications potentially but

00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,490
what is kind of like a rough number of

00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:28,100
how many employees you might see as

00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:30,710
under you as a manager as an ideal kind

00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:33,040
of ratio like there's some range in what

00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,630
this question is so good

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,370
do you mean in order to mentor people

00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,140
how many people can you mentor before

00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,970
you tip over or do you mean how many

00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,020
people can you manage before you tip

00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,880
over right we're talking about

00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,620
developing people rather than code like

00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,580
how many people can you successfully

00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:51,890
develop without failing at your job it

00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:55,010
really depends on how much development

00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:57,590
they need if you are dealing with a very

00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:59,210
junior team I would not personally I

00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,540
don't like having more than two maybe

00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:05,360
three really junior people at once and I

00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:07,010
currently am pretty far along in my

00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,870
career I feel good about my management

00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,480
skills but if you saddle me with a team

00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:13,010
of like seven people who are all trying

00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,360
to learn their job there's no way for me

00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,770
to be successful in that because I have

00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,860
to pay too much attention to each person

00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:22,460
when I first got promoted to director I

00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:24,110
would say that number was closer to 1 1

00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:27,170
maybe 2 if they're really well motivated

00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,730
so that said if people are you know

00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,530
pretty solid at their jobs and they just

00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:31,460
meet minimal communication and minimal

00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,050
feedback occasionally

00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,730
you can do a lot of good mentoring

00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:37,250
people in relatively little amount of

00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:43,250
time if they're already mid-level so I

00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:45,980
would recommend thinking about how much

00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:47,870
work these individual people are saving

00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,730
or saving you and then trying to back

00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:52,250
that out of your time so for example I

00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:54,200
once hired someone who was a little bit

00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,670
more junior at the time and they were

00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,890
worried about taking up too much of my

00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:00,020
time and like they came to me with

00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:03,740
questions pretty regularly and I wound

00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:05,480
up telling them like if I spend 10 hours

00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,860
this week talking to you but it saves me

00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,230
the 40 hours this week I would have

00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,940
spent doing your job we're still good so

00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,650
if you can draw a line between how much

00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,000
your day-to-day responsibilities need

00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:19,580
you and how much time you have left over

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:22,670
it helps because this talk is going from

00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:26,120
developer to manager is his project

00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:28,670
management a crucial skill set that's

00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,230
needed or is it possible for to move

00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,060
right from developer to that more

00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,380
managerial I would definitely argue you

00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,670
can go from developer to more managerial

00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,560
as long as you have a strong project

00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:38,360
manager to keep like the trains running

00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,800
on time I definitely don't think you

00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:45,170
need to be a project manager to be a

00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:48,530
strong team leader you definitely need

00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:52,130
to be a project manager to just an

00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:54,680
opinion I've really liked it but I am a

00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,510
little bit in doubt what the bounds are

00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:00,410
of what you're talking about is it

00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:03,710
culturally geographically as a manager

00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:07,550
of remote developers from maybe 8 or 10

00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:09,020
different cultures there's many things I

00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:11,360
would like to poke hole in what you're

00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,510
saying so could you say something about

00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,850
this this is maybe a us-centric thing

00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,980
especially the high right the hierarchy

00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,990
you're talking about an organization

00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:23,330
doesn't work in circular organization

00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:24,980
for instance that's very true I would

00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:29,090
definitely say this is a us-centric talk

00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:31,190
I have for the most almost entirely

00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:35,210
managed folks who are based in the US

00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:37,700
with a couple exceptions so the way that

00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:39,830
I see managing people it is very driven

00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,270
by people who want heavy guide who want

00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,070
guidance but who also want some

00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,990
independence as opposed to cultures

00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,170
where it's much more based on deference

00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,549
and

00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,980
respect and you're not going to get that

00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:50,809
sort of honest feedback unless you know

00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,339
you've worked together for years so I do

00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:53,809
think that people who are managing an

00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:55,819
international team have a very different

00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:58,099
set of challenges I'd argue that a

00:51:55,819 --> 00:52:00,200
remote team that is culturally similar a

00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:02,299
lot of this does apply but I think

00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,799
that's a great way to look at this I'm

00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:06,950
sorry if I can just follow up

00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:11,000
how would you then apply culture to try

00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:13,609
and cultivate now I really really want

00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,109
to give a talk on that I wish I had a

00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:16,369
good answer for you on that but since

00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:18,740
it's a challenge that I haven't faced

00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,650
myself I would hesitate to give you

00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,900
feedback on it I do think I there's some

00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,670
great articles about that that I'd love

00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,910
to share but I'm sorry I'm not gonna be

00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:31,369
the person to tell you that one as a

00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:33,980
manager who was originally more of a

00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:37,220
generalist I now am in charge of a team

00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:39,170
which was extremely specialized highly

00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,579
intelligent people that know much more

00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,990
about their subject than I do

00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:43,579
mm-hmm how do you have any

00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,950
recommendations for that situation I

00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:47,390
would tend to recommend that's one of

00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,740
the Styles where a democratic leadership

00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,210
style works pretty well

00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,960
coaching doesn't work great

00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:54,950
authoritative doesn't work great but

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,030
recognizing what those people bring to

00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,280
the table and then being more

00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,740
affiliative and more democratic helps

00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,079
like be having a servant leadership

00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:05,299
mentality where you say I'm here to help

00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,160
you be successful I want to hear from

00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:09,049
you what challenges you faced in this

00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,369
organization and I want to talk to you

00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:12,020
about how I can make them better as

00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:13,280
opposed to I'm gonna give you

00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,770
instruction and you're going to go

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,450
follow it it's a subtle mind subtle a

00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:20,630
paradigm shift but it's essential for a

00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:23,540
team like that I would recommend the on

00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:27,920
managing people book the first article

00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:29,780
deals with that and I think too many

00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,240
bosses too few leaders also gets into it

00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,859
but it's a really really great article

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:40,579
on what to do when with high-performing

00:53:33,859 --> 00:53:43,420
teams any recommendations or how to

00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:48,319
survive through a company inflection or

00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:50,510
organization change so my company is

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,950
going from a flat organization to a more

00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:54,280
structured with project managers and

00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:58,090
onboarding new people we've grown from

00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:00,310
honestly over the past year or so and so

00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:03,130
people are really confused but also the

00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:05,380
vision in a strategy of the company

00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,930
isn't clear yet so we're trying things

00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,190
and testing things out any

00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,140
recommendations on how to approach that

00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:13,660
with different leadership styles to kind

00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,120
of help through that inflection point

00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,500
has your team been there long do they

00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,750
understand like the old company well

00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,700
they s they do they understand the old

00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,970
company well but the new company hasn't

00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:27,010
been established yet because we've hired

00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:29,740
a lot of talent and we're doing a lot of

00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:34,930
projects and trying to move from a

00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:36,640
production house into a strategic that

00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:39,220
does that makes a lot of sense I've

00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,050
dealt with something similar how much

00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,430
access do you have to the people who are

00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,940
determining what the new company is

00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:45,940
gonna look like

00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,250
a lot of access so kind of been meeting

00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,830
with them regularly but as we're testing

00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,510
out new strategies and changing so

00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,970
something basically changes every week

00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:57,250
or every month right so it's kind of

00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,900
like well what like we said we were

00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:01,090
doing this but then it's changed to this

00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,680
and then oh well it's gonna change for

00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:04,980
this so I'm gonna have like a poor

00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:08,140
attitude about it type of thing so

00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:10,030
ordinarily I like talking about how to

00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:12,040
keep people happy and how to retain them

00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,630
in this particular case I would tend to

00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,620
say that you have to accept that there

00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:16,750
will be a certain amount of attrition

00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:18,130
like there will be people who don't see

00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,450
themselves in the new company or who

00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:21,040
don't have the patience to make it

00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:23,140
through that I think the sooner you

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:26,320
accept that your goal is to take the

00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:28,300
people who are are willing to get in

00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,160
line and to wait and to have like the

00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,510
attitude of being comfortable with

00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,460
waiting for some of that change the

00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:36,240
better off you wind up being but that

00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,380
said for those people I would recommend

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,480
I'd recommend talking with them about

00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,670
the major concerns that they have about

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,450
the organization if it's that they feel

00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,160
like they don't know how their

00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:47,590
performance is going to be judged then

00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,030
making time to talk to the people who

00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,440
are leading the company to say I really

00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,660
want to talk about performance reviews

00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,340
this is how we've judged performance in

00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:56,320
the past can you tell me if it's going

00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,670
to stay similar and then either being

00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,230
able to say right now we've got

00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,850
commitment on this it might change in

00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,620
the future but we're gonna continue as a

00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,720
team working toward this until we hear

00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:08,110
otherwise or if they're really worried

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,310
about you know I knew how to

00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,990
developed successfully in the old

00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:14,560
structure but now we're introducing like

00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:18,760
code review and we're you know using

00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:22,660
version control differently then based

00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:25,480
on true story then making it clear to

00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,410
them that as you do add new parts to

00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,730
their job you're going to give the

00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,440
coaching to them necessary for them to

00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,210
be successful and really committing to

00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,830
that like that's not just words

00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:34,810
that's making sure that you identify the

00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,460
high performers who can figure out how

00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,930
to be successful in the new model and

00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,180
then you set them up to do more training

00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:41,890
with the rest of the team I hope that

00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:48,610
helps yeah it helps so focus so

00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:50,530
basically company culture yes definitely

00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:52,630
stay in this culture growth plans are

00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:54,430
super helpful like laying out right now

00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:56,050
we've been doing it like this we're

00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,520
going to add in these new skills here's

00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:59,290
how we're gonna get there setting up

00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,510
like lunch and well lunch and learns are

00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:04,090
evil but setting up meetings not over

00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,950

00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:07,780
new and have the team start providing

marry like the high performers with the

00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:14,980
lower performers also really helps okay
