Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Developer to Manager: A Survival Guide
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Good work leads to promotions -- and promotions from development to management come with more than increases in responsibility. While they're often awarded based on mastery of one skill set, they require you to learn a whole new one. Plus, the methods you've previously used for learning new skills might fail you -- this learning curve would be a lot easier if you could just googleÂ "drush commands for management" until you found some results.

During this session, I'll talk about adjusting from life as a developer to life as a manager, including:

Avoiding the pacesetting leader trap.
Giving performance feedback that goes beyond code reviews.
Giving room to make mistakes (while mitigating the big risks).
Communicating like a team leader, not a team member.
Investing time in people, not projects.

This session is targeted toward new managers and developers considering management, by a former developer who made the leap and loved it.
