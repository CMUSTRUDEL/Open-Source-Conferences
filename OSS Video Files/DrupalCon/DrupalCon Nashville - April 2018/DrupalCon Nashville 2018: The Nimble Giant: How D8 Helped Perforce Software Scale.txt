Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: The Nimble Giant: How D8 Helped Perforce Software Scale
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Perforce version control is used by 8 of the top 10 electronics companies like Samsung and Micron, and 18 of the top 20 game development companies, like Ubisoft and Epic Games. The software leader needed a powerful, customizable website to serve their large content team and scale with the rapid growth of business.  

We helped Perforce design, architect, and rebuild a B2B website that allows administrators to take advantage of Drupal’s flexibility and ease-of-use. The new site leverages SEO, integrates with third party tools like Marketo, and provides a more efficient content management process. We leveraged Drupal’s un-opinionated structural framework to build an architecture-first tool that models Perforce Software’s business structure and is flexible enough to grow and change along with them.

In a project that showcases Drupal 8’s capacity for enterprise website development, the new Perforce website delivers a seamless online experience for customers and site administrators alike. If you are a developer integrating third-party tools or work in the SaaS industry and are considering Drupal 8, this session will offer a landscape view of what to expect.
