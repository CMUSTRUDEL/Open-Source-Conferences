Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: The Nimble Giant: How D8 Helped Perforce Software Scale
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Perforce version control is used by 8 of the top 10 electronics companies like Samsung and Micron, and 18 of the top 20 game development companies, like Ubisoft and Epic Games. The software leader needed a powerful, customizable website to serve their large content team and scale with the rapid growth of business.  

We helped Perforce design, architect, and rebuild a B2B website that allows administrators to take advantage of Drupal’s flexibility and ease-of-use. The new site leverages SEO, integrates with third party tools like Marketo, and provides a more efficient content management process. We leveraged Drupal’s un-opinionated structural framework to build an architecture-first tool that models Perforce Software’s business structure and is flexible enough to grow and change along with them.

In a project that showcases Drupal 8’s capacity for enterprise website development, the new Perforce website delivers a seamless online experience for customers and site administrators alike. If you are a developer integrating third-party tools or work in the SaaS industry and are considering Drupal 8, this session will offer a landscape view of what to expect.

	00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:09,179
hello everybody gonna interrupt your

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,750
kind of 15-minute break that you're

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,990
coming off of so we're really excited to

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,420
talk to you guys today we are talking

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,300
about a Drupal showcase project that

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,699
we've done with a client of ours it's

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,609
within the ambitious digital experiences

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,590
track so it's a little bit of a less

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,480
technical talk and it's more focusing

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,489
around the business challenge that we

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,040
faced how we collaborated with our

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,380
client how we solved the technical

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,940
problems that we faced and most

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,820
importantly the impact that it had on

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,820
the business so we have the pleasure of

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,800
having our client with us today which is

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,649
super exciting so I'll let her introduce

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,030
herself hi everyone I'm Chelsea - Flitz

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:02,910
key I'm the director of marketing for

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,729
perforce software I'm Anthony Simone I

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,250
am a senior developer elevated third and

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,700
on this project I was the lead developer

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,580
working with Chelsea and I'm Kate Shire

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,090
I'm a Senior Account Manager at elevated

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:23,610
third so I tag-teamed this project with

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:26,040
Anthony so Anthony I work at elevated

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,369
third with a few other III people in the

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,159
audience today we're at a digital agency

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,369
based in Denver Colorado we primarily

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,890
focus on enterprise level b2b kind of

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,180
large-scale websites we've had the

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,579
pleasure of working with a lot of

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,420
digitally focused software companies

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,549
like perforce which is fantastic and

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,680
we're really focusing on solving

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,970
technology and marketing problems so

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,970
bringing those two pieces together

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,420
for for software it solves the

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,430
challenges that come with large-scale

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,410
development so that could be large teams

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,320
large file sizes or maybe just lots of

00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,990
files but basically our software tries

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,550
to remove the technology barriers so

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:25,190
that developers and designers can just

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:29,250
innovate so our session goals today are

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,230
we want to kind of use the pillars of

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,320
per for scalability flexibility and

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,380
reliability to talk about how Drupal is

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,170
able to build a system that exemplifies

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,670
those three items and we're gonna talk a

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,020
little bit technically to give some

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,300
background but we're really gonna focus

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,040
on what this project looked like from

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,810
the client perspective and what that

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,430
story was and discuss real client-side

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,020
business processes and improvements that

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,640
were results from this project we're

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,920
gonna touch on each of those three

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,470
pillars scalability scalability

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,940
flexibility and reliability from the

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,730
point of view of the challenge the

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:15,000
solution and the outcome both on the

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:17,730
technical side and on the client side so

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,100
perforce began as a start-up in 1996 in

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,170
the Bay Area today we have eight offices

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,560
worldwide we've got over 200 employees

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,980
and just over 3,000 customers we have a

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,989
99% customer retention rate and half of

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,030
our deployment base has been with us for

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:37,890
more than 10 years our first product was

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,560
a version control or source control

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,630
system called p4 today it's called helix

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,820
core and in the last two years we've

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,680
expanded our product portfolio so we now

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,410
have additional tools for developer

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,540
collaboration agile project management

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,829
and agile planning perforce is well

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,870
known in the game development

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,489
semiconductor and electronics industries

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,739
this is due to our ability to version

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,930
all file types and sizes including large

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,130
binary files so for example with a game

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,970
development company they're gonna have

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,690
large video or image files

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,120
in 2017 our company was really poised

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,580
for growth we had private equity

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,510
investment we had a new leadership team

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:23,000
and we had some very ambitious goals as

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,700
we stood on that precipice we realized

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,790
that the website was a risk perforce

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,370
calm was built on d7 it was a static

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,890
site with an outdated design and it had

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,690
been built by two outside agencies at

00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,120
different times so it was cobbled

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,210
together by our internal IT team and it

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,250
was just a mess of conflicting code and

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,980
stylesheets and tons of outdated content

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,910
and it just took a really long time to

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,350
make any sort of update to it so the

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,670
first requirement that we had for

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,380
elevated third was that we wanted to

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:58,010
build a site that was going to scale in

00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,390
the long term as I mentioned we had a

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,650
new leadership team and they had plans

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,260
to really grow the company both

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,420
organically and via acquisition we had

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,810
just completed our first acquisition at

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,700
the end of 2016 we knew more were coming

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,169
but we didn't know when we didn't know

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,919
how many and we didn't know what they

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,380
were gonna be

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,600
we were also rebranding our current

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,480
products while launching new ones and

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:27,680
our marketing team had increased from 5

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:31,400
to 25 people so based on all the

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,650
contexts that Chelsea gave it was clear

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,960
that the product portfolio at this point

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,990
was not clearly defined and this was the

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,030
discovery portion of this project right

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,160
so we had no idea what things were gonna

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,850
look like in a year or in six months or

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:50,390
even at lunch which at this point was a

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,860
five month project timeline so at this

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,930
point in discovery we were we were

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,300
trying to figure out what what we needed

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,980
to do right we needed some kind of

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,370
solution that was going to work for

00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:07,490
lunch and be able to develop and scale

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:09,590
with these unknowns and just anecdotally

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,780
being in the the full day discovery

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,020
session we had with Chelsea and her

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,940
large very large client team we always

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,950
go into those meetings and there are

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,950
and there are questions and we discuss

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,990
things this felt like a lot of

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,270
discussion right we're literally

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,830
whiteboarding different product

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,410
architecture scenarios and we were

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,850
thinking about oh maybe we don't just

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,400
have actual products but that there are

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,430
umbrellas categories and they previously

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,350
had this pretty strong branding element

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,820
of a bee and and we're like oh maybe

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,280
we'll have the bee maybe we won't have

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,380
the B there was just a lot of discussion

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,190
and so it was very exciting and at the

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:52,280
same time

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:55,670
a lot of unknowns so essentially at this

00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:00,110
point for a scalability we had a goal

00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,910
right our scalability goal was to build

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,910
a drupal solution that will fill the

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,710
requirements to find during discovery

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,620
but we'll be able to be updated handle

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:13,040
new project new products new lines new

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,870
business models so essentially at this

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,270
point our our goal might sound

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,950
suspiciously like can you build a tool

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,350
for us that'll do everything we need now

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,500
and everything we need in the future but

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:28,280
we don't know what we need so that's

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:40,220
kind of a challenge and and Kate and I

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:44,600
are emojis this is going to become this

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,070
is gonna be a challenge so at this point

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,500
from a project planning point of view

00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,660
everything was kind of a dread alert

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,370
right going through just some of the

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,380
some of the things you might we might

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,000
talk about in discovery like what what

00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,130
level of variability or what level of

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,770
risk was there at this point and it was

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,470
very high like how many unknowns are

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,330
there a lot there are many unknowns

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,850
there were questions coming in kind of

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,590
like from from all directions and the

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,600
single most important part of the

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,570
project at this point which was the

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,280
content around the products the product

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,370
architecture the presentation of the

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,870
products was the one piece that was the

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:27,169
least defined and from the project

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,090
management standpoint putting together

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,500
the timeline is always one of the fun

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,830
things to do at the beginning of the

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,310
proud

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,719
and we had a strict deadline right we

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,789
were trying to launch this thing by May

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,010
there are a lot of pieces that were

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,659
supposed to launch at the same time and

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,330
so we did not want the website to be the

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,070
thing to hold that up so we didn't have

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,810
the luxury of waiting we didn't have the

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,870
luxury of saying okay well you're gonna

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,480
have your architecture done and you know

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,519
March we'll just wait until then like we

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,700
had to start moving and so we saw a

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,220
pretty big overlap with you know our UX

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,660
and design process starting and even dev

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,990
starting with some of these key

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,550
decisions so we like had to really

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,140
closely work together to figure out like

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,269
what are the pieces that we can identify

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,910
now and what are the pieces that we can

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:16,310
start moving and then just hope that

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,680
they all sync up and we're giving this

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:24,920
presentation so spoiler alert it syncs

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,519
up so so this was our context during

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,910
discovery

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:34,070
we knew that product conversion was the

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:35,630
top priority and Chelsea also brought to

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,430
us information that like even though

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,770
there were some issues with the current

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,990
website it still was a pretty reasonable

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,010
conversion tool right so there was a

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:49,339
level of conversion that we you know we

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,870
didn't want to decrease on that was that

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,209
was sort of a risk changing things

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,610
without really knowing how these changes

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,740
are going to affect the conversion that

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:01,220
they are were experiencing at the get-go

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,870
so this is our context and if you you

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,940
know gone through some kind of technical

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,610
discovery like this or even on the

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,770
business side thinking of like you know

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,180
what does the product architecture look

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,640
like what do I what is our business

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:16,220
model look like some of these questions

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,040
are probably things that would fly

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,510
through your mind like do products exist

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,240
in a hierarchy do they belong to

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:26,000
categories are there sub products do or

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,279
their inner relational relationships

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,870
between them how are these presented how

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,089
are they represented the menu etc etc

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,870
etc right all of these questions come up

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,890
and typically in a discovery process to

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,510
build out some sort of tool to model

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,850
businesses product architecture we need

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,310
to have answers for all these questions

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,560
and we didn't have answers for any of

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:54,170
them so we needed to take a step back

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,750
and kind of create a project plan that

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,210
looked a little bit different from some

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,580
project plans on previous previous

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,950
projects it was becoming evident to us

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,120
that there were more unknowns and

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:10,670
variables almost than requirements so we

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,010
started taking those variables and and

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,380
treating them almost like defined like

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,870
requirements defining those variables

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,790
and keeping track of those variables

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,560
just as much as the features the

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,880
explicit features that the client is

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:29,360
telling us that they need so this kind

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,400
of brought us to the point where we were

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,580
thinking that we really needed to start

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,740
out with an MVP we needed to start out

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,480
with the simplest possible version of

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:43,580
what this product architecture could

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,610
look like at lunch and then know that we

00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,700
are going to refactor this like plan for

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,290
a refactor that comes in three months

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,650
after launch maybe two months after

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,680
launch when these acquisitions come in

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:59,270
when all of the surrounding information

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,220
changes and when we can come back to

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,470
these requirements so we started with

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,720
something very simple and we started

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,090
with something that we were planning to

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,860
change and planning to rebuild so that

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,300
gave us some really important context

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,240
for how to how to think about this

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,010
project at this point moving forward

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,090
with the MVP knowing we were going to

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:21,920
change and from the client relationship

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,290
perspective I said earlier that we've

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,260
been really lucky to work with

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:29,030
technology focused companies and I think

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,950
in this case when there were so many

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,650
variables and we were talking about this

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:36,140
concept of an MVP to have a client like

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,360
Chelsea and her team who understood that

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,220
concept and understood that even when we

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,010
launched this thing it can be refactored

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,720
it can be built on and that enabled us

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:50,480
to make quick decisions and have that

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,310
kind of communication that we needed so

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,940
this kind of brings us to the beginning

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:58,040
of our implementation strategy for how

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,880
we were going to model this product

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,910
architecture Drupal we started to

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,610
leverage some of Drupal's Drupal's

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,220
patterns that that it sets up in a way

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,530
that was going to help us in the future

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,970
think about refactoring think about

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,480
think about these features on an

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,450
individual level we wanted to implement

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,400
the items that were responsible for the

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,050
content architecture in self-contained

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,120
features because we knew we were

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,490
probably going to have to remove and

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,100
replace this entire feature at some

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,320
point in the near future so it's you

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,720
know being really mindful to not create

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,800
a lot of interdependent elements that

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,600
are totally dependent on other parts of

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,030
the code so from a technical point of

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,690
view making modules very concise and

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,970
very purposeful and separating different

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,790
pieces of functionality across different

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,510
modules so individual functionality

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,620
could easily be swapped on replaced

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,320
another thing that was really important

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,800
with our initial implementation was the

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,850
data a lot of times with a CMS for some

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,440
of the people who maybe are a little

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,560
more technical here or have gone through

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,590
an entire project the data is the thing

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,930
that's hard to change right so being

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,060
really cognizant of how we how we're

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,490
using data and how we're modeling these

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,800
behaviors with data so when it needs to

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,890
change will be in a positive place to

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,960
change it so essentially plan for our

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,080
variables and at this point our variable

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:35,690
was we're gonna have to rip this out and

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:37,460
rebuild it at some point soon so we're

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,980
gonna get and this is gonna be the most

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,770
technical part of of this conversation

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,110
but we're gonna get into a little bit in

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:48,020
terms of exactly what we built for

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:51,530
handling modeling this product hierarchy

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:55,370
and what the what the story of this

00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,350
specific feature was so essentially this

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,220
is just a screenshot of the main

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:08,360
navigation at launch and you can see we

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:10,970
have our top-level navigate helix ALM in

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,459
the navigation so we decided to

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,160
you use the main navigation the main

00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:18,620
menu in Drupal as the source of all of

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,509
the relationships all of the content

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,810
relationships on the site so we have

00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:28,790
products and sub pages which in the next

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,310
slide we can see like this this red box

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,139
all the products have landing pages that

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,410
kind of behaved like micro sites and

00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:38,329
then the pages in the sub nav beneath

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,550
are just the items that were in the main

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,680
menu main menu below that main

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,170
navigation items so we were taking

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,500
advantage of using one item in Drupal

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:52,129
the main menu to model out a lot of

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,500
functionality this was easy it made it

00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:56,689
simple for like a content admin on

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,730
Chelsea's side to create a new page

00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,790
click a button that says show sub

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,339
navigation it was not flexible right so

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,709
we were balancing the easiest solution

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,970
that wasn't flexible because at this

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,459
point we didn't know what the

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,040
flexibility was that we needed to plan

00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:15,290
for so there was no complex behavior

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,610
here and this worked for us and it

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:22,000
worked for Chelsea's team at lunch and

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:25,490
for a short amount of time after lunch

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,019
but quickly like Chelsea was talking

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,480
about there were more products there

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,850
were more product lines and there were a

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,379
lot more special cases where this simple

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:38,000
implementation wouldn't suffice so the

00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,610
site launched and everything was going

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,850
great and then we heard from Chelsea and

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:48,110
July and she said we have this top

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:51,250
secret project Nordic sounds awesome

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:54,259
and they so they had acquired a new

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,089
business that had to launch on the site

00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,970
in September so we had to figure out how

00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:00,740
we were going to adjust the nav she also

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,050
said and we all have another acquisition

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,049
in the works but we don't have all the

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:10,039
details about it yet can't really tell

00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:12,860
you yet but plan for it so now we need

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,500
to scale the architecture of the site

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,900
and the navigation accordingly both

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,819
horizontally so moving into additional

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,000
product categories as well as vertically

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,430
so adding on products within the exist

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,439
category so now we have some more

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:31,490
specific requirements that we can work

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,400
with so this is just like another visual

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,950
representation of the problem that we

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,680
had at hand and and what we were trying

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,470
to account for so initially at lunch we

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,390
had our like Tier one item being the

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,490
products page and then our tier two

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,380
items were all the products and you can

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,020
see our Tier three items where the the

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,950
page is underneath in the sub nav so any

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,740
any subordinate pages but then as time

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,630
went on products started to have

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,400
different responsibilities sometimes

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,890
products would be nested underneath

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,560
products so helix RM would be nested

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,140
underneath helix ALM new product lines

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,690
had totally new unexpected behaviors

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,100
that that destroyed this kind of

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,600
architecture structure even more so so

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:23,300
we needed to build something that was a

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:27,590
lot more flexible than this so our

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:30,740
solution at this point has kind of a - a

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:35,690
two part - two steps to it essentially

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:37,250
we have the data side of things and we

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,130
have the implementation side of things

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:44,030
so first we needed to decouple the

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:46,400
products of nav from the actual menu so

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,070
decouple the data architecture like I

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,230
mentioned before all of the content that

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,650
Chelsea's team would actually enter in

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,230
that that was supporting this feature

00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:00,350
was tracked in the main navigation so

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:03,500
that wasn't that wasn't supporting this

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:06,500
new functionality anymore and we needed

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,930
to have relationships on an individual

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,360
node level an individual page level so

00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:14,950
we changed the single source of this

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,170
from the menu down to node relationships

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,120
so that was pretty easy because we had

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,000
it all in one place and then we decided

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,270
to change it to another since we built

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,730
this component initially as one custom

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,550
block in one module just with just one

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:34,620
thing we could build a new thing that we

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:38,370
could just swap out and replace it with

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:41,130
so we we included one new component and

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,500
one change to the data model and it was

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,150
a pretty seamless deployment because we

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,789
could just push up that new component

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,470
then Chelsea's team had access to new

00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,740
tools that they could create new

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:56,750
relationships and the the feature was

00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:00,029
changed the entire data model behind the

00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:05,970
product architecture was swapped out for

00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:08,490
a different one so this is some screen

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,679
grabs of the current navigation and as

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,179
you can see it looks pretty similar

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,770
right

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:16,260
visually it's not that different but

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,480
structurally from like behind the scenes

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,360
with Drupal it's built totally

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,630
differently because these two items no

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,600
longer are related at all the one of the

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,730
main needs was the main navigation

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,669
needed to be a totally arbitrary visual

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,010
presentation of of their data what they

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:37,260
want to push which products they want to

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,149
push how they want to show those kind of

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,240
visual relationships that might not

00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:44,610
necessarily relate directly to their

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,980
business models so now they have a main

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:50,100
navigation that is totally customizable

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,690
and totally flexible they could place

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,940
items wherever they need to place it

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,919
they can configure the visual

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,220
presentations in any way they need as

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,309
well and then the sub nav is based on a

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,860
new relationship that we added so now we

00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:08,640
have a fully featured component with a

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:15,090
complex implementation that actually

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:17,820
targets the client's needs so in terms

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:21,809
of the outcome from the technical side

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,789
of things the project side we spent a

00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:26,490
lot of time defining the unknowns and

00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:28,679
defining the variables and we knew at

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,770
the beginning of the project that if we

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,390
tried to build a fully-featured

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,610
solution at this point it wasn't gonna

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,679
work because we were going to just be

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,270
building on assumptions and not building

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,669
on what the client actually needed and

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:46,890
this allowed us to have a very clean

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:48,240
post-launch refactor into a piece of

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,170
functionality that

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,880
is very targeted to the clients needs

00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,410
yeah I really think the product menu is

00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,210
a great example of how this site was

00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:02,640
built for scale so today the web team

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,800
can adjust our product menu and our

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,900
product page hierarchy very quickly very

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,190
easily and business lines can really

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,200
display the dependencies and

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,140
relationships between products however

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,170
they want to so an example of that is

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,700
our helix aniline product suite we have

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,800
three individual components and you can

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,630
buy each of those separately or you can

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,130
buy the whole suite as one and so it was

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,220
important to us to be able to convey

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,320
that relationship both in the menu and

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,490
then also on those individual product

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,370
pages and I think we were very

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:37,950
successful at doing that so the second

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,990
requirement for the website was to make

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,110
sure that it was flexible we talked

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,809
about that a little bit but as I

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,030
mentioned previously the way that our

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:49,980
d-7 site was built every single update

00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:53,640
even small copy changes had to go

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,500
through the web developer and even worse

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,500
if we wanted to make a new page it was

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,720
like custom built template made from

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,960
scratch and so it became this huge

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:11,700
bottleneck for us and we were literally

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:14,429
waiting weeks just to make changes yeah

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,740
so ultimately our second goal with

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:19,770
flexibility was just to create this

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,929
system that would make the developers

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,360
and the content admins we want to make

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:25,920
their day-to-day jobs easier that's the

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,300
ultimate goal we want to give them kind

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,890
of a toolbox of complex components and

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,400
different pieces that they can put

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:37,710
together to create pages and then really

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,150
free up that developer to create new

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:45,929
features and improve the site ongoing

00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:49,140
and we have a couple more oh he showed

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:51,540
up differently so with response to this

00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,110
request from from Chelsea we were really

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:57,900
excited because this kind of was a

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,550
totally total you know three 180 from

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,020
what we were

00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,240
talking about before with a lot of

00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,930
unknowns this is the kind of situation

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,860
that Drupal is really great at

00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:12,020
flexibility is what Drupal does best and

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:15,320
building out complicated data structures

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:19,130
and deep data structures is is something

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,260
that that Drupal really excels at and it

00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,930
just so happens that well-defined well

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,690
structured data is essential for

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:30,890
building modular and flexible component

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:35,120
based design systems so Drupal can build

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:37,280
very deep and very flexible systems for

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,090
users to use and give users a lot of

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,390
power

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:47,150
Drupal loves component based design and

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:51,860
atomic design structures so well-defined

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:54,160
content is easy to manage when content

00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,020
types have well does well-defined

00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,630
responsibilities they have very clear

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,970
intentions then it's easy for content

00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:05,720
admins to know exactly what they need to

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:08,420
do to target content updates or create

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,080
new functionality or new portions of the

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:15,820
site it's empowers content admins to

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,410
create some very complex components we

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,340
created some custom theming on the back

00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:24,050
end to kind of make paragraphs component

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,840
based content editing a little more

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:29,600
straightforward and clean and some of

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,460
the components that content admins were

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,520
able to use allowed them to build very

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:39,280
complex data structures on the front end

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:42,140
things like tabs or complex sliders or

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,110
referencing content from other parts of

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,470
the web sites all of this became pretty

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:51,260
trivial to a Content admin we were able

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,590
to use atomic design to create a very

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:57,320
flexible content system that also can be

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,480
modified and extended in the future very

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,370
easily so we created a lot of

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,500
flexibility that really empowered the

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,330
content admins to do what they need to

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,789
do and

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:12,730
to build and create entirely new

00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:17,289
experiences on the website nice we got

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:19,149
the emoji here so we've talked about the

00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:22,809
role before of content admins and

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:26,320
developers so after we built this new d8

00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:28,899
site we've really optimized what their

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,390
day-to-day roles are so content admins

00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:33,070
are no longer beholden to the developer

00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,260
if they want to make a small change they

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,809
have this toolbox of components to

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,370
really get creative with making new page

00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,950
layouts and when you're a company like

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:45,340
perforce that has acquisitions and new

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,649
products they need that flexibility and

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,110
then you have a developer who is no

00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:52,419
longer just creating new page templates

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,740
or doing content entry tasks they're

00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:55,389
able to really look at the site

00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,820
holistically and think how can we

00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:59,980
improve this at a higher level so

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,960
they're high-fiving each other they're

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:08,950
working together and they're their roles

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:10,659
together are optimized so this this

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,880
flexibility was really put to the test

00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:16,659
with the launch of a new product called

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:21,809
helix team hub which the logo is not

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:25,059
there Oh lovely

00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:27,010
so team hub was a different product for

00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,570
us instead of focusing on large scale

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,750
development and enterprise companies it

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:33,789
focused more on the mid tier team hub is

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,909
a git hosting and code repository tool

00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:38,649
but it also supports artifacts and so we

00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,450
needed these project pages to have a

00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:43,029
slightly different look and feel than

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:47,799
the rest of our website with different

00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:50,350
layouts and really highlighting the GUI

00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,029
of this product we were directly

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,090
competing with established leaders like

00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,620
github and get lab but unlike github and

00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,480
get lab team hub allows you to store

00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,460
your artifacts alongside your code and

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,889
you can also have multiple git

00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,779
repositories within a single project so

00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:07,000
this gives you a single source of truth

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:08,620
as you're trying to scale as your

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,279
products growing complexity or as your

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,279
repos grow

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,070
thank you oh I'm sorry I thought we had

00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,600
if he's like anyways um so basically not

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,580
only where our content he was able to

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,530
build these new pages really really

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,210
quickly but we we had a very short time

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:36,360
to launch this product and we got it

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:39,600
done in days instead of in weeks so this

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,040
brings us to our third sort of challenge

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,940
that we were working through for this

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,350
project and that was reliability and so

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,720
jus pilate's been around now for a

00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:51,780
couple years and on and I'm sure we've

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,200
all kind of heard some of these new new

00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,960
things that Drupal II bring to the table

00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:02,490
but it definitely does create a new

00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,650
foundation for building Drupal so we

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,150
asked ìiî to make sure that the website

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,490
they built was going to be something

00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,580
that our small web team could sustain

00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,750
and maintain on their own we also wanted

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,030
to make sure that it was going to be

00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,040
easy for new team members to learn how

00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:19,470
to make these content updates and then

00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,270
even if a beginner content admin is

00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,190
going to the site they could make these

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,190
changes without worrying about messing

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,510
up the rest of the website we wanted

00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:30,540
them to be able to make SEO updates

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,280
easily and then most importantly really

00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,680
give their website visitors so our

00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,360
customers and new prospects a consistent

00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:42,960
experience every time they visited the

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:46,890
website so our goal here was to empower

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,950
pro forces in-house developers marketing

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:52,740
teams content admins to be able to

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,670
manage update and build their Drupal 8

00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:00,810
application completely on their own

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:02,820
consistently so these are some of the

00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,620
things that are probably buzzwords that

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,300
have that have come up a lot if you're a

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,920
little less familiar with Drupal you

00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,290
probably have heard these things talked

00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,580
about it if you're using Drupal 8 then

00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,590
you probably are pretty familiar with

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,570
these but on the left side

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,910
things like composer configuration

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:21,210
management on the release cycle are all

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:23,520
really important new aspects to using

00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,290
Drupal when Drupal 8 came out composer

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,020
lets you

00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,270
manage your assets a lot more explicitly

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,160
and lets you leverage completely

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,740
unrelated PHP libraries in a much more

00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,100
standard way like the rest of the PHP

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,290
community does so it's a it's a lot

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,290
easier to manage your project using

00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:46,350
composer than in Drupal 7 which is was

00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:49,230
essentially just a big a big repo of all

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:51,840
of your stuff configuration management

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,550
lets you deploy specific features

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,140
through code instead of through the

00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,450
database so when we were talking about

00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,120
our refactor our product architecture

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:03,360
refactor that was a totally seamless

00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,240
deployment it was a push a config import

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,790
and in about five minutes that feature

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,390
was on production ready for Chelsea's

00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:15,030
team to jump in change content edit

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,340
content it was it was kind of a flawless

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,110
deployment it was one of our this was a

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,790
while ago this was one of our first

00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,070
triple-eight sites and it was one of the

00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:26,730
first large features that I personally

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:29,460
like deployed on Drupal 8 and it was it

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,140
was amazing how how smooth it was so

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,240
that was like a really satisfying thing

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:37,590
from my side from the development point

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,690
of view and then we wanted to to kind of

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,030
present some positive get workflow

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,280
patterns these aren't you know really

00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:46,890
specifically related to Drupal but give

00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,750
a good structure for them to take and to

00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:51,180
start using on their internal team and

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,240
give them you know good good patterns

00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,520
good best practices to follow and then

00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,270
the release cycle with Drupal 8 is

00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:02,700
really important because now with Drupal

00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,800
8 every every minor release is adding

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,560
some new functionality and then effect

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,710
eventually a minor release will bring

00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,770
Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 right so if you're

00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,630
new web project your new web system is

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,000
built in Drupal 8 and is really

00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,610
thoroughly planned out and well thought

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,040
out you may never have to rebuild your

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,020
system right Drupal 8 will be updated

00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,310
eventually it'll be updated to Drupal 9

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,830
and that'll keep going

00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:31,590
you can have one rebuild now that is

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,300
essentially your web platform for the

00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,700
foreseeable future there's not going to

00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,130
be like any hard updates that require a

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,350
hard rebuild

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,660
and then on the project level these are

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:45,210
a little less you know a little a little

00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,120
more softer things that we implemented

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:51,240
but we really leveraged Drupal's ability

00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:55,950
to do modular content that's what Drupal

00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:00,090
really excels at so we we aligned sass

00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:02,850
Styles JavaScript templates all up with

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,040
the way Drupal handles these component

00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,400
based entities so we had kind of strict

00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,200
rules about how templates are built how

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,590
style sheets are built and then we were

00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,530
able to hopefully pass this off to the

00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:18,240
client-side in the future and maybe they

00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:28,860
would keep using these patterns that was

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:30,870
that was the intended idea yeah so one

00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,510
thing that was kind of unusual about

00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:36,420
this project and one of the coolest

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,280
things I think is that after working on

00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,580
the site for so long

00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,070
Anthony really intimately knew the site

00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,410
and what kind of in-house developer

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:50,040
would be needed to support the ongoing

00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:53,610
maintenance and updates to the site so

00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:57,300
we actually helped with hiring for perf

00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:00,960
forces new developer we developed a code

00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:03,360
test we did code reviews and I think

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,190
that we were just really invested in

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,550
knowing that this product that we had

00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:11,040
built was going to be well maintained

00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:14,250
and so you know it ended up working

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,159
really well Anthony made a lot of guides

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:19,260
to the site that the developer perforce

00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,870
was very invested in learning about the

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,889
patterns that we had established and

00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:29,190
working within within those constraints

00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:32,370
and so we had an ongoing phase 2 project

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,260
the image on the right is is what our

00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,260
asana project looked like so we were

00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,649
really cranking through a lot of tasks

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,330
together Anthony and / forces developer

00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:45,480
were on slack they were just very very

00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:47,610
collaborative and for me as an

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,880
accountant project manager that's really

00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,770
the dream that

00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:55,510
the developers are working that well

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:58,090
together so that's a huge success story

00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,620
for us and one of the things that I

00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,760
think went really well and the

00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:05,470
reliability of the product that we built

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,820
so this is this is Jeremy and I working

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,310
together we look we look pretty similar

00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:16,720
Jeremy may or may not be in this room

00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:18,070
his identity he's yellow though yeah so

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,530
that was really cool like that they were

00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:23,740
just really working together that well

00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:26,020
yeah and so Jeremy came out after the

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,900
site was lunch and we were working

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,350
together on a lot of post launch updates

00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,720
new features QA that kind of thing and

00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,790
gradually over a period of maybe about

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,180
six months maybe less I can't totally

00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:42,340
remember but the amount that that I was

00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,970
doing was decreasing in the amount that

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,860
Jeremy was doing was increasing and we

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:51,250
got to the point where we had a pretty

00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,460
complete transition where the project

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,800
now is perforce his project and they're

00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,680
doing pretty much the majority of the

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,720
maintenance

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,910
so that's Chelsea being really happy and

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:09,160
that's Jeremy being cool with sunglasses

00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:11,530
on because he's awesome yeah so just

00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,540
basically III really delivered

00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,870
they built a website that pretty much

00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:18,280
put them out of a job and you know to

00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,780
their credit they were willing to do

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:26,080
that and we were just really happy with

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:28,240
the end result so since the launch the

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,080
website metrics have continued to

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,800
impress traffic has gone up every

00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,260
quarter in 2017 so from Q 1 to Q 4 of

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,870
2017 total traffic increased by two

00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,940
hundred and forty nine percent our

00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:46,030
international traffic from Q 1 to Q four

00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,830
went up by four hundred percent and then

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:50,530
our blog traffic this is primarily

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,540
organic and so it represents new

00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,160
prospects for us and it's an important

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,860
driver of new prospects to our website

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,710
and then increased by 33% and a lot of

00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,850
that was driven by SEO updates that our

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:04,190
content admins were able to make now

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:10,430
much more quickly and in a much more

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:13,250
agile manner and then as as Jeremy

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,950
mentioned even though the old d7 sites

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,050
had problems ironically it was a very

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:20,870
strong lead gen channel for us it was

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,090
our most important one so not disrupting

00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:26,840
lead gen was paramount to this launch

00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:30,230
and this represents our web-based leads

00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,150
for every quarter in 2017 so we've seen

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,160
our web-based leads increase and then

00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:36,740
our conversion rate on the website of

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,650
visitors to leads has increased as well

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,960
so at the end of q4 we're at a four

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,730
point one percent conversion rate now in

00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,990
2018 were at a five percent conversion

00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:53,750
rate and we have a goal to get it up to

00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:56,780
seven percent so just to kind of bring

00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,840
everything back together we had a couple

00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,360
I would say the most important things

00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,570
that we took from this project a couple

00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,100
of really big takeaways just kind of

00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:09,230
reading this straight from the slide but

00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,660
don't try to solve the problems that

00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:14,440
can't be answered yet that was a really

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:19,010
really important thing a lot of times

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,830
maybe it's easy to to feel just

00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,810
pressured by by the situation or the

00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:26,300
client like we have to we have to have a

00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,620
solution and then based on what you know

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,570
you just make one up

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,910
and then you build something and then

00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,560
that thing that's a bill isn't actually

00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,510
doing what the client needs to do or

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,300
what the clients expecting because there

00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,940
wasn't enough information to to figure

00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,310
out what they really wanted so tracking

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,630
the unknowns and the variables became

00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:48,620
just as important as tracking

00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:52,100
requirements and targeting MVP over

00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:54,560
guesswork became really really clear in

00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:57,230
this project specifically because the

00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,110
example and the case study the case that

00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:02,090
we had with this showed how how much

00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:05,750
that provided a better tool for the

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:07,970
client and these these can be hard

00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,770
conversations like one thing that Kate

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,840
mentioned a lot of these conversations

00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,700
were easy with perforce because they

00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,130
were they were a tech company

00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,470
idea of what an MVP is or what

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,240
refactoring means all of those things

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:24,730
were inherent in their vocabulary

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,740
already so that's definitely a really

00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:30,770
really thing that made this a lot easier

00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,510
for us and so those conversations might

00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,600
be harder to have with some clients

00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:37,730
right but ultimately demonstrating the

00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,880
value that this is going to return back

00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:44,240
to their project or their system or the

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,790
money it's going to save has shown to be

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,060
a clear way to kind of talk about it or

00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:52,610
or to talk through this process even if

00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:57,170
the technical part is not as easily

00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:58,490
understood by the client so the second

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,800
the second kind of take away would be

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,660
always build like you're going to tear

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,610
it apart

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:07,280
investing extra time into properly

00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:10,520
building functionality in a

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,980
componentized manner it's definitely

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,680
gonna pay out in terms of time for you

00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:19,550
the technical team and in terms of money

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,530
for the client-side team especially if

00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,630
you want a project that's going to live

00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:26,900
and grow with your business it has to be

00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,510
built to be able to do that and the

00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,820
immediate refactor of it in an entire

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,190
portion of the website arguably one of

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,200
the most important parts of it happening

00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:42,140
right after lunch and being successful

00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:46,510
is a testament to this this is everyone

00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,510
smiling together at the end

00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:57,310
awesome so yeah that concludes our

00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:01,150
presentation where we're gonna have a

00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,680
little bit of time for Q&A and if you

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,030
want to come up and talk to us that

00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,910
would be great

00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,820
so I hope you learned something I hope

00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,560
that if you're embarking on a website

00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,500
project or in the middle of one that

00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,290
you're inspired to make sure that it's

00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,050
scalable flexible and reliable and apply

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,730
some of these best practices to your

00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,580
site

00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:28,330
elevated third where a sponsor of Drupal

00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:30,670
con this year we have a booth 3:06 if

00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,380
you go into the the main hall it's right

00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,720
to the left so we would love if you

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:39,220
would stop by and say hello and meet

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,500
some of the rest of our team yeah thank

00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:48,059
you

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:48,059
[Applause]

00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:10,050
yes so we did talk about it a little bit

00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:13,380
initially and then eventually perforce

00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:15,990
did end up using the aqueous

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,300
personalization product and but that's

00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:21,210
something that they are working into the

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,640
project now so the sort of component

00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:26,810
based content system is kind of allowing

00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,340
them to create these new blocks and and

00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:32,940
just integrate into aqueous lift

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,800
platform that functionality of you know

00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,300
swapping out content replacing content

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,890
and so I know they're just kind of

00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:43,710
starting up the campaigns now yeah so if

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,810
you guys have used aqua lifts before the

00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,280
way it works is the first couple months

00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:49,080
it's kind of a ramp up period where they

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,050
are collecting data from your current

00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,520
website visitors and then from that data

00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,130
you can create segments and then you

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,390
personalized as Anthony said certain

00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,520
blocks on your website and so that's

00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:03,050
something that we're hoping to roll out

00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,050
this May / June yeah

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:14,640
any other questions okay cool thank you

00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,640
