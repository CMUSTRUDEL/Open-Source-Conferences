Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Printing in your Language: Leveraging Drupal’s multilingual features
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	At Princess Cruises, we’ve invested heavily in Drupal as the CMS backbone for our onboard guest experience application, Princess@Sea.  It houses a large amount of content for the ship, from events to restaurant menus, in 9 languages.

While we have invested heavily into Digital, we also have a lot of printed collateral including our daily onboard newsletter that we create, print, and distribute to 3000 passengers onboard.  Additionally a lot of this printed material is generated to support our non english speaking guests.  Traditionally this was generated and translated as needed by an onboard translator.  Extending this model to our fleet of 17 ships and for each supported language was not a feasible long term solution. We knew there must be some way to utilize the content and translations in our Drupal based application.

To solve this problem, we built a decoupled Angular application, Canvas, that leverages all the data and translations we have in Drupal with some advanced layout and content flow options to generate our onboard newsletter, the Princess Patter.

In this session, we’ll walk through the Canvas application and walk through the content creation, management, translation and scheduling that goes into producing our printed material onboard.
