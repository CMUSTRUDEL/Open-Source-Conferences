Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Printing in your Language: Leveraging Drupal’s multilingual features
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	At Princess Cruises, we’ve invested heavily in Drupal as the CMS backbone for our onboard guest experience application, Princess@Sea.  It houses a large amount of content for the ship, from events to restaurant menus, in 9 languages.

While we have invested heavily into Digital, we also have a lot of printed collateral including our daily onboard newsletter that we create, print, and distribute to 3000 passengers onboard.  Additionally a lot of this printed material is generated to support our non english speaking guests.  Traditionally this was generated and translated as needed by an onboard translator.  Extending this model to our fleet of 17 ships and for each supported language was not a feasible long term solution. We knew there must be some way to utilize the content and translations in our Drupal based application.

To solve this problem, we built a decoupled Angular application, Canvas, that leverages all the data and translations we have in Drupal with some advanced layout and content flow options to generate our onboard newsletter, the Princess Patter.

In this session, we’ll walk through the Canvas application and walk through the content creation, management, translation and scheduling that goes into producing our printed material onboard.

all right thank you for showing up this

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,730
is our presentation printing in your

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,250
language levering it leveraging of

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:16,109
Drupal's multilingual features but first

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,390
it was a very exciting day for all of

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,510
you very very exciting we're gonna

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,199
announce a brand new digital products

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,869
for ships so you'll be the first group

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,980
to really see this unveil that's right

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm just thrilled let me tell you a

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,090
little bit about it it is a hundred

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,629
percent recyclable it gets fantastic

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,090
battery life and it's super super cheap

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,379
to produce and now I'm gonna show it to

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,620
you if you're ready are you guys ready

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:57,420
alright here it is

00:00:51,620 --> 00:01:00,840
it's a printed piece of paper you know

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,030
which is kind of really when you think

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,949
about digital and digital transformation

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,689
and digital products and Drupal and

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,650
content management group oh we think

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,240
about screens and we definitely do

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,939
screens we run a product called

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,619
presidency on our ships and it is our

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,680
guest experience platform it's based on

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,369
Drupal Drupal runs on each one of our 17

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,130
vessels we deliver a ton of information

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,939
to our guests via this via their mobile

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,460
phone or their laptop or digital signage

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,689
but we've also started delivering that

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,720
same content that same data to what has

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,450
traditionally been our daily onboard

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,640
newsletter which shows basically every

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,920
single event that happens on board as

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,189
advertisements has information about the

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,030
ports are going to about people that are

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,280
you know the captain the most traveled

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,820
passenger hours of operation for all of

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,630
our stuff and originally we would built

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,909
our products to essentially replace this

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,409
but this piece of paper holds a lot of

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,540
value to our passengers

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:15,780
is a physical like takeaway of their

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,549
time on board the ship and it's free but

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,319
it is like a big memento for them so

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,819
they'll collect all of these for

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,080
everyday we print them every day on

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:29,190
board but as we went down this journey

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,920
of kind of digital transformation and

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,140
went down this creating this guest

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,480
experience app and put Drupal out on the

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,599
ships and Drupal is kind of our content

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,069
hub for essentially everything we do on

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,049
board nowadays we really embraced the

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:49,640
concept of you know create once publish

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:54,120
everywhere so while a first product was

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,940
princess at sea it's now expanded quite

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,040
a bit so one piece of content like say

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,079
an event that's scheduled in a location

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,200
can be reutilized

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:06,629
throughout our guests experience

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,930
platform can be in digital signage can

00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:16,139
be used in the case of like ours or or

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,970
or menu items can be repurposed for use

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:23,209
in back-end systems front-end systems

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,209
and this stuff here printed material

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,970
it's now Hillary is time so see a Drupal

00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,010
is kind of the center of everything so

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,810
we create content once and then you're

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,330
publishing it everywhere which is sort

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,159
of how everything is done on the ship so

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,080
not only like Nate said is that in one

00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,459
place and land but this isn't sort of a

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,200
harsh environment where it's on board a

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,269
ship where we have satellite

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,190
connectivity it's not constant internet

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,620
connection you know it's it's a

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,060
difficult situation in some cases and I

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,549
need to these ships we actually have a

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,310
print shop so there's a full operating

00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,260
print shop on all 17 ships producing all

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,510
sorts of collateral that's required to

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,459
go to the rooms including the princess

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,109
patter which is that day's the daily

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,500
newsletter that'll go to each of the

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:11,530
stateroom cabins every morning and then

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,540
to add to the complexity our passengers

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,180
come from all over the world so they're

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,829
speaking any number of languages

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,289
princess at sea is currently served in

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,449
Drupal in nine different languages the

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,729
ninth language being English so we have

00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,470
to service not only all of our guests in

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,120
all different languages the princess at

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,900
sea which we can do easily with Drupal

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,030
multilingual but now we need to serve

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,010
that in print so in the past when we

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,410
serve that in print you can see this is

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,389
our original princess patter you can see

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,700
it's the guests experience is not quite

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,889
the same as for our English passengers

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,200
which is sort of an afterthought and and

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,960
it's not really fitting with our brand

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,180
guidelines we don't really want to have

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,510
that perception to our to our guests I'm

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,599
born and this is also our process before

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,490
it's just a bit complex you can see

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,710
there's a lot of a lot of redundancy

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,389
there's a printer on board whose role it

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,280
is to gather all this information from

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,440
all different departments there's

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,000
actually people physically walking the

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,220
different parts of the ship to get

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,960
content from these different areas and

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,479
then bringing them to the printers that

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,770
you can put together this newsletter the

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,180
newsletter then goes through a whole

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,430
bunch of different approval processes

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,169
there's a separate person building the

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,330
multilingual version of the pattern so

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,780
there's sort of a kind of a disconnected

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,909
experience there for guests so it's just

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,719
really complex

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:36,759
and it was all done it was all done with

00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:39,459
InDesign so it was copy paste so

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,779
basically you know one of the challenges

00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,629
we've always had is that to make sure

00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:45,789
that content is identical no matter what

00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,189
touch point somebody had so we spent a

00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,709
lot of effort in our digital platforms

00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:53,229
to consolidate this but none of that was

00:05:50,709 --> 00:06:00,339
really being realized for our paper

00:05:53,229 --> 00:06:03,639
printed process so then after we've kind

00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:06,159
of moved this digital the advantages we

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,199
had of digitizing this princess that see

00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,149
all of our content in Drupal why not

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:15,569
move that same content into our print

00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:18,729
processes so we have a digital we have a

00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:20,469
event scheduling system on board instead

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,599
of copying pasting some of that content

00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:25,029
into our digital newsletter when we feed

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,129
that into princess at sea that content

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,599
then goes out to lingotek where it gets

00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,179
professionally translated into all of

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,659
our different languages all this content

00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:35,889
is stored in one content hub and it's

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:39,009
it's a consistent experience then

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,309
throughout all 17 ships I mean it goes

00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,779
down to our application we've developed

00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:46,119
which is a decoupled application called

00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:48,189
canvas it's built with angular front-end

00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,899
and it's a print layout application so

00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:52,089
we're using this now instead of InDesign

00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,729
so this application automatically feeds

00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:56,379
in all of our content in English same

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,119
content that's being published to the

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,550
guests on their mobile devices they can

00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:02,740
now consume that same content in this

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,869
printed form and that goes into an

00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,999
onboard printing press and then the

00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:09,099
patters can be pushed out in both

00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:11,169
English and then any of the eight

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:13,419
languages that we need to produce it in

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:16,029
and one of the you know one of the

00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,959
primary motivators here was that I mean

00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:22,269
as you saw in the the screen before the

00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,459
multilingual version of this definitely

00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,889
did not look like this and it looked

00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:30,689
like in it definitely looked like an

00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,610
inferior product so

00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:34,319
a big motivator was to make sure that

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,409
none of our guests feel like they're

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,360
getting any different level of service

00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:40,979
no matter what language they speak so if

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,649
we could create a process that not only

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,249
simplified what we are doing but also

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,959
standardize what we are doing then you

00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:51,089
know be a benefit from everyone we could

00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,249
deliver the exact same experience to

00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,249
every single guest on board

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,610
so with that we'll show you a quick demo

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,480
of canvas so you can see what that looks

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,480
like

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,720
so this is

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,039
canvas you can see it looks sort of like

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,289
our princess patterns in the earlier

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,849
slides so all of this content is being

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:22,650
coming is coming in from Web Services

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,360
right

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,550
so you can select the date to begin with

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,460
when you pick the date it automatically

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,020
pulls all of the content from that date

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,240
we've designed a number of different

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,430
templates so we have embarkation days

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,320
see days that the format sort of changes

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,140
you'll see on a sea day for example

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,899
we're gonna pull an image the captain

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,680
but perhaps on embarkation day it's

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,970
going to have a little bit different

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,140
layout so there's a lot of different

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,940
rules that we were following with

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,520
InDesign that we've now built into our

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:55,529
canvas application and it's pretty neat

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,730
we can change all of the different font

00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:02,730
sizes we've set minimum max limits on

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,320
these to make it look just like you

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,740
would an InDesign but there's no

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,720
creating any content manually now we can

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,570
select which content we want to show and

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,200
hide from Drupal and then automatically

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,899
populate it different ads that are

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,980
scheduled for that day we can show and

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,720
hide so we might see these ads in canvas

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,190
and the printed patter but it can also

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,500
go to all different end points right so

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,680
those ads might be served to a digital

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,040
signage system on board or other areas

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,899
of the the ship

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,550
same thing with ours all this

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,140
information is stored in Drupal so we

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,480
can choose which locations which hours

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,980
we want to show and then as you

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,020
mentioned earlier the event scheduling

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,790
system feeds in all the events for the

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,160
day so you'll see all these listed on

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,680
each side of the the inside of the

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,010
patter and all this content is

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,060
maintained in Drupal so all of the api's

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,060
this is talking to you are coming

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,720
directly from Drupal all the

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:08,350
descriptions etc all coming from Jubal

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:19,020
and they're stored in a CouchDB so I can

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:22,180
save this and come back to it later so

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,980
we you know the title of this topic is

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,380
leveraging Drupal is multilingual well

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,870
let's show you how we leveraged Drupal's

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,210
multilingual content so all this this is

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,360
done I've created this piece of paper

00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:36,700
that we're gonna print for our four

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,760
thousand guests on board oh I've got you

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,340
know 25 Chinese passengers who are

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,900
chartered here we're in Alaska they're a

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,660
special group I know that they've

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,970
already requested a Chinese version of

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:53,020
the pattern so me as the printer now or

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,460
Hilary is the printer so you can not

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,370
knowing any simplified Chinese

00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,080
whatsoever I can switch it to Chinese

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,020
and now I have a Chinese version of the

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,180
pattern so I don't have there's no need

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,040
for a separate person who speaks Chinese

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,630
stationed in each of these ships to go

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,580
through and create this pattern manually

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,340
you can see it'll have the same design

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,760
as the English version of the pattern

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,820
and then you can go ahead and save this

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,440
but one of the neat aspects of this like

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I said I don't need to speak Chinese

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,290
so if I'm trying to figure out what

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,720
version of the ad this is and I have no

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,190
idea because I'm a printer the

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,160
configuration options are still all in

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,560
English so I can still configure it just

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,910
like I would the English version of the

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,890
patter we can change sizes just like you

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,240
did before so you can change anything

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,830
you did in the English version as well

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,150
you'll notice a lot of times when we

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,120
switch languages and this happened in

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,040
InDesign as well the length of content

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,150
changes quite a bit so when you switch

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,710
to different languages because of

00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,570
character sizes and stuff like that

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,090
you'll see sometimes you need to resize

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,070
these boxes as well which we can do and

00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,510
then change the font sizes as well the

00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,490
different sizes to get them to fit in

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,310
there

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:06,690
and then from there you can print and

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,190
the shells that we have to print on have

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,250
the headers and stuff like that in there

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,890
so you won't see these but it will print

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,600
the full powder than in any language you

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:22,450
want we can do that in English we can do

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:25,510
that in Chinese so yeah

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:28,360
so the translation it happens in a

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,790
couple different ways so we because this

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,950
is all guest facing it's all human

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:36,010
translated and that's all done through

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:38,050
lingotek as our TMS we also heavily

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,660
leveraged the integration with lingotek

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,579
because it really simplifies the process

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:51,550
of maintaining translations with a

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:54,639
little site so yeah so it's a little bit

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,310
it's very similar we kind of we have a

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,230
master drupal shoreside that lives in

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,440
our office in santa clarita that's

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,790
actually feeding via migrate module and

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,589
api is out to all the different ships

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,690
the content that goes there so the

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:11,320
translation and the lingotek connection

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,149
all live shoreside so content that is

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,269
created shoreside automatically goes to

00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:17,680
lingotek it's translate translation is

00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,779
done there when it's mark completed

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,220
basically automatically comes back into

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,850
Drupal and it's published out to the

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,740
ships on board if they need there's a

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,390
new event that came up and they need to

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,370
create a description for it they can do

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,380
that right in Drupal there they'll

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,790
notify somebody shoreside that hey

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,579
something's coming that needs to be

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:40,449
translated it automatically will migrate

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:42,970
back to our shoreside drupal and then go

00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:44,500
out to lingotek where you know we know

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,060
that there's stuff coming in so we'll

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,070
have somebody ready to do that

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,779
translation within lingotek and then

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,240
it's kind of follows that Sam comes back

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:56,199
in a drupal and that republishes back

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,440
out updates that piece and it's actually

00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:01,690
something interesting to see from a kind

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,910
of a technical standpoint is so this is

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,579
kind of the description in couchdb of

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,050
the patter and you'll see we're

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:11,050
referencing everything here basically

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,589
just by you you IDs so all that content

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,300
is being referenced by one single ID so

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:19,000
no matter what languages in its going to

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,480
pull out the appropriate translation out

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,480
of Drupal

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,790
so using canvas there's a lot of clear

00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:37,009
advantages we noticed right away

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,949
one was in time savings and cost savings

00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:42,499
obviously we saw about 20 collective

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:44,149
hours each day were saved between people

00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:46,249
from all different departments running

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,809
back and forth to do approvals building

00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:49,489
the whole paddle patter kind of that

00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:50,839
redundant workflow where there's a

00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,369
separate person building a separate

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,779
version of the pattern there's somebody

00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:55,759
copying and pasting events from another

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:59,869
system into InDesign there's just a lot

00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:04,579
of redundancy there and that's you know

00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:09,049
20 hours per ship right 7:17 writes 365

00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:10,519
yeah huge savings like I mentioned the

00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,319
international host on board can now

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,209
service those Chinese passengers rather

00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:17,029
than worrying about building this custom

00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:19,189
pad are separate from the what the

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:22,040
printers duties are on top of that we

00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:24,829
also saw increased standardization now

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,920
across the fleet so if everybody on each

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:29,509
ship is using Drupal and the same

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,399
content that's being served to our

00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:34,579
phones and all the other devices that

00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,920
we're consuming this content from is now

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,600
being produced in the printed newsletter

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,249
the same way we're kind of controlling

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,839
that content controlling that experience

00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:44,839
where each guest gets that same

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,610
consistent standardized experience same

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,769
thing with the language tone so each

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,420
host on board would translate it the way

00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:52,189
they thought was the best way to do it

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,720
using lingotek we have professional

00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:55,129
translators we know the tone that we

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,899
want to translate it in and it's

00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,360
consistent across the fleet regardless

00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:04,399
of which ship you're on as a guest and

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,019
then last is a much bigger implication I

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,389
guess that we didn't always think about

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,549
is that it's a live document so if I'm

00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:12,709
the printer and today the dress code

00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:14,980
changed and I didn't get the memo went

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,480
to print there's a lot of issues here if

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,919
if the dress code changes and it's

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,660
coming through live on my document right

00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,040
before print I'm seeing it come through

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,069
because that web service is live my

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,110
document is live another situation that

00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:29,160
happens sometimes if we skip a port so

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,610
bad weather we're going to skip

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,290
a port in the Bahamas we're now gonna

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,120
have a sea day to change the template

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,800
same contents all feeding through

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,300
there's not this whole going InDesign

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,339
get a new template copy and paste all

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,180
the content again you know we save a lot

00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:49,139
of time that way and then also other

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,689
opportunities yeah sure so I mean the

00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,579
canvas application while doing the

00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,629
patter was like our first step in it's

00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,720
actually one of the more complicated

00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:02,730
documents that we create on board print

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:05,130
wise but there's a like we had mentioned

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,880
before there's a ton of printed material

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:11,220
that goes out that can you know really

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,319
benefit from digital transformation and

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,179
the operational side and one of those

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,760
key ones is in particular like

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:22,010
restaurant menus like you see here I'm

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,150
gonna plug my coworker Cebu and Davis's

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,530
presentation tomorrow about what we're

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,569
doing with food and beverage and

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,400
restaurant menu management and all that

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,860
stuff because basically that provides

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,070
another data source that we can pull

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,830
into another template and just in the

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,530
same way have up-to-the-minute

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,240
translated identical versions of printed

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,549
material going out to our guests on

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,030
board no matter what language they speak

00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:50,190
as well as you know port guides and

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:52,020
flyers about specials of the spa and all

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,559
this stuff and we can utilize that cross

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,360
channel and that's kind of what we're

00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,760
thinking of right now is all these

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,570
different end points that we have

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,000
onboard the ship

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,190
we've done some trials of using these

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,590
menus and so on and digital signage as

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,450
well because that is kind of a rough

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,880
thing sometimes finding out the menus

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,890
change everyday in our restaurant venues

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,299
so finding out what's actually for

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,820
dinner tonight is a challenge

00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:20,039
particularly if it's changing and you

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,500
don't speak English as your first

00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:26,520
language you know who knows what you're

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,639
going to be ordering so but then you

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,299
know there's

00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:33,369
video-on-demand systems there's you know

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:34,929
we designed our original app so it work

00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:36,489
on anything with a web browser so

00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,470
essentially anything we have a web

00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:41,919
browser on or or anything that can

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,389
ingest our REST API scan can have an

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,799
interface into this whether it's front

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,799
of the house back of the house whatever

00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:53,830
good we're doing really good on time

00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:55,929
we're really worried about this so we'll

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,279
have time for questions but first these

00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,279
are the people that made all this stuff

00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,690
happen this is our team where the guests

00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,019
experience the application team at

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,830
princess we have teams and offshore and

00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:11,739
both here in the US we are hiring

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,289
so hey please come see me and you'll see

00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:15,700
me with this hat the whole DrupalCon the

00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,139
other people may or may not wear their

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,289
hats I'm trying to pressure them into

00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:25,539
that so please ask them where their hats

00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:26,889
are and like I said we have a couple of

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,149
their sessions we're doing or the one

00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:31,450
tomorrow is gonna be really interesting

00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:35,019
on menu management it's a large scope

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:38,259
content management problem that Drupal

00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,639
is solving for us as well as on Thursday

00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:42,309
morning we're doing something about

00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:44,139
how're you do DevOps and support when we

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,700
have vessels all over the world in

00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:48,340
different time zones who may or may not

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,259
be online then you know mayor Knight may

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,799
not be able to get through us and how we

00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:56,580
kind of handle that and in this kind of

00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,580
environment but

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,640
oh yeah if anybody's interested so we

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,260
showed all the the angular stuff but if

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,880
anybody we can show some of what the

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,190
Drupal side of the house really looks

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,860
like cuz like I said all this content is

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,510
driven through there or just any

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:17,450
questions anybody may have I know we

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:19,100
rushed you oh yeah show of hands how

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,630
many people are doing multilingual right

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:30,050
now in their sites okay how do you find

00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:31,820
it how's it yeah and how many people is

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,170
print still really relevant for their

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,809
businesses where they still need to work

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,809
with print okay just a few okay

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,970
with

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,120
it's it's not digital prints so there

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,800
there there I mean it's bad Pressman yes

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,190
I mean this printing press it's inked

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,540
it's to to color basics with we printed

00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,980
this in our office yeah that was printed

00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,330
in our office you can kind of see the

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,200
quality of it we can put some of these

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:07,330
out here see yeah we looked at like

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,470
digital presses a while ago because that

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,370
would have made some of this stuff like

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,080
much easier but between the costs that

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,210
was one part of it but also these things

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,430
are reliable that we have on board

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,620
they're workhorses so they can just be

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,780
chatting away constantly all day you

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:26,380
know every single day and not require a

00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,510
whole lot of you know maintenance I mean

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,550
it's a logistics problem for a ship to

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,430
get maintenance to come out to fix a

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:36,750
printing problem as well you know this

00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:39,400
is down on deck for under the waterline

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,400
it's hard to get too hard to service

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:47,380
hard to replace so but these things have

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,790
been serving us for ages reliably so you

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,320
know one of these things where the

00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,440
digital press would have been awesome we

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,090
looked into it but the benefits did not

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,090
outweigh the that cons to it

00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,630
just show hands does anybody want to see

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:06,330
the Drupal side any interest in that

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,330
yeah okay I'll show you that as well

00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,539
like

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,989
so we

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,180
yeah yeah so there they do offer it so

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:32,410
any guests in at any time can say I like

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:34,900
this but primarily it's based on people

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,810
who prior to joining the ship will say

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,330
you know this is what I would like yeah

00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,130
yeah and they'll they you know in the

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,100
past always tried to accommodate as best

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:48,100
they could but as what we've seen over

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,110
the past you know since you know four

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,250
three four years something like that is

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:56,410
that the English speakers were always

00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,240
the majority of the passengers but the

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,010
the percentage is slowly decrease

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,340
particularly in areas like Alaska and

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:05,050
these destination kind of areas where we

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,750
traditionally very North American driven

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,090
but that's changing quite quite

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,430
drastically to happen in Europe to

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:15,430
Europe used to be a lot of primarily

00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,900
North Americans taking vacations than

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,180
Europe and going on the cruise but if

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,460
that's population on board is changing

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,020
quite a bit as well and we do have Asian

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,580
charters where about 80% of the

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,080
passengers are speaking Chinese they

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,880
aren't even speaking English majority

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,990
and they're all getting Chinese patters

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,990
for the most part on those ships

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,669
yes sir yeah

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,280
we actually did that mid-project we

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,720
actually they redesigned marketing

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,150
redesigned the entire newsletter on us

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,040
and it start over new fonts new layouts

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,500
and kind of customized all those pieces

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:56,420
to come up with canvas 2.0 which is what

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:58,040
this is like it's giving them enough

00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:07,160
flexibility to do what they need on

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:09,020
board without total freedom yeah right

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,880
but it has been traditionally with our

00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,570
InDesign process you know there are

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,070
rules we should only be doing six ads

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,420
per day you know and that's those are

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,420
marketing driven and there has to be a

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:24,050
mix of revenue versus non revenue ads

00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:27,200
and that stuff and yeah yeah and so now

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,310
now that can be you know now we can make

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,510
sure that we're following those

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,510
guidelines on board though

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,470
yeah great yeah

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,470
yep

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,320
it's

00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,900
yeah it's mostly bulk you know praying

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,299
pretty done but what we're hoping to do

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,880
with this project in total is that that

00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:07,549
we don't have to over print you know cuz

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,110
that generally happens you you know you

00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:13,590
think you know this or or you you're

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:16,110
short by 20 you know so yeah so that's

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,059
the long-term vision is that we can make

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,070
this much more you know efficient

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,230
operationally they can be done just in

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,059
time rather than having to be done you

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,980
know two three crews advance so if

00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,260
there's particularly with restaurants

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,120
and there's menu changes that have to

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,260
happen because we can't source some

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,700
ingredients you know that we can do them

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,110
you know we have the set that can be

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,029
used no matter what and then the

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:41,940
on-demand ones can be done as required

00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:44,130
yeah I'll show you the Drupal part real

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,590
quick we'll create another and we've got

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,140
two ads in here so we put links directly

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:52,580
in canvas to go right to Drupal I'm

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,580
gonna sign in to our site

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:07,830
so you can go in this is our list of ads

00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:10,370
I'm gonna put a new one in actually do

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,370
it by codes

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,210
let me pick a different one

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,900
I can do it in

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,900
here

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,789
we'll see how it works we were having

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,709
some issues with our environment this be

00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:45,669
pianning right taraj live demos it's

00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:49,329
always something there you go so you

00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:50,709
actually can see how we create ads and a

00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:53,349
lot of different things in princess Etsy

00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:55,149
we use libraries content libraries with

00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:57,129
replacement patterns and the reason for

00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:58,359
this is primarily multilingual so we

00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,799
want to translate majority of the

00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,199
content but then we need placeholders

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,579
kind of variables to drop in so for

00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:05,109
example a live painting demonstration

00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,489
the artist names we can drop in but

00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:10,029
translate all the rest of the content

00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:12,579
around it and one one note there is what

00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:15,099
these also allow us to do when they come

00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:18,309
in for translation into the TMS and

00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:21,669
lingotek our translators are able to

00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:23,349
move those those replacement fields

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:25,119
around because the positioning will not

00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:29,529
always be the same depending upon the

00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,879
language being spoken rate changes so

00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:32,589
you really just select the date that we

00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:34,539
want this ad to run and the voyage

00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:39,659
filled in those replacement patterns

00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:39,659
I'll hit save and that was created

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,720
we bring this back to you both 15

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:57,270
now you see it well there's two no but I

00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,270
created fine arts finance just came in

00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,539
there you see James Smith John Smith

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,539
pulled that one

00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,720
and then we can translate it and that's

00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,720
the same for each of the different areas

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,720
yeah

00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,100
yep yeah

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:29,710
so we there's one case we do machine

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:32,290
translation majority of it is human

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,300
translation because of more we've had

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,130
some mistakes in the past work you know

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,520
the translation wasn't quite right and

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,690
it was the wrong meaning you know so

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,180
there's a lot of oversight to make sure

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,950
myth you know fits in the brand voice

00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,870
that's more what it is more than

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,380
anything but we do use machine

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:56,040
translation we have a onboard evaluation

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:59,260
that guests can fill out that includes a

00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,300
text field so the ship will actually see

00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,010
these results of like how they're shore

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,570
excursions were or what they thought

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,640
about this than that about the ship

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,410
they'll see that live it starts being

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,250
collected about 36 hours before the end

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:14,380
of a voyage anybody can fill in whatever

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,420
they want in those comment fields

00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,580
whatever language they want that

00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,350
actually then automatically comes back

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,640
shore side goes out some lingotek it's

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,810
machine translated and then goes back

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,810
out to the ship

00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:27,780
so at least they can see sentiment you

00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:30,040
know it may not be a hundred percent

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,400
correct translation but they can at

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,570
least understand oh this guests

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,760
encountered some issue on the shore

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:38,650
excursion what can I do to make sure

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,380
that they leave the ship feeling

00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:44,140
positive about us we have the ability

00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,850
for them to then say okay I I understand

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,460
mostly what this is but I do need that

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,770
extra step of a person doing a real

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,730
translation of this because primarily

00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:57,370
these this is available on the ships in

00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,830
Asia so sometimes you know the machine

00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:02,950
translation gets a little goofy with

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,120
languages so but for the most part it

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:09,030
seems to be giving them a lot of

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,030
valuable on-demand immediate feedback

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,580
go around TripIt the satellite

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,200
connections good yeah we haven't we

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,740
haven't though experiment that much with

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,840
like the new you know Google neural you

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,820
know translation that they're doing so I

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,440
don't know what the quality of the of

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,300
that stuff looks like it what we looked

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,660
like you know two and a half years ago

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,490
or so but primarily since it's gonna go

00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,970
out to the guest we've kind of it's been

00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,410
very we want to be very we have to be a

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,420
hundred percent sir and it's gonna work

00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,550
you know for the machine translated

00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,440
before we would switch to it but one of

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,540
the neat things about lingotek is that

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,270
you can have multiple stages of

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,740
translation so I mean Hillary works with

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,780
lingotek quite a bit yes actually

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,040
there's actually you can set up any kind

00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,750
of custom workflow you want within

00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,180
lingotek so we have it assigned to a

00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,100
translator and then we have employees a

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,330
princess that will review the tone so we

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,220
have somebody at princess that speaks

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,190
Chinese she'll review the tone to make

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,630
sure it matches what princess cruises

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,190
expectations are so we kind of it'll

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,600
roll through that process right she'll

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,240
get a notification and the workflow that

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,800
it's ready for review and then once she

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,930
approves it now it's approved and

00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,580
actually goes to the fleet so yeah I can

00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,230
pull from you can have machine

00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,030
translation as the first step you can

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,770
have you know multiple different flavors

00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,480
of how you want the translation workload

00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,770
to look like there's a store in our

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,180
translation memory they can be

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,890
repurposed and it's kind of that same

00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:32,070
tone is stored in our in our translation

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:34,860
memory free plug for lingotek but you

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:37,800
should check them out yeah it's been a

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,730
really good relationship for us so I

00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,730
highly recommend them

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,850
any other questions or want to see

00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,050
anything else yeah feel free to come up

00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,400
and take a look at the patters we have

00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,710
an English version and a Chinese version

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,340
that we printed off in our office you

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:58,220
take a look at how it comes out alright

00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:01,339
well thank you very much

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,339
[Applause]

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,850
just
