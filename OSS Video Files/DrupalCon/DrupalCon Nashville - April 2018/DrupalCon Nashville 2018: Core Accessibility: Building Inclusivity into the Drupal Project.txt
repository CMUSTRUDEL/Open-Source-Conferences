Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Core Accessibility: Building Inclusivity into the Drupal Project
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Drupal has come a long way in terms of accessibility over the years. In Drupal core specifically, we have been making good strides incorporating accessibility best practices into the UX and markup, but there is a lot we can still do!

This core conversation panel will discuss the current state of accessibility in the Drupal 8 project and the out-of-the-box Umami theme project, as well as ways to continue to build accessibility into future versions and themes in Drupal.

Overview:

What is accessibility and why does Drupal need it? (Quick overview)
What are some recent Drupal core accessibility improvements?
How do we think we are doing overall and what are we working on now in Drupal core?
What is the Umami project and how does it address accessibility?
What are some of the challenges we face in integrating accessibility into Drupal?
How can the community help increase accessibility in Drupal?
These questions will be jumping points into deeper conversations based on the audience, so bring your concerns, opinions, thoughts, and suggestions!

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,359
you're in core accessibility building

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,250
inclusivity into the Drupal project

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,450
welcome to our panel where today we're

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,370
going to cover some basics of

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,630
accessibility just so we're all on the

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,520
same page what it is why we need it some

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,710
great just general accessibility

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,720
features found in Drupal 8 core already

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,269
some initiatives that we're working on

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,830
and how you the audience member can get

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,840
involved here are the speakers myself

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,730
I'm from hook 42 my name is Carrie

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,500
Fisher we have mike gifford down there

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,390
from open concept

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,110
Halina mccabe from Walla bot and

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,059
Katherine McNally from phase 2 and if

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,360
you need to contact us that's our

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,539
drupal.org information and then our

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,710
Twitter information alright

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,710
so Helena's up first

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:07,520
hi so I'm gonna kick us off here with

00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,740
what accessibility is and why Drupal

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,990
needs it so at the heart of it web

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,280
accessibility is pretty simple it's

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,140
about building websites with the

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,970
necessary accommodations so that people

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,190
with disabilities can use them easily as

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,750
I explained to a client once web

00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,450
accessibility is like the wheelchair

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,770
ramp at a store but for websites it's

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,270
not a thrill yeah it's not a frill it's

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,940
a quality issue and it's especially

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,500
important to our Drupal community as we

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,810
go through this high-level overview on

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,190
the accessibility basics so bear with me

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,440
if it's something you already knew but

00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,020
we're just kind of I'm gonna layer on

00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,390
the first you know fYI and then they'll

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,710
go into the deeper stuff and I'm gonna

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,150
explain why that is so there are a few

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,280
different types of people who benefit

00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,350
mainly from web accessibility and that

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,550
is the visually impaired those are

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,560
people who might have trouble

00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,360
distinguishing between colors viewing

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,640
content without enough contrast or they

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,500
might not be able to see it all we also

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,750
have deaf and hard-of-hearing users and

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,160
they may have trouble understanding

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,590
content that is poorly captioned or not

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,570
captioned at all they benefit from a

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,420
chat option instead of having to call in

00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,310
so that's always a good thing to do we

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,930
also have users who are motor impaired

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,820
those are people who have fine or gross

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,890
motor problems that could be anything

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,540
from a tremor from Parkinson's to being

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,310
paralyzed from the neck down anything

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,800
that makes it difficult to use a mouse

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,960
I will also have people with vestibular

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,990
issues and seizures and these issues are

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,040
extremely important and often overlooked

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,840
they're one of the most directly is that

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,120
a poorly built website can physically

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,790
harm our users so it's really important

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,100
to be mindful of these I know parallax

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,480
was all the rage a few years ago a lot

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,850
of companies still really like it

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,260
designers are really fond of it but

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,760
people with vestibular issues can get

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,640
motion sickness from those types of

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,920
event effects so it's really really good

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,350
to be sparing with them um if you use

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,709
them at all and web sites with fast

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,150
bright flashing effects those

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,670
contributors in some people and seizures

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,709
can be very dangerous so no matter how

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,750
important or exciting that blog post is

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,280
please don't use flashing effects to

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,760
pull someone's attention toward it you

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,560
could really injure them

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,510
and finally we have people with

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,489
cognitive disabilities we have a large

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,769
aging population that's online people

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,180
with Alzheimer's and more people with

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,519
conditions like Down syndrome and autism

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,260
are working than ever before so

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,700
supporting these communities by helping

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,560
them be as self-sufficient as possible

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,299
is an important goal that we should be

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,989
striving toward so how people with

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,430
disabilities use the web differently um

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,829
the biggest one is keyboard and screen

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,480
reader accessibility most blind people

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,400
in people with motor disabilities don't

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,379
use a mouse they navigate the site by

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,180
keyboard and that means that nothing on

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,450
your website should require a mouse to

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,400
access or interact with this is one of

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,290
your biggest accessibility wins because

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,769
it covers so many diverse disabilities

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,819
and is heavily needed by so many people

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,799
usually when blind people are keyboard

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,359
navigating they're also using a screen

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,069
reader so that means we'll want to be

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,750
sure we're being mindful about what will

00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,459
and won't be read when someone is

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,260
navigating our websites like providing

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,000
descriptive text about the destination

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,730
of links instead of just an image or the

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,470
words click here using appropriate

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,239
alternative text on images to describe

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,430
them and it's important not to co-opt

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,010
those accommodation tools for black hat

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,660
SEO keyword stuffing please don't just

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,620
jam a lot of random key words into that

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,449
that's really harmful for people um

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,070
captions and transcripts deaf people

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,900
need captions to know what's going on in

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,370
videos with speech especially when the

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,740
speech is a narration of imagery

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,479
transcripts and captions are not the

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,169
same thing and they serve different

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,419
purposes

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,180
captions happen in time with the audio

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:58,710
and they're primarily for deaf people

00:04:44,180 --> 00:05:00,960
where transcripts are of okay time

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,820
and transcripts are a full description

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,100
of both audio and visual information

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,200
provided by a video so these are

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,640
particularly useful for deafblind users

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,250
who will usually translate this

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,540
information into a Braille reader to get

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,120
the full rundown of what that video

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,430
contained we also have color and

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,830
contrast for low vision users especially

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,770
the elderly contrast can really be key I

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:26,040
know like gray text on white backgrounds

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,740
and these hair-thin fonts are so subtle

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,930
and stylish and popular but they're

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,580
really hard for people to see especially

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,170
people who are low vision so to hit

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,210
double-a compliance the standard is a

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,700
contrast ratio of four and a half to one

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,850
for normal text and 3 to 1 for large

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:44,790
text which is anything above 18 pixels

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,500
and finally we have our cognitive we

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,900
often think of accessibility in terms of

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,430
physical accommodations but cognitive

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,530
accommodations are equally important

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,950
people with dementia and Alzheimer's

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,300
benefit from websites with a predictable

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,770
constant intuitive layout so they don't

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,260
have to constantly reorient themselves

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,150
from page to page and people with

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,760
intellectual disabilities or sensory

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,560
processing issues like dyslexia may need

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,050
more time to digest content especially

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,730
if it's complex using the clearest

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,530
language possible and not forcing users

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,130
through content at a pace beyond their

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,260
control

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,930
looking at you Auto advancing homepage

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,140
slider with text is really helpful for

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,580
those communities so our need for

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,340
accessibility in the Drupal community

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,470
comes from three main sources we have

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,510
Drupal users who are the end users who

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,610
will build our web or who will use our

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,900
websites and this is the group that we

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,820
most frequently think of when we talk

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,430
about accessibility but that's really

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,170
only a part of the picture we also have

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,850
our Drupal developers our community

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,190
members who will build websites using

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,020
Drupal and I know blind developers who

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,030
love Drupal 8 because of how easy it is

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,100
for them to use on the back end people

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,950
with disabilities aren't just consumers

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,570
of content they're creating it too so an

00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,130
inclusive Drupal community needs to be

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,780
built to include everyone who wants to

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,330
use these tools not just the easiest

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,920
bodies to build for and of course our

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,840
Drupal clients which are the businesses

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,100
and agencies the Drupal developers build

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,260
websites for one of the most pervasive

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,830
excuses for skipping over accessibility

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,960
on Web projects is that it's an

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,750
edge case and this really has to stop

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,520
because it's not I've heard countless

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,900
times that there's no budget for it on

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,640
the project because there were other

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,650
features that the client wanted and so

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,170
accessibility was deprioritized as an

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,650
edge case and in every instance this has

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,660
happened

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,700
ie testing in support has stayed on the

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,980
roster so to put it into perspective

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,080
we've got somewhere between twelve point

00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,880
six a percent of all people in the u.s.

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,070
having a disability and somewhere

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,690
between 3% 8% of all people using IE so

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,310
why is it that as an industry we're

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,170
fascinated with accounting for a browser

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,720
that very few people are using but

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,900
routinely ignoring or deport or D

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,960
prioritizing accessibility at 12 percent

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,150
twelve point six percent of the 2016

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,430
population that brings us to an

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,290
estimated forty point seven million

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,420
people in the US with a disability

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,910
that's about a million more people than

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,130
the entire population of California or

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,080
since we're in Nashville around six

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:17,080
times as many people as the population

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:19,120
of Tennessee so why do Drupal clients

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,800
need accessibility what we have improved

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,660
access to customers because twelve point

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,060
six percent of the population is a lot

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:30,580
and we have legal safety because being

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:33,250
sued is bad so we have section 508 the

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,620
week act 2.0 and title 3 of the ADA a

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,360
and the main one I want to hit here is

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,350
the Americans with Disabilities Act of

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,560
1990 because in 2017 digital spaces

00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:47,050
became the legal responsibility of the

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,440
private sector we've had a lot of

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,000
landmark lawsuits in the last few years

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,770
the federal court just ruled that when

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Dixie's website being inaccessible

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,270
violated the 88 so

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,550
there's legal precedent now for the

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,050
private sector as well as public so if

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,610
you thought oh well we don't have to do

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,180
it because we're not under Section 508

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,880
which applies to public no now it now

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,070
the ADA applies to you as well so the

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,080
bottom line is the triples a big deal

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,440
we're estimated at a market share of

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,540
about 2.2 percent of all websites and

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,950
even if that number doesn't seem like a

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,310
big one when you consider how many

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,690
websites actually exist it's massive the

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,330
work we're doing here a matter

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,040
a lot and agencies may not always know

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,840
how or they may not make time for

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,150
accessibility so the better our core

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,730
product is out of the box the better

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,750
accessibility will be for everyone so

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,700
now that I've given you a high-level

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,080
overview of what accessibility is and

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,850
why we're doing it I'm going to pass it

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,500
off to Kathryn who will tell us about

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,710
what we've done recently to make things

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,710
better

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,290
so I'm Katherine from face - I'm

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,930
somebody who is deaf I really appreciate

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,060
men versus using companies try to

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,160
implement accessibility from the very

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,050
beginning so that's why I'm so amazing

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,690
to see accessibility

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,400
out of the box in triple-eight somewhat

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,490
excited to go over some of these

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,680
accessibility improvements that we have

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,170
to make Drupal even more accessible

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,120
we're getting a stronger foundation that

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:25,690
we can build upon and so some important

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,900
people winter as of late the inline form

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,550
errors if you recall previously I mean

00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,530
there was error you were just a message

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,480
at the top of the screen you had to

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,300
figure out where the errors gonna be so

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,950
these inline air forms are really useful

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,340
but how to actually show you where the

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:45,460
error is but not only is that great it's

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,130
also added on the layer of people

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,760
announced because it's gonna alert the

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,680
spirit easier that there's an error

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,600
previously I mean there was an error if

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,760
the news of a screen reader wasn't

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,740
immediately made aware back in that

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,050
latitude user frustration I'm like what

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,570
why cannot submit this form they

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,060
couldn't find the error so combined with

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,280
people announced in the form errors we

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,780
see a lot of improvement in reducing

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:17,200
user frustration infection new mommy out

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,790
of the box is a theme in duple 8 this is

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,700
not quite out yet it's still an

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,580
experimental mode but they did a great

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,950
example of an accessible theme out there

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,130
it's got some great accessibility but

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:33,370
then marks headings link structures is

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:35,320
in some enhancement or in the pipeline

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,450
but I'll go over some of these

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,820
enhancements in a few minutes

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,460
and then we finally got this point

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,830
release going right now and most people

00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,680
have a way for me to update to see some

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,120
improvement Vicki see more incremental

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,090
updates which is gonna really help us

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,620
test out new accessibility features and

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,520
something to respond a while in the

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:01,120
market as I mentioned people announced

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,220
I'm gonna show speed meter demo how many

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,580
of you have heard a scream eater before

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:10,030
oh okay great so this will be that oh my

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:13,870
gosh and again a speed experience is

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,060
completely different that me as sighted

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:19,060
people can't experience the same as

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,830
somebody who is blind or has low person

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,200
experience it pleasure so nice to if

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,500
they it's a part of the experience but

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,460
we should still be thinking about how we

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,540
can create experiences so this is

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:37,900
digitally mommy team and I intentionally

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:40,150
submitted an empty search and so you

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,090
should be hearing the Duplin ounce right

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:47,220
away see here

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,220
oh dear I think we're right before

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:09,890
so that was good yay do burnouts so what

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,780
happens might have to submit they were

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:15,140
immediately made aware of those two

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,420
error messages previously he will vote

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,370
and they have to go through skip to main

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:26,990
until they found the error so that's

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:29,450
awesome okay so people announce is still

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,930
a model and you have to enable so we're

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,640
still missing the mark into procore you

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,620
know the more options in more places

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,070
where we can apply people eight I'm

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,750
sorry to pronounce and you know how we

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,140
can make how can we help the community

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,450
be made aware of this model and

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,610
implemented into the model so that if

00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,500
there's an error that people announce

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:56,300
and come up and be beneficial for

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,020
speeders in new model owners and even

00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,950
know about it

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,360
some doesn't did that meaty to be

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,300
talking more about I something does give

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,980
you a really useful and so new Miami

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:12,470
accessibility so you've got some many

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,680
accessibility enhancements in some menu

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:18,980
arm over menu fix is coming down

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,140
um primary beaming updates it's a really

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,050
good experience heading structures of

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,140
networks are in place I'm gonna play a

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,030
video of the landmarks and so I'm gonna

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,070
go through all of the landmarks I didn't

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,660
do any additional coding they just all

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,490
new mommy in DubLi

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,150
it's a landmarks it's pretty great and

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,820
then I'm gonna stop it kind of appropri

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:44,150
I'm because to have another section of

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,450
the video so just forget me if I stop in

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,450
the middle

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,870
wait slots menu learning works menu

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,870
better navigation navigation search

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:04,550
content home main user account search

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,769
main navigation navigation you are

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,050
currently in the navigation heading

00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:12,260
level 2 main navigation list three items

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:14,360
visited link home one of three link

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,420
articles two of three you are currently

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:21,019
on a link visited link recipes 3 of 3

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,930
you press visited the recipe for so that

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,060
is not do anything from a content editor

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,740
developer perspective so this is really

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,170
encouraging your media policy to see

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,029
that this theme already had to stay at

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,250
marks in place and their marks are

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:36,019
really useful for screen readers beside

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,260
to give some context in the center place

00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:42,680
and have an announcement meaning one of

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,110
three to 350 helps them with a sense of

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,940
order and have picked them anyways so

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:59,480
those are all really promising things in

00:15:46,940 --> 00:16:01,490
your mommy and so we've got some color

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,260
contrast ratio updates that need to be

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:09,020
applied redundant links I'm seeing this

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:13,070
moonwalk I mean you have they can image

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:15,589
the title and a wheat welding HyperCard

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,980
a purse that you see a grid and a lot of

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:20,720
times it's three links together so it

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,990
becomes favorite aunt and turski reader

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:29,000
and so we need to be wrapping it as one

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:32,750
link item so so like Baker cookie would

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,770
be wine recipe link and so I'm gonna see

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,770
you back and pay that for you guys

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,899
[Music]

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,550
all right it's right here articles two

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,030
or three you are currently on a link

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,160
visited link you press visited me demo

00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,900
web content mean that search use

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,280
breadcrumb your heading level to Blake

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,640
deep Mediterranean fusion

00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,080
you know Blake Jamie visited link image

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,340
a white plate with a vegan chocolate

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,170
brownie covered in dark vegan chocolate

00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,000
you are currently on a link to click

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,340
this link press ctrl option space

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,910
difficulty medium heading level two

00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,920
visited link leaving chocolate brownies

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,750
so those are the three of the same links

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,600
and so the speed you can have to repeat

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,490
themselves so one of the updates that

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,710
really aren't what the community is

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,510
working on is making that one whole link

00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:28,130
so that she's gonna make a much more

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:30,230
intuitive experience so that's great so

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:36,500
we exciting stuff in with a theme coming

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:39,350
up in some in the error message states

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,450
happy in colors icons and text is gonna

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,090
be something that we'd be working on in

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,860
the theme and the layer builder there's

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,030
still a few issues with getting the

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,680
layer builder to be accessible and so

00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:54,140
still some good stuff coming up really

00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,420
promising was exciting to see all of

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,860
these foundational in the community

00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,990
coming together to make something even

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,060
more accessible out of the box so imma

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,940
turn over to Mike you give you talking

00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:13,190
about one of the initiatives that are

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:16,190
rockin on Thank You Katherine so first

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:19,310
of all how many people have contributed

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:23,960
at all to two issues and in Drupal

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:25,160
accessibility over the years okay that's

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,480
great

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,330
and how many people here are are

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,460
familiar with with or have to have have

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,880
tested at all with with accessibility of

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,990
Drupal excellent so it's good to see

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,800
that there's not many people who who've

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,840
looked at and evaluated this

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,000
accessibility is very much a journey and

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,770
not a destination so we're never going

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,680
to be able to get Drupal to a point

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,030
where it's perfectly accessible so it's

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,260
it's something where we're going to need

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,150
keep needing your info

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,250
and direction to find ways to make it

00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,900
better and better as we go ahead

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:04,940
especially as we keep adding new

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,410
exciting features I've gone off and used

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,580
some notation here that I think should

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,320
be common in Drupal

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,480
most people will recognize this if

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,419
you're familiar with the issue queue I'm

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,460
just using the hashtag here in brackets

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,730
which will in the drupal issue cube go

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,720
off and give you a link to the issue so

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,700
rather than putting in the whole

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,049
drupal.org issue I'm just providing the

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,549
the short form and this is something

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,929
that's that I'll just use that for a

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,460
couple slides slides go off and give

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:35,840
give people some reference to some of

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:39,710
some existing issues so one things that

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,830
that we need to do and haven't yet found

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,590
a and implementation for is is looking

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,169
at providing some sort of a test swarm

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:51,049
for for Drupal accessibility we had an

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:53,809
early one set up on quayle which is a

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,600
JavaScript library that was built for

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,250
you know kind of for Drupal you know

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,410
forth within the Drupal community and it

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,710
was a standalone initially PHP and then

00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,929
JavaScript library that that that was

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,760
was developed those was really good but

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:09,830
it's no longer being supported and and

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,470
but there's there's opportunities to go

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:15,860
off into to build a test suite for

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,140
either poly or axe core or even with

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,260
with tools like tenon which are great

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,940
tools for for doing automated sort of

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,380
site-wide tests but it's it's it's

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,960
something that that takes people who

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,150
have interest experience and background

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,700
in in developing javascript testing

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,130
environments and and given the size and

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,110
the complexity of Drupal we need to be

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,900
able to to be able to monitor whether or

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,700
not just basically our errors going up

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,679
or down are we finding this are we in a

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,480
situation where we're with every patch

00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,820
that's submitted with every bill that

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,340
goes out are we finding ourselves to be

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,650
more accessible or less accessible keep

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,840
in mind with any automated test there

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,160
you're only going to catch a fraction of

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,200
the accessibility errors that are out

00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,880
there there's some really good tools out

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,160
there but they're not going to catch

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,200
everything and so don't assume that just

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,559
because it passes the the tests that

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,350
you're

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,899
your code is accessible likewise don't

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,970
assume that if you're you know if you're

00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:13,980
if your code fails the test it doesn't

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,110
necessarily mean that that there's an

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,379
accessibility problem there either the

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,320
tests are just tests so so there's

00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,549
there's a lot of opportunity around

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,679
continuous integration and it's

00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:29,549
establishing that a stronger testing

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,840
infrastructure and the the the the issue

00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:36,210
number if you're looking forward is to

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:37,919
eight five seven eight oh eight and you

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,499
know we there's a if anyone here wants

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,999
to step up and take on opportunities to

00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,549
go off into building more automated

00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:47,330
tests into Drupal core that would help

00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:49,320
help moving ahead quite considerably

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,830
laio builder was another interesting

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,830
challenge that we ran into in drupal and

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:58,019
it's it's a lay-oh builder is is is a

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:02,340
great initiative to allow us to more

00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:04,649
dynamically go and address how pages are

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,879
designed and how content is organized on

00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:08,340
a page

00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:09,720
unfortunately it's there are no good

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,119
patterns right now that are widely

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,389
accepted for how to do drag-and-drop

00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,669
functionality so we've we've done

00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:20,940
there's an issue queue that we've worked

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:25,049
on which I know it's issue to nine to

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,309
zero zero zero six which is we need to

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:29,100
go up and identify what those best

00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:30,240
practices were and it's one of the great

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,889
things about working on Drupal

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,619
accessibility is that we can actually

00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:37,710
take a pioneering role in identifying

00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:41,340
and creating the best practice for for

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:45,090
for for for the web and it's it's a

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,740
we've did that with both the CSS

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,299
display:none alternatives which were

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,730
brought in in Drupal 7 that's a really

00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,759
great way and it's it's a we've seen

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:57,899
other other software projects adopt a

00:22:53,759 --> 00:23:00,200
centralized CSS management for for for

00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:02,399
invisible or a hidden or on focused text

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,220
but but it's it's still something that's

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:07,470
that's that not everyone knows about and

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,179
it's it's really important to have these

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,850
kinds of centralized functions because

00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,619
it allows us to to be able to be future

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,480
compatible technology changes all the

00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:17,160
time and if you centralize functionality

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,250
like drag-and-drop

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,840
then you can you can fix it when the

00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,420
browser has changed when the the

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,610
assistive technology is modified when

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,730
user functionality it is is adjusted

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,590
then you can update that that that

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,380
pattern in one place and have that

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,110
rollout across not just your site but

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:41,150
all of the the the sites that that use

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:44,430
that particular particular library so

00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:47,280
you know we wanted to go off and make

00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:49,500
sure that the the that we have a good

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,900
pattern in place and and there's some

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,520
some interesting tools that are being

00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,160
built with react right now that we might

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,780
be able to to use to leverage the the

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,360
interesting work that's being done to

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,460
try and update the the the JavaScript to

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,470
have a JavaScript driven back-end for

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:08,310
Drupal so again that that could be quite

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,770
quite useful it's it is a bit unclear

00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:13,770
right now in some ways when when the

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:17,430
Drupal accessibility team identifies a

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:19,560
problem with with the the issues who's

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,540
responsible for fixing that issue and

00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,560
how you know the accessibility team is

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,200
really quite small

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,670
whether we're active on the the slack

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,610
chat you'll be able to see a link to the

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,880
the slack chat it's just the Drupal

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:35,880
there's an accessibility channel in the

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,830
the Drupal slack chat but there's a few

00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,140
us who are engaged there and and Angie

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,610
McPherson is as has been as you know a

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,650
real bonus having him on board because

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,670
he's he's taking on a whole other range

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:50,100
of initiatives looking at WK 2.1 and

00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:53,040
looking at at trying to to do more work

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,050
on on the the user testing and and and

00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,870
having having more people look at ways

00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:59,430
that we could make group of letters is

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,560
is really important and Andrews taking a

00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,480
wonderful leadership role in that we

00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,010
really wanted to bring them over to to

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,460
the UK or starting from the UK but

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,810
couldn't couldn't justify that so so

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,000
with the the the drag-and-drop

00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,160
functionality we have a couple patterns

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,830
we need examples of we need some help

00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,660
testing and choosing a pattern and

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,990
hopefully being able to to roll that out

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,360
so that we have a a common pattern for

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,190
the layout builder that we can we can

00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,610
use across the board and and make sure

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,179
that that we're able to to proceed with

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,769
this

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,429
and this is actually this is a problem

00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,929
that we did kind of address in Drupal 7

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,210
many of you may have looked at the

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:41,639
widget the show hi widget above tables

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,610
if you're doing a table drag I mean

00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:46,860
that's essentially a kind of

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,690
drag-and-drop functionality except that

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,429
that our solution in that case was to

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,460
build a widget that disabled the

00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:55,679
JavaScript and that kind of that has

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,330
some problems and some advantages but

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,850
but if that's how we tried to go off and

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,889
address that we need a solution right

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,080
now that works for for two-dimensional

00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:06,119
world so you can go off remove items

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,889
both left and right and up and down and

00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,409
know where that item is after you've

00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:12,840
moved it whether you're using a keyboard

00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:17,009
or whether you're using a tool like

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:19,080
voice over or NVDA and and that's that's

00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,639
definitely a challenge but we also need

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,549
to be thinking ahead because at some

00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:25,499
point we may be having VR or AR

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,119
integration with our websites and we

00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:28,499
might need to be able to not only go off

00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,659
and worry about moving it left and right

00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:31,919
but also forward and back and what is

00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,450
the language and the patterns that we

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:39,090
use to communicate about moving things

00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:41,519
around in those different dimensions so

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,960
I mentioned a little bit about WK 2.1

00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,419
this is a standard which has not been

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,309
released yet but like all other

00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:50,759
standards on the web they change and

00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:52,889
evolve over time and WK 2.1 is an effort

00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,340
to try and and modernize and bring up to

00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:59,340
date the the the guidelines that were

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,960
set up WK 2.0 although it's new to many

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,490
people in the united states that's

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,110
actually a legislature that's a

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,759
guideline that was was put forward in

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:10,080
2008 and it's now 2018 so it's it's more

00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,700
than time for us to go up and update

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,429
that standard and to look at who we've

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,080
missed and who we need to go off and

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,970
bring into the community and one of the

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,450
big areas we've we've looked that's

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:24,389
being addressed for for WK 2.1 is is

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,129
cognitive disabilities and and things

00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:27,419
like you know we haven't done enough to

00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:29,820
try and address issues like plain

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,350
language how do we make sure that that

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,090
we're communicating to people in a way

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,090
that they can understand particularly in

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,720
a very busy hectic world that we are all

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:41,590
living in areas another one we've

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,690
implemented some area in

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,550
in Drupal well we've lamented very

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,310
little in Drupal 7 we implemented quite

00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:51,430
a lot interpolate but these standards

00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:52,540
are evolving over time as well and we

00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,800
need to go off and make sure that we've

00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,930
implemented the correct way and that

00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:01,270
we're not that we're appropriately

00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:03,280
labeling the the are our templates as

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,410
well as the functional elements of our

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,970
our site and are able to keep up with

00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:11,410
with the best practices of the web

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,780
there's some amazing opportunities to

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:16,090
try and insert accessibility into into

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,070
all kinds of things you know many of us

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,980
are still at the the stage of looking to

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:23,860
have about how to go out from migrated

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,860
information over into into from a Drupal

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,360
6 or Drupal 7 website into Drupal 8

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,880
wouldn't it be great in the the process

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,950
of migrating your site over that that

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,010
you were able to clean up the old you

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:39,040
know HTML 4 4 code be able to bring that

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,570
up to a modern standard for a for a

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,130
modern responsive web site that you were

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,830
able to strip out all the font tags

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,020
you're able to verify which which of the

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,170
pages you're migrating over have are

00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,640
missing alt text and and might have

00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,710
broken links and and other things that

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,570
are problem for for that for the user

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,980
with the migrated content she wouldn't

00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,510
be good if we could try and do that as

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,520
opposed to leaving this as this nasty

00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,260
problem well we could look at this we

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,240
could build this into to the migrate

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,400
module and find ways that we're we're

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,700
able to test User Content as it's being

00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,190
brought in and make sure that that that

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,020
is especially at these big these big

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,510
pain points for organizations were able

00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,990
to help them adopt best practices going

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:23,200
forward the medium module is another one

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:28,290
where where where things were it wasn't

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:32,710
a concern in in Drupal 8.0 to to have a

00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:35,680
to look at at the the the a lot of the

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,420
the structure of it actually is just to

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,690
mention we've tried to go off and look

00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:43,450
at the incorporate a tag concepts into

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:46,210
Drupal Drupal 8 a tag is the authoring

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,880
tool accessibility guidelines which for

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,920
especially for any institution like a

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,840
university or a government agency a tag

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,710
it seems like it's a really wonderful

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,190
way to go off and save a hell of a lot

00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,960
money and resources if you can improve

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,909
the offering interface so that it's

00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,940
easier for authors to produce more

00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:06,740
accessible content by defaults then you

00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,990
will save money it's just it's a

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,380
no-brainer but nobody wants to invest in

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:16,640
that and and find ways to to make sure

00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,840
that that content is is yeah that

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,700
they're helping their authors out as

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,710
much as they can and using the tools and

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,120
the technology to be able to help their

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,630
authors produce the best content

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,049
possible but now that we've got the the

00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,610
medium module into actually as of a

00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,669
point for it well we need to be thinking

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,590
about how to go off and think about ways

00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:39,919
to make sure make sure that they that

00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:42,140
were were we're addressing new images

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:47,179
and videos more effectively in the

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,429
authoring process and with Yamani a game

00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:52,760
is this there's a lot more that can be

00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:54,830
done where you know especially as

00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,020
contents being added to the site I find

00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,049
that that the is it's great to have this

00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,720
demo site out there and and is amazing

00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:04,399
that that people like Kerry have gone

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,620
gone so far to go off and make the alt

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,140
tag tags not only there but actually

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,760
tasty like you know if you look at the

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,559
the alt tags you know if you're reading

00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,539
the alt tags you should feel as hungry

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,070
looking at reading the alt text as you

00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,799
are looking at the images and it was

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,289
wonderful to go often to see the the alt

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,570
text I started to talk about the the

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:26,600
initial story of you mommy and how that

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,130
was was you know how the making of the

00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,899
that the photo is for you mommy is as

00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,820
part of the the keynote this morning and

00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:34,669
and again if we can try and take some of

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,320
that that passion that went into - to

00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:38,179
making these images and finding ways to

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,799
actually make it also accessible so that

00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,149
everyone wants to go off and have a you

00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:45,110
know a cookie or a brownie or that would

00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,250
delicious soup so yeah so there's

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,590
there's a number of strategic

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,909
initiatives that are being set forth by

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:55,230
the the Drupal Drupal core team the

00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:56,850
theme component library

00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,970
we've got the JavaScript modders

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:03,299
modernization movement there's issues

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:05,210
around the experimental admin UI the

00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:08,460
outside-in

00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,110
process and each of these like there are

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,880
accessibility elements and all of them

00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,580
and they need to be tested and evaluated

00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,960
and the accessibility team is really

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,309
quite small and we might have the

00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,080
ability to go off and to jump up and

00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,460
take be involved in some of these things

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,909
but we need really to have more people

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,049
looking at these and finding ways to

00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:28,830
evaluate them with tools like the wave

00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:30,539
toolbar with the with tenon with color

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,340
contrast tools like there's a lot of the

00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:33,899
stuff can be tested quite easily with

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,789
automated tools and you don't need to be

00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:38,399
an accessibility expert in order to do

00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:39,269
them if you see a red flag then then if

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,769
you see something say something

00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:41,970
something like that you know

00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,799
like we can we can have people

00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,539
participate in the issue queue we can

00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,190
find people to participate with with

00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,200
creating patches and some of these

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,720
things are very easy to evaluate

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,250
there's harder things as well that do

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,110
you need some it is some experience but

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,090
but so much can be done by just you know

00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,370
can you tab through the interface can't

00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,990
do that when you're building a test can

00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:05,519
you can you evaluate whether or not it

00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:07,919
meets if the wave wave toolbar or or the

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,690
axe cord do they produce any errors that

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,460
you're identifying if we can have that

00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,440
testing being done by other people in

00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,299
the community it helps a whole lot and

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,510
we can always use more people in the the

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:20,429
Drupal accessibility team as well so

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,380
jump up and and can you know join the

00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:30,000
slack group and find ways to to get

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:32,820
involved and now this is a part as Mike

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,500
said that like I I've been working with

00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,059
accessibility for a few years now and

00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,370
I've written things and I've done

00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,799
testing and had clients and built this

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,720
like cool like accessibility component

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,519
library and I got to do a lot of fun

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,340
things but I and I've been in the Drupal

00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,460
community since 2005 but I had never

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,200
contributed to the codebase until this

00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,470
year and a couple months ago actually

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,470
with the help of my company hooked 42

00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,970
and Amy June that works there and it

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,720
just happened to be you mommy which

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,090
everyone's talking about and

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,220
very exciting and I got to do some

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,080
things that you know even though with

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,410
all the the stuff that I've done with

00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,650
accessibility I literally wrote text to

00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:17,050
describe an image and so it's not that

00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,970
you have to be this person you can be

00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,980
the person that you know wants to

00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,990
describe what a brownie looks like on a

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,660
plate you know and you can still be a

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,640
core contributor to Drupal and you know

00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,260
that's kind of sad that that's like my

00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:33,070
core credits but I did a few other

00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:36,070
things but yeah so don't don't think of

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,930
this is like a huge accessibility issue

00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,070
but there are some challenges and we're

00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,840
going to kind of talk about some of the

00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:46,510
things that people do are worried about

00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,490
so again if you think okay I'm a

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,990
beginner into accessibility and how can

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,600
I contribute you know I'm just

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,700
interested in the topic but that's great

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,710
because that's where we all started from

00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,020
we all started with just an interest and

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:02,200
a drive and so it could be that you just

00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:05,170
check the color contrast and verify that

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,610
you know that code you know it's correct

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,320
you know it's just like all these little

00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,090
tiny things that add up

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,220
but speaking of automated testing

00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,110
they're really only catching right now

00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,780
about twenty to forty percent on a good

00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:19,360
day and all the different tools that are

00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,800
out there for automated testing some are

00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,680
better at some things and some things

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,270
are better at others and I'm actually

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,690
excited about the day when we're gonna

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,220
catch you know 80 maybe 90 I'll never

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,140
say a hundred there I feel like we'll

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,140
never get to 100 but maybe maybe I'll

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,240
prove me around please but so that's a

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,740
challenge because if you you know if

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,630
you're only running automated testing

00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,990
you're only going to catch let's say 40

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,070
percent so then you can go on to manual

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,010
accessibility testing which includes

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,990
things like using keyboard navigation to

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,900
tab through a page or using assistive

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,960
technology devices to see where the

00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,360
errors are but it can take a long time

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,250
and can be difficult and it is also one

00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,870
of those things that you kind of have to

00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:04,480
practice a little bit before you can

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:06,970
feel like really confident and what the

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,700
problem is and how to address it and

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,710
then on top of all of that we have this

00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,170
accessibility as a moving target so

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,930
we're talking about the week hag 2.0 is

00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,490
that we're on right now

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,010
two point ones they're coming out in

00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,930
June you got all the other eight tags

00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,630
and you cut the a da and you've got all

00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,119
these laws and regulations and then you

00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,980
have browsers right browsers are not

00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,640
stagnant they keep evolving and changing

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,980
and introducing little fun bugs and you

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,450
know things that we've to squish

00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,180
assistive technologies themselves also

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,579
change inversions matter and one

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:43,309
assistive technology on you know I don't

00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:45,950
know Chrome version whatever is going to

00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:48,589
be different possibly on Safari version

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,900
whatever so it's not even like there's

00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:54,079
consistent bugs that you're seeing also

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:57,200
and then users we're all unique people

00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,980
and we all have our unique abilities and

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,650
limitations and so these are a lot of

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,420
challenges but I'm gonna make you feel

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,119
maybe a little bit happier and give you

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,490
some of the why you should help so we

00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,109
talked about some of the things that

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,780
we're doing in triple-eight some of the

00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:16,819
things that we want to do in the future

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,290
but why should you help right if you're

00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,150
an organization there's a lot of

00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,040
different reasons like saving time and

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:25,069
money it's the law that's sort of great

00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,720
stuff as an agency in themselves as the

00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:28,839
leader you want to attract these

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,339
employees you want to attract clients

00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,829
think of it as you know if we're talking

00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:35,740
about 1 billion people in the world who

00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:39,500
have identified as having a disability

00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:42,020
that's a large percentage of potential

00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,490
customers that you could have so the if

00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,980
you know if you kind of switch it around

00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,410
a little bit helps you know bring in the

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,569
money and the the time in the effort and

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,359
then the community if we can develop

00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:55,700
skills and we have a great team we can

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,290
get together and as individual as you

00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,559
can grow as well so there's a lot of

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:02,750
really great reasons why you should help

00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:04,520
so we'll get to the how and we'll go

00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,500
through a little faster so we can have

00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,530
time for questions but how can you help

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,299
so again going to events like this going

00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,250
to sessions like this that's great

00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:18,200
checking the triple dot org issue queue

00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,299
if you're an agency or an organization

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,420
give your volunteers or your employees

00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:26,900
some time to do this maybe a little bit

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,089
of extra research time or allowing them

00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,160
to go to a conference or a local meetup

00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:33,490
there's a lot of great things the

00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,420
community also it's one of those

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,270
community you have to be a good

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,859
community source as a person wanting to

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,260
learn but then you also have to have the

00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,569
people who will step up and teach and I

00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,930
might not be an expert at you know the

00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:50,000
latest I don't know back in whatever but

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,730
then I know that this person knows this

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,960
so we can put our skills together

00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,400
accessibility in front end and then

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,020
they're back in skills and we can talk

00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,140
about like how can we make a solution

00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:04,609
that's holistic so I think it's it takes

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,710
all of us so a couple of ways we've all

00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:10,069
talked today about code we talked a lot

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,980
about code so like mommy updates

00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:14,599
JavaScript workspace experimental

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,220
modules there's a lot of things you can

00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,680
easily find you issue cues with the

00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,420
accessibility tag but beyond that

00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,799
there's so much more that people can do

00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,240
too and I feel like that part gets

00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:25,549
really lost especially at tech

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,250
conferences but documentation and

00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:30,650
documentation and documentation you may

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,660
not know everything but you can start to

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,869
write about it or and you get into it

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,829
and you get to deep you know thinking

00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,809
Mike Gifford myself

00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:41,660
Andrew McPherson we all have access to

00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:43,880
the Drupal or documentation module or

00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,740
pages so if you get in there and you've

00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,260
seen this and you say oh you know Mike

00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,180
we're missing this section art Kerry I

00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,670
think you need to change this or edit

00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,369
this page you can either send that to us

00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,049
directly or you can you know edit the

00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:59,030
node and then we can just submit it and

00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:01,579
then we press ok and basically plug

00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,890
publish your changes but if we're not

00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:07,369
doing it we also want you guys to choose

00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:10,309
so the team effort so these other ones

00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:14,240
too connections and meeting up we have

00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:16,190
this a group of drupal group a Drupal

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,440
group and we have a monthly

00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,880
accessibility meet up so it's virtual

00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,819
you don't you can do it in your pajamas

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,549
and you know whatever whatever time it

00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:28,040
is you're in your time zone we have the

00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:29,869
hashtag Ally talks and every month what

00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,700
we get is we get an expert from the

00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:34,069
accessibility community to come in and

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,839
talk about a various topic so we've had

00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:38,220
things about documentation we've had

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,200
people come in and talk about JavaScript

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,569
we've had people who come in like even

00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,700
Hellena was on a panel where you talked

00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:47,430
about like how we use Drupal and how we

00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,799
use accessibility in our daily lives at

00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,480
work and and what it means to us and so

00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:52,799
there's a lot of like different topics

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,319
and a lot of things to learn so you may

00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:57,299
not like you know this month's challenge

00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,980
or this month's topic but then the next

00:40:57,299 --> 00:41:01,920
month it switches and all of that is

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,730
recorded - on the YouTube channel and

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,200
connections

00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:09,410
so besides Drupal there's this crazy big

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,180
world out there accessibility world and

00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:14,819
internationally it is huge like Canada

00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,230
and Europe especially are like I hate to

00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:18,630
say that but they're lightyears ahead of

00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,280
us right and they've been doing it a

00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,950
little bit longer they may have slightly

00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,359
different laws or rules but I mean if

00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,390
we're talking about week hag - I know

00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,740
that's international standards so

00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:30,569
there's a lot you can learn from people

00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,520
who've already done it as well you know

00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:34,289
if you do want to have people to look up

00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,940
to that you've been doing it for twenty

00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:39,480
thirty years I'm not quite there yet

00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,950
maybe mike is there yet but the rest of

00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,890
us have a few more years to catch up -

00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,960
to Europe but besides that there's the

00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,789
w3 slack channel so if you want to get

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,710
outside the Drupal island that's a great

00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:51,960
place I love it there's so many really

00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:55,650
wonderful people there Twitter company

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,869
blogs tasks writing projects just it's

00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:01,559
all over there and if you need help look

00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:03,809
resources so I won't read all of these

00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,369
because we don't have time but if we'll

00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:08,190
keep these let this slide deck will be

00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:09,960
on this presentation and so you can come

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,339
back and reference it but some of the

00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,930
things that we talked about today if you

00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:16,020
want to get in a little bit deeper about

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,400
those accessibility statements these are

00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,630
all the Drupal ones this is the

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,829
documentation I was talking about

00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:24,569
earlier and then some of the the groups

00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:26,760
so the Drupal slack to be through see

00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:29,160
and then you have these other meetup

00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,450
groups I threw up my style guide in case

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,000
your friend and developer and you care

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,890
about that but also this accessibility

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,099
people and company lists this is just on

00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,480
github and it's got a great list of

00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,770
people and companies that are

00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,190
contributing to the accessibility

00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:48,539
worldwide the cause and so they are a

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:50,369
wealth of information so so that's about

00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:51,269
it oh I'm gonna read this real quick

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:53,819
this is one of

00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:58,380
favorite quotes collectively because I

00:42:53,819 --> 00:43:01,619
chose it but the power of the web is in

00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,719
its universality access by everyone

00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,209
regardless regardless of disability is

00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,969
an essential aspect and this is Tim

00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:11,640
berners-lee which is a w3c director and

00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:13,979
inventor of the World Wide Web

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,559
so it's it's important and even from the

00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:18,419
very very beginning they knew that that

00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,659
was something that was very important

00:43:18,419 --> 00:43:22,919
and equalizing for all of us so thank

00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:25,049
you guys that's our formal presentation

00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:28,559
now if you have any more if you have any

00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:31,519
questions this would be a time oh and go

00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,519
to the mic if you can

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:56,230
I'm familiar with 18f 18f yeah they've

00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,250
got some good accessibility resources

00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:02,440
from the government and if you come up I

00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,850
can give you that you are out for it and

00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,650
they have some neat federal government

00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:12,130
accessibility practices how to were

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:14,860
specifically section 508 yeah there's

00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,600
mass gov I don't know people mentioned

00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,680
that one and there's the UK one

00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,080
do you miss that song you're gonna

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,220
mention the government digital services

00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,960
in the UK it's got some wonderful

00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,760
resources and it's a great place to look

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,500
at and they're also leading the open

00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,630
government initiative in a lot of ways

00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,910
so if you're looking for for open and

00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:33,930
accessible like the UK is a great

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,930
example internationally

00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:10,810
yes uh anything that there goes my phone

00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,880
yeah people will get motion sickness I

00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,619
mean people come in all stripes so you

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,590
know what impacts one person may not

00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:20,560
impact another but videos that have a

00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,880
lot of motion when the person is not

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,920
moving anything that can make you feel

00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,869
like you're moving like a video out the

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,670
window of a car or you know out of the

00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:30,270
window of an elevator things like that

00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,270
can cause

00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,690
[Music]

00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:45,560
so two responses to that one

00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:48,800
one is the there's the there's the

00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,210
ckeditor accessibility plug-in which I'm

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,330
not sure the other one you were

00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:54,740
referring to

00:46:52,330 --> 00:47:01,270
yeah there's an older module for Drupal

00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:01,270
7 yeah yeah yeah

00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:08,180
the the quail is is no longer supported

00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:11,530
nobody's touching quail so so that's a

00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:13,820
real problem for both the the the

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:15,590
accessibility module that Kevin had set

00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,780
up initially that was using quail to go

00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:20,240
off and to do those tests but it's also

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,860
a problem for the ckeditor accessibility

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,190
plugging that some people are are

00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:27,260
building in because because it because

00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,660
they're running JavaScript on their site

00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:31,580
you know an unsupported JavaScript

00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,010
library in their site and what are the

00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,380
security implications of just leaving

00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:38,480
another unsupported JavaScript library

00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,820
in your site it may be nothing but I

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,900
don't recommend it for any of my clients

00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,900
and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:47,690
else so you know in terms of upgrading

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,690
the the the Drupal module that helped

00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:52,550
test the the the development of the

00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:55,790
development prior to test the the site

00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,500
itself there haven't been any efforts to

00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,300
try and upgrade that that I'm aware of

00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,610
and partly it's trying to go off and get

00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:05,090
to to finding a way to go off into it to

00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:06,950
incorporate Axe core or Palli or there

00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,020
is a tenon module that you can you can

00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,400
download for your site that that will

00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,020
plug-in and I think there's both the

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,210
Drupal 7 in Drupal 8 version of that

00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:17,690
that's probably the closest that that we

00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:21,140
have for that style of Drupal module to

00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,970
provide accessibility evaluations but

00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:27,050
but hopefully that will change and

00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:29,800
especially I mean the the chrome toolbar

00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:33,140
that's that's the lighthouse to of

00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,730
developer tools that involves a an

00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,230
accessibility component that a lot of

00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,860
people don't know about so that actually

00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:42,560
will test your page using axe core to go

00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,270
off and to evaluate it for for basic

00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,650
accessibility to and most of your

00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,230
developers will probably have that

00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,910
chrome developer

00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,740
toolkit enabled and using it all the

00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,859
time so convincing them to go off and to

00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,540
use the the the lighthouse web

00:48:53,859 --> 00:49:18,099
accessibility tool is probably an easy

00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:20,680
and easy sell I don't think so there is

00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:21,940
a tool though that can check your your I

00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,460
have to I'll send you a link or

00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:27,490
something but it has it will test your

00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:30,160
content for obvious accessibility errors

00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,020
and like the reading level and whether

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,109
or not you know it's got all these like

00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:37,270
little facets and stuff and actually one

00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:38,740
of the presenters at one of our monthly

00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:41,320
meetups is the one who told us all about

00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,790
it but it's not it's like an external

00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,320
tool and I think that's maybe the reason

00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,480
why people haven't updated the

00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:49,270
accessibility tool inside of Drupal is

00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,460
there are all these great very nuanced

00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,079
great tools out there already that can

00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,230
do some of these very specific things

00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:59,109
and with great reliability that maybe

00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,490
they haven't wanted to do that but we

00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:01,960
can I can get you a link for that

00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,069
particular one if you're talking about

00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,650
content specific but there's another one

00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:15,760
right the Khan Academy

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:18,280
he's called total 11 wide totally and he

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,650
can put on people pretty can also have I

00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,970
got to Chrome taken and the cool thing

00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:26,890
about it is it texts all of the front

00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:29,950
page stuff like so that could be for the

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,630
content editor stuff so what it does is

00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:35,170
you know scan it you know saying oops

00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:37,060
this ear consider doing X so we're not

00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:39,280
only toes it was wrong like how to fix

00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,170
it so it pretty cool for like heading so

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,099
back haiti skipped a heading makes it

00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,650
had a bore

00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:51,010
or something like that and bullet list

00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:53,349
so it's totally tota another good one

00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:55,240
for that is wave tool and that also will

00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:57,280
do the same thing it'll tell you what's

00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,130
wrong but it'll also tell you why it's

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,140
wrong and explain how to fake

00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:03,720
and then there's another tab on it for

00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:05,940
outline and it'll give you an outline of

00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,410
the page structure so that you can make

00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,370
sure that all of your headings are

00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:12,900
nested semantically that's almost like a

00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,490
difference because it's market versus

00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,530
like actual content you know you mean

00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,510
like yeah but it's check I mean it's not

00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:20,190
until they've put it up but once they've

00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:22,260
put it up they can see if I used

00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:25,290
headings properly or am I using them for

00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:36,270
decoration things like that there's a

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:37,740
tool for everything I didn't talk about

00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:47,910
justing the questions I don't think I

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:49,590
mentioned lighthouse prior I'm guessing

00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:51,540
that it's somewhere around 25%

00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:53,460
there was the closest evaluation that

00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:57,030
I've seen of this recently was was the

00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,560
UK government did an assessment of these

00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,120
various tools and they created a dummy

00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,770
page that had had a number of

00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,750
accessibility problems with it and said

00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:05,670
you know they tested these tools and

00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:08,820
including ones like site improve and and

00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:10,230
looked at how did how they did and I

00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,290
don't have the numbers offhand but if

00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:15,870
you search for the UK government

00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:18,780
accessibility you know tool check

00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:23,490
checklist or survey they won't be able

00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:26,630
to find that it's this really great page

00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,630
where everything's like broken

00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,910
oh so this is what I put I put this

00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:39,490
slide back up because we have the

00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:41,819
contributed accessibility modules for d8

00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:44,140
and those are the ones that have been

00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:45,880
deemed as excessive tagged with

00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,369
accessibility and then there's notes

00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,710
like the one with the quail jus and

00:52:48,369 --> 00:53:00,970
being a security issue so that might be

00:52:50,710 --> 00:53:03,750
a good reference so the the there's an

00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:07,770
issue to try and add the ckeditor

00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:10,900
accessibility plugin to core but that is

00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:14,440
postponed and because the parent project

00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:17,290
C key editor is they have to go off and

00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,319
fix the the the they have to swap out

00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:22,780
quail for AK score or Polly in order

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,720
before that can take place so until C

00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:29,730
key editor fixes that problem we aren't

00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,730
going to be upgrading that in in core I

00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,990
think I've questioned over there

00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:35,530
it's a good question so it is first of

00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,720
all I do have a github page that

00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:41,230
references best practices for

00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:43,000
accessibility procurement and I think

00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:46,270
that this is a big part of it because a

00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,690
lot of a lot of organizations say you

00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:51,190
know must meet WK 2.0 double-a and

00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,600
that's the bullet point that they list

00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,580
in the site and that's a best-case

00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:58,270
scenario I saw one from a municipal or

00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:00,310
municipal organization that said w c RG

00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:01,780
2.0 double-a is like they got the

00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:03,670
acronym wrong so like well what is the

00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,530
legal implications for an area for an

00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:09,910
RFP response that didn't get the AK you

00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:11,860
know Akram acronym right for this yeah

00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:13,090
exactly and you can do that but you just

00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,410
don't have the budget for it like

00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,630
there's you know you have to add a zero

00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:17,860
or two at the end of your your your in

00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:21,160
order to go up and meet that Triple A

00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,440
compliance but the but in terms of B

00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,350
Pat's I mean V pets have being reformed

00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,260
recently so they're better now it's

00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:32,260
still problematic because the vpats

00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:35,350
don't actually require a third-party

00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,080
evaluation to see that this is this is

00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:39,520
anything more than a sales job and

00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,200
nobody in the Drupal Association you

00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,790
know nobody an accessibility team is

00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,630
eight has been interested in pursuing

00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:48,340
the extensive sales piece that needs to

00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:51,400
happen in order to go off in the field

00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,160
in the V Pat in order to make claims and

00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,450
assertions that may or may not be true

00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,980
in order to go off and make this a

00:55:55,450 --> 00:56:01,390
valuable document for procurement

00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:02,390
purposes because it's what does be

00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:05,260
better

00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:07,340
our voluntary accessibility yes

00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,260
something or other volunteer its it's a

00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,780
government it's a government you say US

00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:14,390
government accessibility procurement

00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:16,580
loophole or not they they put up so that

00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:19,100
they can go off and put on two vendors

00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:21,050
you know is your your your site

00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,880
accessible if you've got a vpad

00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:24,890
statement then we've covered her ass and

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,840
we can make sure that that we've we've

00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,640
gone off and done our due diligence

00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,900
because they have the vpad statement

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,090
therefore the accessibility problems

00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,980
aren't aren't our fault that's it - like

00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,960
why people don't want to touch it it was

00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:39,080
because of the legal implications and

00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,580
the liability so I you know what I mean

00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,620
I'm sure you can find something open

00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:46,360
source or free on the web but I'm not

00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:46,360
really sure how specific that is here

00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:06,220
you could add it to our documentation if

00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:07,780
you want to help write it I would think

00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,050
so I mean if we could put something like

00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:12,880
a template or something so if you wanted

00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:15,670
to go from put up a Google Doc or a

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,620
github page to go off and start this

00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:19,000
they'll be happy to promote it and if

00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,550
you're able to take the lead on this and

00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,930
trying to build something that's a

00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:25,480
credible vpad statement that allows

00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:26,590
Drupal to have a leg up over others and

00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,210
it would be interesting to go from to

00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,650
see well what have what does the

00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,040
WordPress community done do they have

00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,950
anything

00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,320
what have have any other open source

00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,940
community done generally what what was

00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,530
being done for the US government to say

00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,000
okay well it was it was accessible

00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,500
enough for the White House it's not

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,470
anymore because they switch to WordPress

00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:46,900
but in a successful enough for for so

00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:48,460
many other lead government agencies that

00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,520
it's it's accessible enough and it

00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,500
doesn't really require a beep at so but

00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:59,940
that may not count in this day and age

00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:59,940
so we promise to adhere to work AG 4.0

00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:16,570
well thank you for there's no more

00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:17,860
questions opportunities there's a box

00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,210
right after this if you have very

00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,830
specific questions or you want to talk

00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:22,840
about any things that we talked about

00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,550
today and more in depth and then

00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,740
tomorrow I guess tomorrow's Wednesday

00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:29,230
right the accessible editor and then

00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:30,910
also a smarter way to test accessibility

00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,770
those are both coming up tomorrow and

00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:38,620
and we'll have these slides will tweet

00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:40,810
about them and send them a link guys we

00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:45,040
can post up something and retweet that

00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:47,230
so thank you guys one more thing we are

00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,170

anybody has a question that they didn't

00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:56,710
think of today and they want to swing by

00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:59,140
I don't know what it is but I will tweet

00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:01,890
it and I'll hashtag it DrupalCon so that

00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,890
you guys can find out

00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:08,250
