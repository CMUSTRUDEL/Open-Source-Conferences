Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Taking Images to the Next Level (in Drupal 8)
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Quit fighting with designers and clients over image restrictions; fight Drupal instead, and win!

In Drupal 8, core provides more image functionality than ever, but what if you want to go beyond the basics? What if you need more choices? This session will cover a variety of ways to bend Drupal images to your will, including:



Uploading and rendering SVG images via custom and/or contrib modules (and the security implications therein) 
Creating a bitmap fallback for your SVG field
Letting content creators choose from multiple aspect ratios and/or image styles
Using contrib modules to preserve the most important parts of your image (and ways to get around it when that's not an option)
Setting completely separate images as sources in a responsive picture tag
Retaining your will to live (and your code functionality) when the Media module comes along and throws a wrench in everything we just spoke about.


To get the most out of this session, attendees should be familiar with basic theming and site-building.
