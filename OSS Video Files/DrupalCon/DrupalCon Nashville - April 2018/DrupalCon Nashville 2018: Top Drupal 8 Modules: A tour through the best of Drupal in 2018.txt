okay since we've got a pretty full room

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,849
I think we can start maybe a minute or

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,759
two early just because it is a shorter

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,230
session so hello welcome to my session

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,640
very excited to be here to talk with you

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,650
today we're going to be taking a guided

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,869
tour through the best of Drupal 8 in

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,250
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,260
this session is based off of a

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,369
long-running blog series I have over at

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,239
media current calm my goal today is to

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,899
share with you

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:42,629
modules that our team uses every single

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:44,730
day on a multitude of projects so first

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,250
a quick plug for the contribution

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:53,489
Sprint's on Friday and we'll have some

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:56,699
of our folks attending let's take a look

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,170
at today's agenda after a short intro

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,059
we'll set the table by asking the

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,210
question how many modules do I actually

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,439
need on a given project then we'll take

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,880
a look at the essentials list for 2018

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,619
I'll go through each module briefly to

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,900
give you a feel for what it does and how

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,290
you would go about installing or

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,869
configuring it after that we'll go

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,770
through a list of honorable mentions

00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,930
these were modules that are not

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,530
necessarily essential on every project

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,920
but still worthy of consideration and

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,869
then we'll wrap up with QA won't have a

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,040
ton of time but well I have a little bit

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,329
of time for some questions first a

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,729
little bit about media current I'm very

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,430
proud to be representing media current

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,610
today and who is media current we are a

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,729
full service digital agency focused on

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,259
open source development design and

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:51,259
strategy for enterprise organizations

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,880
now a little bit about me

00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,780
I've been working with Drupal for a long

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,670
time as far back as Drupal 4.6 and I've

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,920
enjoyed putting together a top modules

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,719
list for many years so I figured it was

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,719
finally time to present one in person

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,689
now before we get started

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,519
like to answer the critical question for

00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:18,470
people who are maybe new to Drupal and

00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,430
you might be asking the question how

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,620
many modules do I actually need so

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,329
newcomers to Drupal often want to

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,099
download and install a bunch of modules

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:31,730
and I would definitely encourage you to

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:33,860
play around with new modules that being

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,540
that being said you need to understand

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,390
that every module you add is like a

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,690
plant you need water or a new puppy you

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:44,150
need to keep from messing on the carpet

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,650
the utility of the module needs to

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,480
exceed the effort to maintain that

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,970
module otherwise you're just going to

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:55,639
create a maintenance problem for

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:57,290
yourself okay on to the list first we're

00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,000
going to go through what I might

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,190
character characterized as the

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,879
essentials list these are modules that

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,409
we use on most projects one thing I

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,109
should note in today's presentation is

00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:10,639
that I'm assuming most of you have used

00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,040
Drupal you know how to do some basic

00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,379
site building tasks like adding a field

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:21,109
to a content type or configuring a

00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:23,780
module in the admin and here it is

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:26,030
here's the list now

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,879
I should mention there's thousands

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,669
thousands of modules out there they can

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,220
be hard to sort through that being said

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,609
there are some projects that rise about

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,919
the others this list certainly like any

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:43,250
last it's subjective but it is based on

00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:47,870
real project use usage and over ten

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:51,310
years of Drupal experience alright so

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,310
let's go through this list one by one

00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,819
another thing I should mention we're not

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,129
going to be able to spend a lot of time

00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,750
on each module my goal here today is to

00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,329
give you just enough information to

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,329
understand what the module does and why

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:07,069
you might like to use it if you do have

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,530
questions out asked that you might save

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,180
them for the end my initial session

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,370
description said we were gonna have a

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,780
leisurely stroll through these modules

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,359
but it's going to be a little bit less

00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,190
like a Vienna tour and you know a little

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,969
bit more like a rollercoaster so a

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,700
little bit more fast-paced okay so let's

00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:29,250
get after it number one an admin toolbar

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,410
now this is this is an easy one this

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,260
this module you might already think is

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,760
in court but it isn't we use it on

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,550
pretty much every project because

00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,470
navigating through menus in Drupal is a

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,470
real pain without rollover menus

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,200
component libraries now this is going to

00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,930
make your life easier if you do any

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,760
custom theming it's definitely more of

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,250
an intermediate level module but it's

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,420
one that we use a lot so I've made the

00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,420
essentials list for that reason

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,570
davell now this is a very handy module

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,370
it also might be more of an intermediate

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,700
module but it can definitely help you

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:15,960
debug problems in your twig templates as

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,820
an example another feature that's pretty

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,850
handy even for beginners is the ability

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,800
to generate dummy content so there's a

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,040
little UI for that and it's really

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:33,330
helpful to generate dummy content for

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:36,780
testing now this is a fun one media

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,310
entity browser so this looks similar to

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,180
kind of stuff that Reese was showing

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,160
this morning there's a lot of work with

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,530
Drupal core right now moving more of the

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,480
media stuff into core so you have it

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,550
better out of this box experience for

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,550
now a lot of it a lot of this is handled

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,530
in contribs a media entity browser great

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,240
module it gives you it gives you the

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,090
ability to have this nice little library

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,740
pop-up where you can upload browse

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,860
search for different types of media on

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,370
your site now there are a couple steps

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,070
to configure this module so when you add

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,530
a field you're going to want to add a

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,810
entity reference field and when you

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,860
configure it you'll want to select which

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:22,260
bundles you want to use and then what

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,400
actually makes the library pop-up thing

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,620
show up is on the form display tab for

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,830
your content type you're going to need

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,690
to configure it to render the entity

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,210
browser formatter and it's got a bunch

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,370
of different options there so that's how

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,460
that's how it works now if that's

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,050
confusing to you I would suggest

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,949
maybe you want to take a look at the

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,419
lightning or thunder and saw profiles

00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:49,340
they they will have this pre-configured

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:57,830
for you and so we'll talk more about

00:06:49,340 --> 00:07:00,530
lightning later on field group this is a

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,940
nice little module my audio is really

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,650
loud does it sound okay okay just making

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,000
sure

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,560
now this module will simply let you

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,160
group your fields together in a more

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,620
organized way so you can create these

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,720
groups on the manage form display tab

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,639
that we just talked about and you've got

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,289
several options for organizing fields so

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,509
you can do like accordions tabs things

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:28,160
like that and so that's going to make

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:36,320
life easier on your content

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:38,780
administrators okay Google Analytics

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,090
this module is easy to install you

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,759
pretty much just need to have your UA ID

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,440
and then you're good so as soon as you

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,380
plug that in the basic tracking is going

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,360
to work now there of course there are

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:59,469
some advanced options but most people

00:07:50,360 --> 00:08:02,750
start with that basic tracking link it

00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:05,990
so this handy little guy it gives you an

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,210
autocomplete pop up inside of WYSIWYG so

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,370
it's much easier to add links this way

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,169
rather than having to hunt around for

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,669
the internal path yourself you're able

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:17,469
to just type in the title of the content

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,469
add the link that way

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,720
metatag so my coworker Damien McKenna

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,720
and current hotel roommate has worked on

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,289
metatag for many years along with many

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,640
others in the community

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:41,140
this module lets you configure all of

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,300
your meta tags for SEO purposes so all

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,820
you do is add the meta tag field to any

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:49,060
Content type where you want to collect

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,709
meta information and so usually you're

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,950
going to add this to all of your content

00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,950
types

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,050
panels so panels has been around for

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,339
many years this is a great tool for it's

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,050
a great site building tool for creating

00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:10,480
custom layouts with a drag-and-drop

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:13,810
interface so prior to Drupal 8 we used

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,670
this a bunch at media current da we

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,640
still use it some but maybe not as much

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,529
and you'll notice there is a big effort

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,470
to pour a lot of the different panels

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,600
features in decor most recently we've

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,520
got a the new layout building tool you

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,190
saw Driss demoed some of that this

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,079
morning so it is definitely a tool that

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,850
you want to get familiar with as there

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,550
is an effort to do more and more of that

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,320
in inside of core like I said we use

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,029
this that media current we we also tend

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,570
to like the paragraphs approach and so

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:46,930
we'll talk about that next

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:49,810
paragraphs okay this is maybe my

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,240
favorite module paragraphs it creates a

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,360
new entity type so you can think of it

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,089
like a mini content type and there are

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,100
many use cases the one that's kind of

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:02,709
gained steam across a community is

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,730
replacing the ubiquitous body field with

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:08,740
a supercharged two paragraphs field so

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,480
instead of making the body field like

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,540
the center paste centerpiece of your

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,820
page you have this super supercharged

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,000
paragraph field that gives you all kinds

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,649
of structure content so editors love it

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,290
because they can build these robust

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:28,480
pages developers love having structured

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:30,339
content so we have a bunch of paragraph

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,529
types we might reuse on multiple

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,770
projects so let's say you want to drop

00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:37,000
in a testimonial or a quote

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:41,230
and we'll have a paragraph type that

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,320
captures the quote and the author then

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,030
you might want to drop in FAQ there's

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,100
the possibilities are really endless you

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:51,330
can any sort of paragraph types you can

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:54,940
think of you can create mix-and-match

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:57,370
reorder them on the page what I like

00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,110
about it in comparison to panels is that

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:03,160
you're not having to train your content

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,660
admins on a different interface so they

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,480
can still do all of their work basically

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:14,550
on that same content editing screen and

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:16,780
so we like that pathauto

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,910
so this is a module you're going to

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,920
you're going to want to have it lets you

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,460
set up your clean alias patterns for all

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,920
of your content if you want all of your

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,260
blogs to have the path slash blog slash

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,120
title with hyphens in it instead of

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:38,260
spaces this is the module that's going

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:40,330
to let you configure that the redirect

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,690
module is another module we use pretty

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,550
much on every project if you have 301

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,940
redirects you're going to want to use

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,290
this module one of the handy little

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,930
features is that it automatically

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,410
creates a 301 redirect if you change

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,540
your path alias and this is good so that

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,910
you don't accidentally 404 your own site

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,960
visitors and there's other handy

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:13,320
configurations in here you know there's

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:15,550
a bunch of different options search API

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,880
now this is another one of my favorite

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,040
modules search api most people come to

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,870
realize pretty quickly that the Drupal

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,440
core search is is terrible

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:29,260
and so the Search API module it's more

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,210
powerful it's more flexible you can use

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,520
a database index initially and you can

00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,800
swap it out for a solar based index and

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,230
you don't break your site because search

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,450
api abstracts things out really well

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,890
I like the search api pages module it

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,930
makes it simple to create your site

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,300
search page and there's other ways of

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,560
doing that but I like that module

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,110
overall there is a bit of a learning

00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,490
curve but it's pretty manageable and I

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,879
think it's worth the effort just because

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:04,190
the the core search isn't very good no

00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:07,040
offense if you've worked on that okay

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:10,310
who likes managing sitemap.xml probably

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,470
nobody but you know you need sitemap.xml

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,959
for google to know how to index your

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,819
site so this module is great because you

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,209
can pretty much enable it and forget it

00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:24,100
you have some pretty straightforward

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,100
configuration if you need extra controls

00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:32,779
stage File proxy this is a nice little

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,360
developer module so one of the annoying

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,949
things with working on a site is that

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,379
all of your images are broken when you

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:42,800
test the site locally unless you keep

00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,990
copying your files over so staged file

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,269
proxy allows you to just grab the images

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,579
that you need kind of as you need them

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:53,779
when you load the page it's very simple

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:58,850
to configure and very handy highly

00:13:53,779 --> 00:14:00,500
recommend okay finally on the essentials

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,759
list let's not forget the web form

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,430
module this module is awesome because it

00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:10,339
makes it easy to make any and all kinds

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,170
of forms on your website you have plenty

00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:15,470
of widgets and configuration at your

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,360
disposal this is a must-have module if

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:23,540
you plan on managing your forms in

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,939
Drupal okay let's move on to another

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,649
list this one is might be more fun just

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:28,850
because it's less likely that you've

00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,699
heard of every single one of these

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,230
modules they these didn't make the

00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:39,889
essentials list but there's still some

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:41,809
goodies in here and here's the list one

00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:44,029
note I included the lightening install

00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:46,550
profile project which is of course not a

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,170
module it is a collection of modules and

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,259
it includes many of the ones that we did

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:55,129
talk about today and we'll talk about

00:14:51,259 --> 00:15:00,060
that one in a few minutes okay

00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:04,200
number one ckeditor media embed

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,000
as you're probably aware a lot of

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,970
content out there on the web includes

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,870
social media call-outs things like

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,600
Twitter quote YouTube embedded video and

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:18,830
this module simply makes it easier to

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,830
include that content in your wizzy wave

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:26,310
okay let's talk about lightbox so lots

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,460
of sites use the the lightbox plugin for

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,920
media content color box is a popular

00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:36,450
library library and of course there's a

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,960
Drupal module at the same name it's easy

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:42,570
for beginners to configure and install

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,400
and so yeah it's uh you will have to

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,870
download a library to your to your

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:52,710
libraries folder but otherwise it's

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:54,150
pretty easy to set up all right what

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:58,140
about e-commerce you've probably seen

00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,900
some different commerce agencies they

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,390
got their own little section in the

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,620
sponsor area so what about e-commerce if

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,030
you've done any e-commerce you've

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,300
probably heard about the commerce suite

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:11,070
of modules for Drupal this allows you to

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,950
add products to your site and checkouts

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,510
and payment options and all that there

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:21,450
is a lot of configuration but it's

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:24,180
actually not too bad to learn okay onto

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,640
drop zone j/s I like this module for

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,460
drag-and-drop file uploads pretty much

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,770
everywhere you go on the web you need to

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,150
add a file you have a drag-and-drop

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:36,750
upload options so why not have that on

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:39,090
your Drupal site and I should mention

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,320
there's an extra installation step just

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,020
like color box where you need to

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,070
download the drop the drop zone library

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,070
into your libraries folder

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,290
okay let's talk about entity embed this

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,540
module lets you embed any drupal entity

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,820
pretty much anywhere and there's a

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,290
million things you can do with it

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,839
perhaps the most common use case though

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,829
is that you can use it to embed media

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,390
inside of WYSIWYG if you remember we a

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,480
minute ago we talked about the media

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,490
entity browser module this module pairs

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,100
nicely with that because you're able to

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,470
launch that same kind of library pop up

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,880
inside of your WYSIWYG the same one that

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,140
you're using on a field you can use

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:30,020
inside a WYSIWYG one caveat is it it is

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:31,940
more of a pain to configure okay now on

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,220
to a simpler module the external links

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,890
module pretty much every project I work

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,630
on at some point the client asks can we

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,460
make external links open up in a new

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,160
window or tab and so the answer is yes

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,290
you can all you need to do is enable

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,790
this module click a checkbox and all

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:53,830
your external links will open up in a

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:55,880
new window alright mmm focal point so

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,280
the problem we're trying to solve here

00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,980
is supporting different kinds of crops

00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,020
from the same source image right the

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,700
solution this solution in particular is

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,070
one that that I like just because it's

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:11,270
maybe the easiest on the developer and

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,770
the editor this module tries to crop

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,690
around the focus of the image that

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:18,110
you're able to set with a little pointer

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,000
and so it'll crop from that focus

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,650
instead of just arbitrarily dropping

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,570
from the center which doesn't always

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,570
look good especially on portrait images

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,170
the geolocation module now there's a lot

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,770
of configuration options for this but I

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,840
like that it makes it pretty simple to

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:42,320
capture a point on a map and render that

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:48,320
map in a field lots of nice options to

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:50,990
configure it but very easy to set up do

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,929
you ever get spam well there's lots of

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,510
options for anti-spam measures one of

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,130
them is certainly using CAPTCHAs what I

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,440
like about honeypot is that it doesn't

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,179
burden the user to have to fill out this

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,879
extra step

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:09,249
and it and it is pretty effective some

00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:12,549
something to check out all right the

00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:14,409
lightning install profile now I should

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,239
mention that install profiles and

00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:17,799
distributions are good to play play

00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:21,249
around with you can learn more about

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,629
triple that way and increase more more

00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:24,159
or less alluded to that sort of thing

00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:26,409
with out-of-the-box initiative it's a

00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,909
good way to learn what I like about

00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,820
lightning is that it's more of a general

00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:33,099
purpose distribution they focus a lot on

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:39,309
the editing experience and media

00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:40,719
management stuff like I said it's a good

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,309
teaching tool because you're able to see

00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:43,599
some of these modules in action like the

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,279
media stuff you're able to see it

00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,259
already configured and then you can

00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,669
examine the configuration and learn

00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,109
exactly how it works which is going to

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:57,820
make it easier if you need to do your

00:19:50,109 --> 00:20:00,070
own implementation now for another

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,219
pretty simple but effective module the

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,809
scheduler module lets you schedule the

00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:10,450
publishing and unpublishing of your

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:11,979
content note that you are going to need

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,830
to use cron for this to work so you'll

00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:24,129
need to make sure that cron is working

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:27,339
and configured correctly the slick

00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:30,460
module is slick this module has a lot of

00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:34,719
related projects but it lets you set up

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,279
you know slideshows and carousels one

00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:38,349
big caveat is that you're going to need

00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:43,809
to download a library 2 to get this

00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:45,460
working but once you figure that out

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:48,099
there's a lot of good integrations it

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,289
gives you different filled formatters it

00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:56,589
integrates with media with views with

00:20:50,289 --> 00:21:00,669
paragraphs that's really nice texana me

00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:03,399
access fix now this project might get

00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:04,899
merged into core at some point it

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:07,859
addresses the fact that core doesn't

00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:11,589
have enough granular permissions for

00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:14,480
taxonomy so we had a client once Delita

00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:16,880
a whole vocabulary and that wasn't fun

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,830
so this module helps prevent that by

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,180
giving them the right amount of

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:26,540
permission so you don't give them too

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:30,650
many these rest reference last but not

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,470
least on this list this might be my new

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:36,130
favorite module and it's nice you can

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,530
select a block view from the field and

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,300
renders it out on a page so you know I

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,100
talked about paragraphs we we have a

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,730
paragraph type that pretty much just has

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:51,020
a views reference field and so yeah you

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:53,000
can embed a view wherever you want it's

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,920
good if you have a client maybe wants a

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,660
little bit of site building permissions

00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,030
and you don't want to give them too much

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,070
but it gives them a lot of control to be

00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,110
able to set up a view and render it in a

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,450
page and reorder it on the page if it's

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:11,210
in paragraphs so definitely worth

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:12,980
checking out okay and if you all look

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,820
under your seats I've got a prize free

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:19,340
actually no idea sorry I've got a link

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,230
so if you're interested in trying some

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,900
of these modules out and you know a

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,260
little bit about composer I've created a

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:30,350
just a simple project on github it has

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,510
all the modules I mentioned today and it

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,670
just will download them for you the

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,040
extra benefit here is that it includes

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,240
those extra libraries that I mentioned

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,250
it'll download those for you

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,290
it doesn't install anything all it does

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,210
is download all the modules instead of

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,700
you hunting around for them yourself and

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,500
then you just install Drupal the normal

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,760
way and that gives you an opportunity to

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,260
just play around with it

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,600
it doesn't include lightning which

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,700
itself is a distribution so I'd also

00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:01,670
recommend you download that and play

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:04,460
around with that okay and that's it and

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,290
we made it before the time when it's so

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,810
good we got a few minutes for questions

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:16,070
thank you very much stop

00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:20,270
okay yeah so we've got a little bit of

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,590
time for questions the questions like

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,360
why didn't you include this or that

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,400
module and I'll say I don't know I just

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,200
then okay we've got a hand up and now we

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,730
I think there's a mic over here or you

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:38,390
can shout it out and I'll try to repeat

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:39,740
it either way paragraphs in translation

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,720
okay so the question is how have you

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,720
been able to handle paragraphs and

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,670
translations so and we actually use

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,380
paragraphs on a big translation site

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:53,600
visit the USA comm it's it's got 15

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,970
different gos lots of translation going

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,910
on now the limitation with paragraphs is

00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:01,400
that you can't translate the paragraph

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:06,550
entity itself but you can translate the

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,550
fields on on the paragraph so

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,780
occasionally you'll run into some issues

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,940
with paragraphs but since the fields

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,700
themselves are translatable it's it's

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,320
still doable like I said there are some

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
gotchas in there don't have time to walk

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,680
through that today I actually presented

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,690
on translation last year so watch that

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:32,020
presentation oh we talked about it a

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:32,020
little bit any other questions

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,310
if there's no other questions I will be

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,600
up here for a few minutes while the next

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,660
speaker is probably setting up so if you

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,280
want to ask me something in person

00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,330
go ahead thanks for coming everybody

00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,330
appreciate it

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:57,720
I hate the whole people there they're

00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,830
like ready to get out of there you know

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,830
I want to go

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:10,620
Gundersen it's an x-ray

00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,250
okay particularly it works a bike

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,450
