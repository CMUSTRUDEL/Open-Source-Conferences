Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Maintaining Design Consistency Across Every Channel
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	With the growing shift towards a decoupled future a company’s presence is going to be represented by an ever-expanding collection of websites, apps, and talking speakers. 

Maintaining design and tone consistency across those channels will be challenging but if done right, it can allow you to enter markets more quickly while keeping the style and tone of your company aligned.



In this talk we’ll discuss:

Getting everyone, including leadership, onboard with valuing  strong, centralized design
How to work out what should—and what shouldn’t—go into a style guide
What we can do to make “style guide” stop being a four-letter word
How to create a system that works for your company. (Any size company!)
How to communicate that design to teams that have to implement it—other designers, developers of all stripes, and managers of those teams


Who should attend:

EVERYONE
Business owners and leaders who want to leverage design to grow
Designers and Marketers who want to do great work
Developers who want to share this talk with the rest of their team because this makes dev go faster.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
so I've got a four-year-old daughter I

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,299
just kind of put her on a leash let her

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,389
run in the backyard and lay down go to

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,830
sleep so the session before mine they

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,469
were talking about usability research

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,089
with children and you know they're

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,800
talking about how like kids may not know

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,600
how to use a track pad they may be more

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,760
familiar with a mouse well my daughter

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,960
loves touchscreens and I can tell

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,380
because the television in my living room

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,849
has peanut butter spread all across it

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,070
until I trained her and told her that no

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,009
it is not a touchscreen I'm controlling

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,160
it with my phone so now she fights me

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,399
for my phone so that's not good

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,559
that's not good so so how far is

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,800
everyone traveled does anyone not from

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,860
the not from North America in the room

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:51,809
travel from further than that no okay

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,820
anybody from Mexico or Canada oh very

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,300
nice very nice glad to have you guys

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,960
here

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,350
I hope the border wasn't too bad let's

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,750
see I'm just trying to kill time here

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,220
letting people filter and so if anybody

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,700
has any questions that's not related to

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,400
my talk that would be great yeah so I

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,140
myself I'm coming from Pennsylvania

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,460
middle of nowhere Pennsylvania every

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,810
mode of transportation that I took to

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,460
get to DrupalCon was late it was

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,560
fantastic

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,150
I take the train from my hometown to

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,610
Pittsburgh to catch the airport and it

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,259
was an hour and a half late and so then

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,930
got on my plane and it was three hours

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,119
late so I plenty of time to write my

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,920
talk in train stations and plane

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,920
stations so it was nice it was a good

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,240
time so so we've got about another two

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,369
minutes we're gonna let people continue

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,900
to filter in once again there's a lot of

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,430
people in the back there are some empty

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,409
seats up here there's some empty seats

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,950
over there get to know your neighbor

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,950
scoot over

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,920
so for those of us just joining us in

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,420
the back there are some empty seats over

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,590
here and up here if you don't mind

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,590
getting cozy with some people

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:49,220
all right we just got a few more seconds

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,780
before we start so I'm a big fan and not

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,410
punishing the punctual so we will begin

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,850
on time now so hello everyone and thank

you very much for attending this talk

00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,200
maintaining design consistency across

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,290
every channel this is a topic that I'm

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,940
very excited to talk to you about today

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,280
I'd like to start by introducing myself

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,110
my name is Randy oast and you can find

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
me online as amazing Rando at least

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,400
everywhere that I can manage to snag the

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,260
handle my personal work history includes

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,760
a decade of working in higher education

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,080
at the University of Pittsburgh as a

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,359
design manager working on

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,340
university-wide branding after that I

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,560
spent spent about a half a decade

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,960
working at a 40-person plus marketing

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,490
agency where I oversaw the digital team

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,400
that created websites and digital

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,990
experiences for all of our clients now

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,730
I'm proud to be a web chef at four

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,470
kitchens where I help our clients create

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,880
rich experiences and meet their goals so

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,270
everyone is talking about how the future

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,130
is decoupled Drupal and WordPress are

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,169
both pushing hard for this and with good

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,070
reason

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,750
separating data management from

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,050
presentation allows for amazing things

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,900
to happen so your content goes

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,930
everywhere that you want it to go

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:03,770
websites apps devices special content

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,290
going to amp RSS feeds Alexa Roku iPhone

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,480
apps blogs micro sites web sites it goes

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,530
everywhere you need it to be and there

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,900
have been a lot of talks about the

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,919
technical progress of decoupling I'm

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,330
sure that some of you maybe have

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,010
attended some today or yesterday or

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,710
planned to for the rest of Drupal con

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,660
but what about the design and marketing

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,070
side of things when do we get our

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:28,430
decoupling so so how do designers and

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,780
marketers keep everything aligned so and

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,120
that's what I'm gonna talk to you about

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,430
today how do you handle large-scale

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,910
design consistency or as I like to put

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,880
it too coupling for designers the first

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,720
the fun for me the very first thing that

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,120
you have to do is you have to get

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,220
everyone invested right in the process

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,450
this may seem like an obvious first step

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,620
and it is but that's because it's vital

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,750
maintaining consistency is a task that

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,289
requires discipline and pays dividends

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,319
when you do it right

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,120
there needs to be a central authority to

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,550
oversee this to maintain this

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,979
consistency that happens this can be a

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,509
person this could be an office sometimes

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,080
it's his chief design officer

00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:12,970
maybe you got one or it's like a CMO

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,220
chief marketing officer someone who's in

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,800
charge of identity and design and

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,490
visuals and interactions and this whole

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,319
kit and caboodle and process by making

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,660
someone responsible for this you empower

00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,460
them to maintain this network which is a

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,190
very important word and also to grow

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:35,620
this framework so that it can serve your

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:38,500
needs so the the big value is

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,300
consistency in the design experience for

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,949
centralizing for centralizing design

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,150
sorry I was moving this has really got a

00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:47,680
small range so so let's talk about the

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,440
value of design consistency so that we

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,840
can get everyone on board the first

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,569
value is usability and learnability are

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,979
improved when patterns are used so what

00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,960
this means is that the learned knowledge

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:01,360
can be transferred to new contexts

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,220
quickly this is how you build rapport

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,099
with your audiences as you expand to new

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,440
devices by having this consistency users

00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,720
know what to expect they know what the

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,280
signup process is like they can start on

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,130
their phones and end things on their

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,669
tablets or vice versa having an

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,190
inconsistent interface allowing like the

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:23,770
MDOT shop to do the mobile site and to

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,710
allow the AIAW shop to do your your

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,250
iPhone app and so on and so forth leads

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,479
to inconsistent interface considerations

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,310
and it's like talking to users in

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,840
several different languages only

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,539
advanced users will be able to finish

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,430
tasks in a scenario like that so keep it

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:43,270
consistent and build a relationship to

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,740
last with your users the next value is

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,099
the freedom to focus on the important

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,229
things

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:50,139
we are all very busy individuals we have

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,759
a lot of things to do so we need to stop

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,009
spending time solving the same things

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,740
over and over again over and over again

00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,570
by having a framework in place designers

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,909
and marketers can focus on the important

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,710
goals work on that killer promotional

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:04,089
art or a motivating call to action

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,680
instead of fretting over what to do

00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,250
about the footer and reinventing the

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,560
wheel

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:13,460
get to your solutions faster by having

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,010
this design framework bringing new

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,750
people up to speed takes less time when

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,340
you have documentation and tools for

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,350
them to learns the learn the ins and

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,170
outs of your identity your branding and

00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,850
your interface this also applies to

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,700
adding new teams or working with outside

00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,330
vendors there's always this this

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,220
reticence to to add vendors or outside

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,930
contractors to help with the team

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,570
because that onboarding process is so

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:42,800
expensive in time and knowledge sharing

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,360
is difficult so by having a framework to

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,680
work from you're able to spend those

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,900
people up faster if they have a question

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,400
you can send them a link to a URL where

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,710
you've already written out how to

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,690
explain that as opposed to having to

00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,190
actually take the time to explain it eat

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,160
to each individual person that you're

00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,810
onboarding so this design consistency

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,820
helps to reduce this friction involved

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,980
with getting new people on board and

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,210
with getting results so you can spin up

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,480
people faster it also lastly means that

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,860
you have faster entry into new markets

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,870
you've done a lot of heavy design

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,570
thinking to provide this framework these

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,800
interactions you know your users you

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,150
know how they use your product or

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,970
service and you've built this framework

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,560
to serve them and so you can actually

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,500
one of her new markets emerge you can

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,390
enter those markets quickly so for

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,700
instance like talking cylinders and

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,610
virtual reality or some of the like you

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,080
know the newest areas in which we can

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,470
start generating creating and moving

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,450
content and when you have your design

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:46,670
framework set up you can address those

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:51,170
needs faster so what goes into this

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:53,210
style guide so now that we have everyone

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,480
on board for consistency let's define

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,190
what this looks like to me I use the

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,750
term style guide I know that there are a

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,880
lot of people who like brand standards

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,230
and industry standards there's a lot of

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,360
different terms for these sorts of

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:09,140
things and I generally call it a style

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,680
guide so let's talk about what this

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:16,190
style guide is so for starters a style

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,960
guide is your North Star this is when

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,730
you're designing new interfaces or

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,040
solving interaction patterns

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,959
your style guide is where you start you

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,209
reference what has come before you

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,820
reference what you have asset wise and

00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:32,209
by asset that can mean everything from

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,519
components that you've defined guidance

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:36,230
on how to write editorial copy you know

00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,420
whatever the case might be and you're

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,250
able to reference that and making sure

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,199
that everything is consistent and that

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,779
you're solving for new problems and

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:47,480
bringing those those into the fold so

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:50,029
this has to be your North Star whenever

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,810
it comes to creating this design

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:56,029
consistency so a style guide is a

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,380
toolbox for creation so it's also not in

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,070
addition to being this North Star it's

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,899
also a toolbox so it has to be a living

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,100
thing that feeds into the things that

00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,750
you make and we're going to talk about

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,750
some of the ways in which style guys can

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,389
kind of feed into that into what you

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,139
make but it has to be a living thing it

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:17,930
can't be a binder that sits on the shelf

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:20,000
so inside that box I divide it up into 4

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,519
separate things you need branding

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,139
information you need to have a design

00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,300
language that shows visuals and

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,480
interactive or interaction design

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,949
choices editorial guidance on voice and

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,329
tone telling your writers when to be

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,850
friendly and when to use formal language

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:36,829
and a code library for developers to

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,870
implement now you'll start to notice

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:41,240
that there's a Venn diagram with the

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,490
rest of the team so as designers and

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,959
marketers you know we dip our toes into

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,600
code and we dip our toes into writing

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,250
and so a style guide a design framework

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,860
like this really solves all of these

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,250
needs co-head cohesively so you're part

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,899
of a team so a lot of my talk talking

00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,089
about style guides stuff there is

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,709
overlap and that's on purpose because

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,970
that overlap helps you think

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:06,290
holistically on what is going on so

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,540
let's let's talk a little bit about this

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,949
let's talk about branding so branding

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,199
information is used to set guidelines

00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:13,790
for how your company or institutions

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,010
core assets are used

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,410
this can include colors fonts logos

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,269
typography and more it's the core of

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,310
your essence it's you know it's the

00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:26,360
green track jacket that you wear because

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,649
you're a web chef at 4 kitchens so I

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,970
mentioned that I worked at the

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:31,550
University of Pittsburgh so I'm going to

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,610
pull from my past life at Pitt some

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,079
examples here you can see here

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,880
the University of Pittsburgh is using

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,200
their style guide to help tell the story

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,029
of the university itself

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,649
I know that that's too small for you

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,089
guys to read but basically it's it's

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,579
starting to talk about the history of

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:48,010
the logo itself and the next several

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,540
pages actually talk about how this mark

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,470
is the latest incarnation from the

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,660
original identity that was done in 1787

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,940
I don't know about you but doing logo

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,750
revisions on a logo that long that was

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,740
pretty much pretty awesome so another

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,420
thing that the University of Pittsburgh

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,890
does is that it makes sure that its

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,200
language about what it's talking about

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,120
is consistent so here we've got the

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,060
University of Pittsburgh seal broken

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,000
into a variety of parts the labels are

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,700
small and I apologize for that but the

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,760
breakdown shows the the name circle the

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,130
leaf sprigs the Latin banner and the

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,480
shield and crest this breakdown helps

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,220
ensure that everyone working on Pitt

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,769
projects is talking about the same thing

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,750
by defining a shared language so they've

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,190
actually broken up this complicated logo

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,740
and made sure that whenever people talk

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,170
about it you know like oh can I use the

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,810
sprigs as a design element

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:44,860
everybody knows well everyone who's seen

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,390
this knows what I'm talking about so in

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,410
addition to that there's the the

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:52,449
universal like logo with a dotted border

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,430
around it and arrows that goes into

00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:56,640
every branding style guide just to show

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,040
how much space to go around the logo

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,709
here this particular page also sneaks in

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,690
and it's not going to be illegible it's

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,730
in its the text that's in the blue it

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,920
actually defines its fonts here as well

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,589
so it says use Janssen for the

00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,120
University of Pittsburgh text and then

00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:17,440
it says use Helvetica for everything

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,230
else let's see the University of

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,829
Pittsburgh also breaks down their color

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,209
identity unfortunately they are very

00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,640
print centric in their particular

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:30,459
branding guideline and so they they

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,579
literally scanned the Pantone chips to

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,930
put into the style guide so I thought

00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,910
that was charming and so I thought that

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,920
would share that with all of you guys so

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,770
so yes so they've they've clearly

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,910
defined what their colors are and I had

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,790
to do a little bit of digging in the

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,420
document and I actually managed to find

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,060
that they actually do have

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,010
sedessa mole colors in the text which

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,570
they've omitted the hash before them so

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,670
I'm going to be writing a sternly

00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:00,710
written letter to my friends who work

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:02,030
there so yeah so that's branding let's

00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:06,050
let's talk a little bit about design

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:08,450
language okay so your design language

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,220
says a lot about who you are it conveys

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,650
a message of importance or friendliness

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,240
to the people who interact with you it

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,510
helps build a rapport that keeps them

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,950
engaged with you so defining design

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,580
language includes things like your

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,280
design principles your aesthetics your

00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,570
UX principles and how to use motion and

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,240
so on and so forth anything that's

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,190
relevant to helping a designer do their

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,670
job is something that should go into the

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,320
style guide and so I'm going to start by

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,880
I'm going to be showing you guys a

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,790
series of style guides that are out

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,080
there if you go to style guides dot IO

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,150
there are a wealth of them out there

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,520
many of them do a lot of things right

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,560
some of them not so right but it's worth

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,930
seeing all of them so the Lightning

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,500
design system this is by Salesforce and

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,090
this is I think a really nice one their

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,470
style guide is explicitly built to

00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,980
empower a large number of people to

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,930
build on their system so so whereas

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,520
maybe maybe some of the projects that

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,990
you're going to be working on are

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,180
working on your own and your own style

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,800
guide for your own team so maybe like

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,050
you're talking like 20 people or fewer

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,700
might touch it this lightning design

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,200
system is built for thousands of people

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,240
potentially tens of thousands of people

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:25,040
because they Salesforce offers up large

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,710
code base so that people can build apps

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,450
and so they have done their due

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,800
diligence to define stuff so it's really

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,610
worth going through because everything

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,160
is very clear they have articulated a

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,520
set of design principles so they

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,440
prioritize clarity efficiency

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,640
consistency and beauty and you can

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,400
expect that everything in the style

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,230
guide is based on this bedrock so these

00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,430
values I mean these are great values who

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,170
doesn't like efficiency efficiency

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,010
through laziness is one of my personal

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:57,500
mottos but you have to determine like

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,050
what are your kind of like guiding

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,450
design principles and when you list

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,089
then it really helps to orient for

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,569
whenever you're creating new things and

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,800
they even they leave no stone unturned

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,170
that they have animation style

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,730
guidelines so they tell you how to you

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,069
know their recommendations on timing and

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,079
effects and dimension to make sure that

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:21,290
the entirety of the suite feels

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,170
consistent so like ease in not ease out

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,230
or whatever the case might be so that

00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,170
things are animated consistently the

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,480
Warner Brothers would be very proud they

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,650
even go so far as to provide you with a

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,380
loading widget

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,510
okay this is a lovingly crafted loading

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,450
spinner think about that for a moment a

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,800
lovingly crafted loading spinner I don't

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,309
think I would I never thought I'd say

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,170
that out loud and not only they do they

00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,880
define this for you but they actually

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,320
show you an example of this loading

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,290
spinner in all the different places

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,860
where your application will fail cards

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:59,809
and lists and full screens and so you

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,929
you're not going to be caught on unaware

00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:07,460
of what is going to show up when so

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,640
pardon me so in addition to this

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,660
Salesforce realizes that the people that

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,300
they're working with the people who are

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,760
using this particular design system have

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,290
a variety of skill sets I'm sure that a

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,080
lot of you are very familiar with like

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,700
code oriented design systems and and

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,830
every design system that I'm sharing

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,610
with you today has code snippets that go

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,740
along with it

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,890
but as a designer maybe you don't maybe

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,809
like HTML CSS you really don't want to

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,130
deal with the code quite as much you

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,840
want to kind of like let someone more

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,780
skilled deal with that and you deal with

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,929
the interaction design and you deal with

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,169
the color selection and the the visual

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:47,210
effects and the UX of it

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:49,760
Salesforce offers sketch files

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,620
everything that's built in their library

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,830
they've got a sketch file for which

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,750
means that if you need to build a

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,400
Salesforce application you can hire a

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,650
designer send them these sketch files

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,540
they can put together a UI for you using

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,280
those components and then you can use

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,410
the components that are in the a

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,120
developer can use the components that

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,970
are in the component library to build

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,290
that out and so what you have is every

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,730
time a component is added to this

00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,110
library is at

00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,650
everywhere where it will be useful for

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:21,590
the rest of the team and then there's

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,620
also a just to show that other Design

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:27,020
Systems offer it IBM's carbon design

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,900
system actually offers sketch files as

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:34,100
well so everything that gets created has

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:37,640
a code version and a common for everyone

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,380
on the team to work with so the next

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,560
thing that I'd like to talk about is to

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,540
talk about voice and tone this is a part

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,510
of a style guide that has a tendency to

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,330
get overlooked it's kind of it's one of

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,620
those nice to haves and I mention it so

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,070
that we can all collectively do a better

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:58,220
job making sure that it's included voice

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,690
is the core of your personality and tone

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,970
is doing what you're saying and how best

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,650
to say it so this is something that your

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,000
editors and writers are going to need to

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,580
know and and even the people who are

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,920
developing interfaces like you know do

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,500
you say do you use the term apply or

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,210
save on a dialogue button whenever

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,830
you're done like these are things that

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,920
should be consistent and should be

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:21,440
codified so the gold standard for voice

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,360
and tone comes from MailChimp the

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,490
personality of their app is a vital part

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,740
of their branding so they've codified it

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:32,320
in a document that they call voice and

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:34,700
tone so let's go through some examples

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,470
here you can see an example of a success

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,990
message at the top they give the author

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,000
context for how a person is feeling this

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,010
user is feeling relief and pride and joy

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,930
and so the suggestion to the author is

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,970
to Pat them on the back use casual

00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:51,170
language and tell them to feel free to

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,310
be funny it's all good but then here

00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,990
we've got a different story

00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,740
as you can tell from the angry red color

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:59,240
something has gone dreadfully wrong the

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,190
person who the author needs to speak to

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,520
is feeling confused and stressed and

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,740
maybe even angry so the suggestion here

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,380
is to offer a solution or a next step

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:13,580
while being straight forward remain calm

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:16,370
and be serious so they give you guidance

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,490
on how to handle when things go wrong as

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:21,680
well as when things go right

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:25,070
so the carbon design system another

00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,420
design system by IBM is pretty awesome

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,410
and it handles voice and tone a little

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,780
bit differently

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:34,490
but no less clearly than what MailChimp

00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:36,590
did so inside of the carbon style guide

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,850
when you visit the content section you

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,650
can read all about voice and tone and

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,710
what they mean to the company so they

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:45,470
they tell you why it's important and

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:49,850
then where MailChimp provided guidance

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:52,220
and way of situations Carbon lists out

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:56,570
writing principles has a backbone for

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:59,330
communication so do use active voice do

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,960
use second person and they tell the

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:05,480
reader why they should use those those

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,820
why they should use that and when so

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,370
they even go as far as to provide a

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,780
glossary of commonly used terms this

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,280
ensures that everyone means the same

00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:18,020
thing when they talk about things and it

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,970
reduces confusion so let's move on let's

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,290
talk about code a little bit I know that

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,030
I've been talking about designers and

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,320
developers but a good style guide

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:28,850
includes a code section and so style

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,790
guides are wonderful things as long as

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,870
you can implement them so most of what

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,900
we're gonna have here are going to be

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,760
code snippets for using components but

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,620
this section also can contain

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,590
development principles how-to

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:46,610
architecture new components and divine

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:48,110
define a review process so we're going

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,880
to go back to the carbon design system

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,770
for a moment and we're going to look at

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,720
a single date picker this is a prime

00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,790
example of a component in a code library

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,830
it has the component displayed on the

00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,090
page to interact with and it has the

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,210
code that you need to implement it right

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:04,610
on the page we're gonna see the same

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,680
thing in the Yelp style guide so in the

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,540
Yelp style guide they also have their

00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,820
components listed on a page you can

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,360
interact with them and they include code

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:17,000
snippets here's the thing we're facing a

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,590
decoupled future and their devices out

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,720
there that require a different code to

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,060
run okay so all of the examples that

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,920
you've seen so far HTML CSS some

00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,930
JavaScript you know the Holy Trinity

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,940
it's all great but there are devices

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,340
that don't actually run that so you've

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,330
got Android devices and iOS devices and

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,800
like you know Roku's and you know I we

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:41,120
all know we've got a long long laundry

00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,220
list of things and so your style guide

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,900
whenever you have these new arenas that

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,270
you go into should be expanded to go

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,480
into these arenas so for instance the

00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,600
the Salesforce lightning style guide it

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,160
includes Android code snippets

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,630
everything that they've built for their

00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,800
website they've also built for Android

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,320
so you need to build an Android app for

00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,120
them boom you've got it right here they

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,790
add a new component gets added to this

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,350
it's fantastic it's great and they even

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,210
make sure that I ask people aren't left

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,960
out in the dust because you know we get

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,510
everything last right no but I tell you

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,980
what I was really surprised by this next

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:20,870
thing Salesforce serves Window Phone all

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,290
right does anyone here have a window

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:27,860
phone all right good

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:30,050
but yes but yes they they have people

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,030
who apparently it's enough to justify

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,400
them maintaining it for it and they know

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,500
their user base and so like they provide

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,940
code snippets for Window Phone it's

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,309
wonderful so let's talk about how to

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,790
keep a style guide updated a little bit

00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:47,990
so because progress stops for no one you

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,179
need to have a plan for adding new

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,130
features or removing old features this

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,580
is a living document things grow and

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:59,000
change and shift and molt as time goes

00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:02,600
on and so you need to have that baked

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,280
into your style guide I swear I'm not

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,870
trying to push Salesforce on you guys

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,280
but they just have a really nice style

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,520
guide that has a lot of the features

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:13,100
that I like and so like here you can see

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,610
circled is it says prototype in progress

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:19,100
for this app launcher feature what this

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,220
means is is that you can use it now it's

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,510
available to you but you can actually

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,600
you know that it's going to shift on you

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,160
or you know that feedback you provide to

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,720
them would be incredibly valuable I

00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,880
prefer to look at it that way

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,030
as somebody who makes components if it's

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,190
broken tell me please please and so

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,780
you're able to to see these sorts of

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,370
things so you can have a status marker

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,100
like in addition to in progress you can

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:47,150
have you know soon to be deprecated or

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:50,520
going away or unused you know and just

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:53,250
track your various components

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,720
so now I want to take a moment and ask

00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,710
everyone to stop making style guide a

00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,990
four-letter word

00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:02,670
okay this is something perhaps it's the

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,050
fact that like I've got 20 years under

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,750
my belt in the industry or something

00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,400
like that but most of my experience with

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,590
the term style guide except for like the

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,290
last two or three it has been synonymous

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,179
kind of with failure and the reason for

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,950
that is that a style guide was a binder

00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,380
that sat on a shelf with a layer of dust

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:22,580
on it there was only brought out to

00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,420
resolve arguments in meetings okay

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,250
judging from the laughter I think

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,380
everybody has some similar experiences

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,820
but there are two problems with style

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,780
guides that we have to overcome to make

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,490
the use of them

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,679
they're to make the best use of them

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,600
okay and the very first one is going

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,179
stale you don't want to get dust on your

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,450
style guide because it's sitting around

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:44,250
going unused so for a designed to be

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,110
consistent we have to consciously push

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,690
all changes and new additions through

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,340
the style guide so what this means is is

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,630
that when you create a new component it

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,040
goes into the style guide it goes

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,730
through the process and gets fed back

00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,200
out and so that way it's maintained it's

00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,700
consistent and it gets routed through

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,980
that central authority that I mentioned

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,350
earlier to make sure that everything is

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,110
as it should be

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,760
I lost my spot so a style guide has to

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,780
be a living document as best you can

00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,340
you'll want to integrate it directly

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,950
into the sites and apps that you're

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,179
building so for instance at four

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,700
kitchens we've built a tool called

00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,140
emulsify for Drupal it's a front end

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,480
theme that is both a living style guide

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,120
and a template system for Drupal that

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,710
uses that we use to style a site so what

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,660
that means is is that if we change

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,820
something in our style guide it will

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,440
immediately change on the site like so

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,809
if our card component we decide that we

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,450
want to put a big like rainbow border

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:39,809
around it as soon as I as I merge that

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,030
without Evan approving it it immediately

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:45,900
goes live on the site and we've got to

00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:47,910
revert it but so it's really nice that

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,980
your with your style guide as a

00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,679
dependency you can prevent your style

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,929
guide from going stale so the second

00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:59,010
problem with style guides the second of

00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:01,080
two is that a style that sometimes you

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,220
get a strong pushback from designers due

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,440
to an imagined sense of being restrained

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,659
what they can do I'm a designer been as

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,429
designer for 20-plus years

00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:13,179
I don't like style guides I want to do

00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:15,400
that cool thing I want to do so you know

00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:16,809
a lot of designers think that way the

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,190
reality is that a style guide should

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,110
never be a restriction on what's needed

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,090
using a style guide should be like using

00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,950
Legos you can build whatever you want to

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,559
out of Legos if you don't have enough

00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:29,650
Legos go get more Legos just bring it

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,070
together so for instance Lee for

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,690
instance

00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,010
we recently built a project where a

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,860
client was concerned about creating

00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,510
custom areas on key pages like you know

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,789
like a big hero at the top they would do

00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:42,010
like a lot of custom like images and

00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,380
interactions and things and we were

00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:46,059
talking to them about emulsify and like

00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,289
you know like okay so we've got all of

00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,240
these consistent stuff and they're like

00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:51,610
well we've got these bespoke one-off

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,690
things that we make like we don't want

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,480
to be you know we don't want to be

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,799
restrained by the style guide so we told

00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,020
them that the style guide was there to

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,210
serve them so we actually explicitly

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,100
added a custom call to action widget in

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:07,150
the style guide that was intentionally

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:09,970
left blank it was just called like don't

00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,980
you remember like custom widget and it

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,510
was literally just a blank slate that we

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,900
added documentation that's like you know

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,730
put your bespoke snowflake here and so

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,740
they were they were very satisfied that

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,179
by that and it's just an example of how

00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,799
a style guide is supposed to work for

00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:26,110
you not against you if it's working

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,100
against you you have a bad style guide

00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:32,770
it should work with you so we're getting

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,020
closer to the end so how do you make a

00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,510
style guide how do you create and

00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,309
maintain a system like this okay not

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,289
everybody is starting a project fresh

00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:43,570
from the ground up everybody has history

00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:44,890
and legacy you know I mentioned the

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:48,190
University of Pittsburgh you know I

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:50,409
worked there you know I started in 2000

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,690
and like at that point they added like

00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:55,179
200 years of history you know I wasn't

00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,169
starting from scratch the first thing

00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:58,120
that you have to do is you have to audit

00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,620
your assets okay so you've got to go

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:04,120
through your properties all the websites

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,559
apps whatever what-have-you and list all

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,929
of the widgets and components that you

00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:10,419
have now it is not uncommon to find

00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:12,880
dozens or more of button Styles a

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:13,630
rainbow of color choices and more fonts

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,340
than you can state

00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,559
shake a stick at whenever you go through

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,879
this process

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,950
what you want to do is you want to log

00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:22,470
it all and then you go through them and

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,549
you categorize them when you're done

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,840
you'll have a sense of what kind of

00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:28,409
widgets and components you'll actually

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,830
need the next thing that you need to do

00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:33,120
is find your voice you want to define

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,730
how you speak with the people who you

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,090
engage with so are you formal are you

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,889
informal are you a little bit of both

00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,720
you know I want my bank to be formal

00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:46,799
they handle my money I don't want them

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,450
cracking jokes but what about a

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,009
university so at the University of

00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,379
Pittsburgh our voice was mostly formal

00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:54,749
in fact our voice was Chicago Manual of

00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:59,610
style 14th edition with a smattering of

00:30:54,749 --> 00:31:02,129
AP and but yeah but for some of our

00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,529
touch points we we kind of softened it a

00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:06,299
little bit because for stuff like

00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,799
admissions we want to get the best

00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,179
student we wanted to get the best

00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,769
students in I'm sure they still do I

00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,360
don't work there they want to get the

00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:14,100
best students in so we adopted a more

00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,710
informal conversational tone because we

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,480
wanted to to better adopt you know

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,220
language that would be attractive to

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,169
them and that's something that should go

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,429
into a style guide so that again it's

00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:25,860
consistent and it's not unexpected

00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,480
whenever you're you know your flyer or

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,210
your email campaign that's going to

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,509
admission students cracks jokes whereas

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:35,129
maybe like you know your university like

00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:38,610
bylaws page you don't want to have jokes

00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:40,049
on it so you also have to define your

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,730
brand standards you're probably already

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:42,779
going to have this already that's

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,789
something that a lot of companies

00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:47,309
whenever they get identity work done

00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:50,399
they have brand standards so this is

00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:52,169
stuff like corporate colors typography

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,090
etc but one of the things that you have

00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:55,529
to consider is are your corporate colors

00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,990
the only colors that can be used on a

00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:01,350
project do you have accent colors do you

00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:03,360
have or is it okay to use any color as

00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,669
long as your logos and the appropriate

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,809
colors how does your logo work on a

00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:09,990
variety of different types of

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:11,820
backgrounds some some branding

00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,460
guidelines that you'll get will solve

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,749
these some of them won't I was looking

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,369
through the University of Pittsburgh one

00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:19,379
in preparation for this talk and they

00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:22,289
have like six pages of what not to do

00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:24,779
with the logo like just like big red X's

00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:27,629
over all sorts of crazy stuff I don't

00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:31,230
know who did the fisheye tie dye version

00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:33,210
of it but but that was pretty crazy

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,340
so then lastly you're gonna need to

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,809
build and document your toolkit so all

00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,299
of the examples that I show you live

00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:40,769
publicly on the web yours does not have

00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,330
to live publicly on the web but it does

00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:44,070
have to live somewhere that's accessible

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,190
to the people who are working on it and

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:49,590
so you need to create these assets each

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,419
team has different needs like marketing

00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,210
needs to know how to use and implement

00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:56,039
widgets and editors need to know the

00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,389
tone of how to talk with users whenever

00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,490
they write an email campaign and

00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:01,080
developers need code snippets to ensure

00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,139
that interactive elements are working

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,120
appropriately and so like you need to

00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:08,399
actually bring all of this together and

00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,679
document it and make it work and when

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,289
questions arise when someone says you

00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,610
know that accordion widget was a little

00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:19,230
bit confusing you have to revise it so

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:21,419
let's talk about how to communicate this

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,279
so this information has got it has to be

00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,370
communicated back to the rest of the

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,529
team and there are a lot of apps and

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,389
services that facilitate this in fact

00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:32,190
we're entering a golden age of design

00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:34,019
tools that bridge the gap between team

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,789
members between developers and editors

00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,990
and marketers and designers and my

00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:38,970
four-year-old daughter is making

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,880
PowerPoint presentations who knew it's

00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:43,860
crazy you know there's a growing number

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,820
of apps and services to help you I'm

00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,710
going to go through a an admittedly

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,059
incomplete list of tools that can help

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,559
you on your journey

00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,149
but I just wanted to leave you with like

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,740
some ideas with some of the some of the

00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:59,370
tools that are out there that can kind

00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,830
of help you as part of this process so

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,029
the first I dare say that whenever it

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:07,230
comes to doing interactive and visual

00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:09,089
design that sketches the go-to tool you

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,149
know it has a robust plug-in ecosystem

00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:13,950
which is not unlike Drupal modules that

00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:15,329
give designers superpowers like you can

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:18,000
make flexible layouts you can publish

00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:21,030
websites with sketch if you get the

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,970
right plug-in it's pretty crazy

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:28,139
some are free some are paid but it is a

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:29,429
an awesome and extensible tool the next

00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,190
one that I want to tell you about is

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:34,589
Zeppelin so Zeppelin is a wonderful

00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,510
complement to sketch you can create

00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:39,929
style guides and resources for the whole

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:41,940
team to use in Zeppelin so a designer

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:43,410
will upload their sketch files they'll

00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,720
go in and select various

00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:47,400
they will give those colors names that

00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,160
turn into variables that then can be

00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,230
used by your iOS team your Android team

00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,140
your web development team they can pull

00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,630
those specific RGB color values or

00:34:55,140 --> 00:35:00,420
rather those variables that are defined

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,920
in the style guide and if you as a

00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,170
designer decide that you know what that

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,600
sheet of blue wasn't right I need to

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,060
change it you upload a new file you

00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:12,060
changed the definition for that blue

00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,060
variable that you have and when the when

00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:18,120
the developers pull it it will change

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:22,050
and it will be updated okay

00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:23,700
Zeppelin also allows you to like you can

00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,130
export like various code things like you

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:30,030
can get like sizes and font sizes and

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:32,160
things like that and you can export for

00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,840
ios and android mention that and in

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,150
addition to working with sketch it also

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,160
works with Photoshop and Adobe XD so if

00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,320
you're still using Photoshop and Adobe

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,620
like products you're not left in the

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,710
dust

00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,420
Zeppelin has full support for that too

00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:47,850
which leads me into Photoshop and Adobe

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,640
XD these are both very good tools I've

00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:53,820
used Photoshop the most for web design

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,640
in my career are you sketch now but like

00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:00,090
if I looked at hours logged Photoshop is

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,520
my baby and Adobe XD is new on the

00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,790
market it is basically a sketch clone

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,050
but is a very good sketch clown so if

00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,550
you're kind of on the fence about trying

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,310
it I do recommend that you try it it has

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,730
a lot of good things it also mimics

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:17,940
sketches one downfall which is

00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:20,730
moderately bad typography support so

00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,390
like so you can't win for using either

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,700
of those but it's not a perfect world

00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,160
there's also a tool coming out soon

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,710
envision studio so you may have heard of

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,960
envision primarily used for like

00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:36,630
reviewing comps so on and so forth you

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,850
can actually this will be a free tool

00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,970
that you can visually build out

00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:45,360
responsive designs and share the code I

00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:47,700
literally just got my beta access to

00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,830
this yesterday as I was traveling here

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:55,420
so I haven't cracked it open yet but I

00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:57,040
can't wait then just a couple more and

00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:01,660
I'm gonna I think I've got time for

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,210
questions avec owed if you're invested

00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,069
in the Adobe ecosystem and you don't

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,420
want to buy an Adobe license for all of

00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:10,540
your developers just so that they can

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,880
extract ass assets avec owed is the way

00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:15,609
to go it's an application it can open up

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,460
Photoshop files what is it Photoshop

00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:21,160
sketch Adobe XD and figma it can open up

00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,329
all of these and you can pull assets

00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,710
just like all the things that I

00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:24,609
mentioned with Zeppelin you can also do

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,170
with avec Oh

00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:29,109
so you have options out there based on

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:30,099
what works for you and your team and the

00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,770
last thing that I want to mention

00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:37,839
because this is so weird and so cool is

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:41,079
so Airbnb so much they love their style

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,970
guides so much that they actually have

00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:44,829
coupled it they've coupled their visual

00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,799
assets with the codebase they're

00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:51,640
generating sketch files from their react

00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:55,059
components so Airbnb is actually coding

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,430
it up and then creating sketch files

00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:59,619
from that so I can only imagine that

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,170
like their loop is like designer designs

00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:04,809
a thing coder makes it coder creates a

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,630
sketch file that designers use that's a

00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:12,940
pretty awesome feedback loop it blows my

00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:15,220
mind I haven't played with it yet but so

00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,900
ultimately everything's moving so fast

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,760
and every team has different preferences

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,960
on what works for them so the best thing

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,430
that you can do is evaluate the options

00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,130
that appeal to you and choose the one

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,480
that works best for your team you know

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,950
talk to a lot of people find out what

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,040
they're using what they're doing and see

00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:33,099
what works for you so I think I've got

00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:35,470
time for questions I'm not sure when my

00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:36,970
talk ends but I will take questions if

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,400
anyone would like to come up to the

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,990
microphone and ask a question I'd prefer

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,349
it to be about the talk but you can ask

00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,349
me anything

00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,960
No

00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,960
all right great thank you all very much

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,869
[Music]

00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,330
as a reminder there is a survey on the

00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:03,630
DrupalCon site so you can go and give me

00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:05,670
all whatever the thumbs-down is that

00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:08,660
would be great all right thank you all

00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,660
