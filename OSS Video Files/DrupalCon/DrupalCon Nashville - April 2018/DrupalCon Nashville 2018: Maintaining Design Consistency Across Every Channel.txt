Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Maintaining Design Consistency Across Every Channel
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	With the growing shift towards a decoupled future a company’s presence is going to be represented by an ever-expanding collection of websites, apps, and talking speakers. 

Maintaining design and tone consistency across those channels will be challenging but if done right, it can allow you to enter markets more quickly while keeping the style and tone of your company aligned.



In this talk we’ll discuss:

Getting everyone, including leadership, onboard with valuing  strong, centralized design
How to work out what should—and what shouldn’t—go into a style guide
What we can do to make “style guide” stop being a four-letter word
How to create a system that works for your company. (Any size company!)
How to communicate that design to teams that have to implement it—other designers, developers of all stripes, and managers of those teams


Who should attend:

EVERYONE
Business owners and leaders who want to leverage design to grow
Designers and Marketers who want to do great work
Developers who want to share this talk with the rest of their team because this makes dev go faster.
