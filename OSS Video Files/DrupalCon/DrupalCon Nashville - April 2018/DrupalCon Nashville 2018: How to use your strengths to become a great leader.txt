Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: How to use your strengths to become a great leader
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Employees are not just human resources anymore, they are the teams of personalities and they need to be treated this way. Thus, to achieve a team’s success not a manager is needed, but a leader. The difference between a manager and a leader is that the manager tends to put the project’s goals above the personal goals of team members. On the other hand, the leader is the one who seeks to build a strong commitment based on the intersection of the project goals and the personal goals and values of his/her team members.

Teams that truly believe in their goal demonstrate better results and see the big picture of how their today’s actions will affect themselves, their company, and the world in the future. Building this kind of attitude within a team takes strong leadership skills.

There are different leadership styles, and knowing yours will help you benefit from your natural strengths while working on areas of improvement. However, a leadership itself is a complex term, and it should be examined from different perspectives in order to apply it to your life and become a true leader to your team.

I believe that there should be at least 2 steps taken in the process of understanding what kind of a leader you are.



First, we will use the PAEI model of Ichak Adizes in order to classify the leadership styles and make a self-assessment. This model teaches to benefit from amplifying strong sides while leveraging less developed skills. We will discuss the successful patterns of behavior that can be applied to each leadership style.
Second, we will talk about the life values that shape your personality. I believe that before leading the team to some results and goals, true leaders must know where they go themselves. And for that purpose, we will use the Golden Circle model designed by Simon Sinek. This approach will reveal why you do what you do, what stands behind your decisions and how to become an influential leader by reflecting your values to your actions.


During this session we will answer the following questions:

how to become an influential leader
what your strengths are in terms of leading a team
how to amplify your strengths while improving weaknesses


For whom this session is:

project managers that want to achieve extraordinary results together with their teams;
CEOs that want to build a strong team that has a balance in leadership styles;
anyone who wants to take a step and become a team leader.

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,269
really grateful for the Drupal community

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,279
to have a chance actually to stay here a

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,110
music girl from the middle of nowhere

amazing so let's give a huge round of

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:46,110
applause to Drupal community into each

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:49,410
one of us thank you

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,899
I guess it would be fair if I introduced

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,910
myself first before I start with my

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,469
content for you to have an idea why have

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,870
I chosen this topic and actually what

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,090
experience I have about it so my name is

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,219
marina and I come from Russia quite a

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,559
small city somewhere in the middle of

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,240
Siberia and I've worked there in the

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,680
companies as solutions and I'm

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,409
responsible for organizational

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,080
development so during my professional

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,590
experience I've been a team member of

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,750
many teams and I also had an honor to

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,729
lead several of them and through each

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,920
and every of those experiences I somehow

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,080
reinvented myself to find out what kind

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,680
of leader is needed to lead the team to

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,630
great success but nothing is good from

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,299
the first time sometimes so my first

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,659
membership experience was the failure so

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,030
I was like this little puppy in the new

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,960
team I didn't know what to do I didn't

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,290
know how to do it whom to ask so back

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,450
then it was the second or third year of

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,720
university I guess I joined the youth

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,310
international youth NGO which was doing

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,259
international student exchange so I'm

00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,110
the same as other newbies and this team

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,610
were assigned to different students from

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,590
different cities and I was supposed to

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,030
find an internship for them but I didn't

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,860
know how to do this I didn't know how

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,709
the platform of this social for

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,400
internship works so actually the team

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,640
leader of our

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,769
didn't do that much bonding of us so I

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,110
didn't know is it okay to approach

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,540
someone else is it okay to ask for help

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,879
and so I was really confused the time

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,140
but somehow I managed to find an

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,840
internship for this goal and I

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,970
understand I wanted to keep going to

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,489
invest more in my self-development and

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,739
hydrate another team so if this time I

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,989
was a team member of a team of a local

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,450
chapter of international organization so

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,680
next step was to be in a team that led

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,870
to this local chapter of this

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,790
international organization and that was

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,730
completely different experience because

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,489
from the first days of this team the

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,310
leader of it treated us completely

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,079
differently she treated us as unique

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,970
personalities she helped us through all

00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,650
the processes she helped us to get to

00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,340
know which others helped us to trust

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,859
each other

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,200
so we met each week and we talked about

00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,840
every successes and what most

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,650
importantly all the failures we had so

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,299
we shared it openly and if when we

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,730
started this experience our local

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,879
chapter wasn't even recognized by the

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,040
capital local chapters so we weren't

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,069
even on the map of our organization that

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,319
small we were that time but in the year

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,269
where was that dedicated we was so that

00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,519
bonded that we managed to become the

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,919
best local chapter in our country and it

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,720
was when we did it we didn't believe it

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,849
ourselves because we were just you know

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,000
third year students knowing nothing

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,459
about how to deal with this stuff but

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,159
the attitude that the leader brought to

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,440
our team changed everything so she

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,479
helped us understand how we can unleash

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,049
our own potential violence even our

00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,729
common goals and that brought us very

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,379
strong commitment towards the shift

00:03:53,729 --> 00:04:00,540
achieving them and that we did so later

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,310
on when I was moving on with my career I

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,709
started to analyze the previous

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,209
experience I had I started to think what

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,489
was the difference between those two

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,949
different approaches to managing a team

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,819
and I understand understood for myself

00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:17,639
that I called it value-based team

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,659
management works better so if in the

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,580
first team the manager were more of

00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:25,120
delegating tasks and putting the project

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,940
goals above our first

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,180
on goals so ii seem the leader behaved

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,610
differently so she helped us to connect

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,300
our personal goals our personal values

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,699
to the project goals and that bonds a

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,410
test that made us really strong team and

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,979
so we could benefit from our common

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:47,650
strengths together so I was digging

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:50,530
deeper on this value based approach and

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,110
tried many mythologies many techniques

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,990
in my next teams and so on and I

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,580
realized that there are actually two

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,220
main components of becoming a good

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,430
leader and the first one is self

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,919
assessment and development why because I

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,340
do believe that the true leader should

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,919
start from their cells so you should

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,710
know who you are and where you go before

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,530
leading others somewhere it's at least

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,780
honest because if you're leading someone

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,440
somewhere without knowing very going

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,060
yourself so you're all lost you know and

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,410
so that is the first step and then when

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,450
you were done with your self-assessment

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,000
go further to self development because

00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,889
you can actually become some become

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,680
better at some points of leadership of

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:41,340
team management management experience to

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,280
become a better leader for your team so

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,500
when you're done with this it's

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,690
important to be able to transmit your

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,580
values transmit your vision to other

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,220
people and therefore the second

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,930
component is communication so if you are

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,210
able to communicate properly with your

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,550
team members with other people to share

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,180
your values to share your goals to unite

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,680
people by them your leader but if you're

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,840
a great personalities a great

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,370
professional but you're not able to

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,590
communicate with different people you

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,510
can not find right approach to different

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,139
people so it will be very difficult for

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,789
you to create a bonded good team at

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,070
least in my opinion so during this

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,740
presentation we will cover those two

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,410
points with our agenda and we will start

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,270
with Golden Circle model designed by

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,930
Simon syndicate will help us understand

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:36,580
why we want to be leaders then we will

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,870
move on to our no natural features

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,720
natural strengths and we

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,370
with PA IMO leadership styles model that

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,600
will help us understand which leadership

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:48,670
styles exist and what wish of them we

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,740
demonstrate then we will do some self

00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,210
assessment and see how we can

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,690
communicate with representatives of

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,910
different styles right so I have

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,930
introduced myself I have introduced our

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:04,570
agenda so I'd really want to know who we

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,490
have here is it okay for me to ask if we

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,820

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,900
going to do this or what are you going

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,490
to do actually so who is for why whose

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,570
things that why are you doing things is

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,190
the most important uh-huh thank you who

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,580
thinks that how are you going to do

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,730
the most important and who thinks that

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,940
what are going to do is most important

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,550
okay

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,330
thanks thank you for participating in my

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,740
small interactions but I'm sorry to

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:11,140
disappoint you but you're all are wrong

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,030
the main point is that you need to apply

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,710
two main principle to this model to make

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,810
it work and the first principle is

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,810
balance so you need to have all three

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,640
questions yes it is easy as this so you

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,620
need to answer all these three questions

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,140
in order to become an influential

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,610
leaders so if you know why you do things

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,360
but you don't know what are you doing

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,860
you won't be able to channel your

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,150
personal values your personal vision to

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,220
your activities and people won't

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,320
understand what kind of person you are

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,090
and on the other hand if you know what

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,860
you do but you don't know why you still

00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,810
miss this connection and people won't

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,720
understand who you are out of what you

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,310
do and the simon Sinek claims that if

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,380
you have answers to all those three

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,640
questions you will be able to help to

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,070
build this strong connection between

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,360
your personal values and your actions

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,150
and that will help you to surround

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,760
yourself with like-minded people who

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:04,540
will join your because of who you are

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:07,440
because of why you do things and this is

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,150
what he calls influential leadership and

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,060
second principle of this model is order

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,980
so you should always start from white so

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,960
in this terms those who rose hands on

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,580
why we were partially right because this

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,050
is the first touch point with this model

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,790
this is the first question you should

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,850
ask yourself why are you doing this

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:28,840
really so why is it important why is it

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,530
that valuable to you what it brings to

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,380
your life

00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:35,440
so if to finalize you should always have

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,120
the clarity of Y where Y is the set of

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,000
your personal beliefs your personal

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,070
values then you need to move to move on

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,010
and find your discipline of how where

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,890
how are the concrete steps to realize

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:51,160
your Y and finally you need to have

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,850
consistency of what where what are what

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,220
is the some tangible results some

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,200
physical manifestation with fixed

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,740
manifestations of your Y in the real

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,209
world so having answers answered all

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,170
those three questions you will be

00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:11,860
able to reflect yourself to your

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:15,249
activities and build the team who share

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:18,369
common values but unfortunately nowadays

00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:20,019
life is so fast and people don't really

00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:21,939
have time to stop and think about those

00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,879
things and usually if you ask others

00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:27,759
like tell me something about yourself

00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,100
people answer something like I study in

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,290
this university I work in this company I

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,920
do this I have this kind of hobby and

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,740
that's it

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,589
they usually not sharing not share with

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,689
you why this is it's important to them

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,519
why they why have they chosen this job

00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:47,199
why have they chosen this hobby and so

00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:49,689
on but actually the point is that people

00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:54,369
don't buy what you do they buy why you

00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:56,110
do it and bonds in people buy why I will

00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:58,420
build much stronger commitment much

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,970
stronger connection among your team

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:06,399
members so I think this quote is very

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:13,689
true so does anyone knows there why

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:15,730
already actually it's hard at first at

00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:18,519
least answer this question but it's ok

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,199
so if you're struggling I suggest you to

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,540
answer two more questions that will help

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,759
you to find your why to understand what

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,129
your why is and the first question is

00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,009
what would you do if you have unlimited

00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:32,889
amount of money so just imagine money is

00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:34,779
not an issue anymore at all and think

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,999
about the list of things that you would

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,860
do then and once you come up with the

00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,959
list of things that you would do if you

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,629
have unlimited amount of money then at

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,790
the same day or on another day to clear

00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,379
your mind think about the list of things

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,259
that you would do even if you're not

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:52,269
paid for it so what are you that

00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:55,509
passionate about that you would do it no

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:58,329
matter what and then look at those lists

00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:00,970
and think what is similar among all

00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:03,790
those activities what do they have in

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,709
common and then imagine yourself doing

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,769
those things and think about what you

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,629
feel what what value those activities

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,730
bring to your life

00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:14,799
this might be not the direct answer to

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,160
your why but this will be a source of

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:23,330
insights to you to find it

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:26,520
and yeah I find my why the hard way so

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:30,450
as I showed you I was a member of this

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:33,630
NGO I was what was there for four or

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,790
five years so and you cannot be a member

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,950
of NGO without knowing why you're there

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,140
so it's an NGO where you are not paid

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,420
for it that's why if you join it if

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,370
you're it is your conscious choice so if

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,470
you join any NGO you want to contribute

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,190
to its mission and the mission of our

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,840
NGO was to make my country Russia a

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,430
better place and I did want to

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,190
contribute to this mission because I

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,840
want my country to be a better country I

00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,910
want my children to be raised in the

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,480
better world and I really wanted to

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,340
contribute to this mission and therefore

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,160
during those four or five I don't really

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,900
remember years it wasn't a question to

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,780
me why I'm doing this I knew why I'm

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,640
doing this but then since its youth and

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,510
student organization then I finished my

00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,070
University and started working in the

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,780
commercial company and at first it was

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,490
very interesting everything was new

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,100
first half of the year was very

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,250
overwhelming I really loved it but then

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,340
I found myself not knowing why I'm there

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,630
anymore so tasks were like too easy for

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,790
me I didn't feel like I'm really

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,440
bringing some value to this company I

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,680
didn't feel with work in this company

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,890
brings value to myself so I didn't

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,800
really see the point of me being there

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:50,280
anymore but and that was really unusual

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,100
and let's say unnatural to me not

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,810
knowing my why I didn't know how how can

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,390
I not answer this question about myself

00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm the one who was supposed to know

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:03,330
myself right but that was struggling for

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,480
months I was trying to push this out of

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:09,330
myself but it didn't appear anyhow and

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,810
then even without knowing about this

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,820
model of simon Sinek i somehow made up a

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,190
list of things that i'm really as i

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,690
really enjoy doing and i included there

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,720
all the things in my life that really

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,670
brought me happiness and fulfillment and

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,950
coded there is the educational events

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,650
that I creates it when was when I was in

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,970
university the brand of international

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,339
internship that I launched

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,050
was working in this NGO all the sessions

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,000
that I prepared and delivered even my

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,279
weird hobbies such as home gardening

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,449
baking and knitting and stuff like this

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,439
and I was looking at this list and

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:48,360
thinking why why I love doing all those

00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:50,759
things and then simply but not easy one

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,819
statement came to my mind I realized

00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,430
that all those things are united by the

00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:59,490
one process of creation of doing

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,040
something out of nothing of like fixing

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,439
something that isn't working properly

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,139
and I just really realized that yes this

00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:10,439
is it so I remembered myself standing on

00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:14,639
the stage of the event that was the idea

00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:16,680
of my mind in my mind that became the

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,970
actual event that 200 people attended

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,000
and I was standing on the stage and

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:24,480
thinking wow I did something that never

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,490
existed before it's so cool and it

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,370
really brought me fulfillment I got

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:33,470
really motivational out of it and I was

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:36,240
ready to do even more and I know that I

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,449
can create much more value for others if

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,160
I win this inspired state so I really

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:45,589
wanted my everyday job to become

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,329
something like this and I put effort to

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:51,689
change my job description a little to

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:55,769
fit it to make it more to make it fit

00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:57,089
more my why and so as I told you in the

00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:59,129
beginning I'm doing organizational

00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,750
development which literally means that I

00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:03,149
create business processes that haven't

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,380
existed before or I fix business

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:08,220
processes that aren't working properly

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,409
so that's how finding my wife helped me

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,419
in my everyday life and I hope that if

00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:15,120
you will answer this question anytime

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,130
even you will need to answer to decide

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,020
whether to do something or no know when

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,120
your wife will be much easier to you to

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:26,819
understand what it will bring to you and

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:29,940
what can you give back so this about the

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:35,490
this kind of personal values assessment

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:38,220
part and now let's talk about how you

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,740
can channel your vision to your team

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,530
what how to become this leader that can

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,480
really lead the team to the grace

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,450
access what role the leader should play

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,880
and we're moving closer to this PA why

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,950
leadership styles model it is designed

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,950
by dr. adidas

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,650
and he's an amazing scientist he is

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,510
amazing book writer I really enjoyed

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,260
reading his works and watching his

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,000
videos and I want him to introduce to

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,560
you the role of the leader because I'm

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,680
sure after watching the video you will

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:15,780
like him too what is a leader please

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,220
look at my hand they see that the hand

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:22,590
is five different fingers five different

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,590
fingers and we need the five different

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,510
fingers in order to get a hand because

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,330
everything it does something different

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:33,360
than another finger if you had five

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,380
fingers like the pointing finger would

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,510
you have a good hand

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,220
this is the best finger there is now you

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,590
would know that a good hand because you

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,160
will meet things that this finger can do

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,080
that this finger cannot do now in

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,590
another segment that also told you that

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,780
in the Middle East when the fighting is

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,260
up together that's called a hamsa that's

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:59,160
a blessing when the five fingers are

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,020
separate that a curse so if you put it

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,190
in front of somebody's face five fingers

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,060
like this you're actually cursing them

00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:10,430
what is the difference between a

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:15,360
blessing and a curse probably two inches

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:15,840
are we different and together that's a

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,720
blessing

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,020
what are we different and separate

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,980
that's a curse so what is the role of

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:28,800
leadership then look at my hand which

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:32,250
drinking is the most important one this

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,160
one you know why because the thumb is

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,550
what makes is the only thing that works

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,090
with every other finger if you don't

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:44,970
ever thump you don't have a hand as a

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,540
matter of fact if you lost your thumb by

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:53,030
some accident a surgeon will have to

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:56,370
break your healthy finger to make it

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,840
perform like a thumb so that you can

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,340
have a

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,060
you know what the leadership is is a

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:07,710
title of my future book or a chapter in

00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:13,890
my present book being a leader is being

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:27,220
some make us work together make our

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:28,570
differences work as a hand yeah so the

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,520
role of the leader is to act like a

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,190
thumb to make different people to work

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,540
together and this is what we will

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,130
understand and these are all of the

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:41,020
leader at least within this session so

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:45,520
but what it takes to make different

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:47,740
people to work together that means that

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,140
you need to appreciate differences and

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,450
it is very important stuff important

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,760
step of becoming a leader to appreciate

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,260
each other's differences because the

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,890
communication of people with different

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,290
points of view can lead to amazing ideas

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,000
and efficient ways to realize them but

00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:07,000
it only applies to constructive

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,600
conflicts so constructive conflicts are

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,830
things that actually drive organization

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,900
to evolve to change and develop and

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,780
again the quote of doctoral thesis if

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,050
all of people think alike none of them

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,000
will think into heart right so if you're

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,580
agree with everybody all the time you

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,250
don't move forwards you don't go any

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,800
further you don't evolve you just stuck

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,230
in one place actually is it okay so how

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,410
do you pronounce the name of the

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,470
doctoral thesis so I tried to google it

00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,800
and I didn't find it in English at all

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:48,820
so in Russian we say it's hug so it's

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,680
the same okay so because I was really

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:56,050
confused because I didn't I couldn't

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:58,390
Google something why yeah so we were

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:01,380
talking about constructive conflicts so

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,460
that is the source of evolution but

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,260
unfortunately or fortunately I don't

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,870
know destructive conflicts happen as

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,910
well and that is the time when the

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,530
leader should step up and to show the

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,540
team

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:16,080
powerful and resulted if constructive

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,090
conflict can be and that there is the

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,400
only way to make this disagreeing

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,740
process not exhausting and destructive

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,040
is to create the atmosphere of trust and

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,900
respect and when respect is if to

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,760
rephrase of Kant is the recognition of

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,240
the right of the other person to think

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,970
differently and Trust is been 100

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,370
percent sure that each and every time

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,430
other team members do anything to

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,230
contribute to your common goals so to

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,300
sum it up the role of the leader is to

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,340
act like a thumb to make to bring

00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,900
different people to work together in the

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:53,850
atmosphere of trust and respect so what

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,190
are those pai leadership styles are

00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:01,590
again the question has anyone heard

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:03,690
about this model good ok so this is an

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,320
acronym where P stands for producer S

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,930
stands for

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,590
administrator instance for entrepreneur

00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:13,560
in AI for integrator let's see what are

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,240
those styles and more details so the

00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,250
first role of the organization is to

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,470
produce results so you need to produce

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,690
some product or service to offer to your

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,730
customers and as a producer is

00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,630
responsible to this and for this

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:30,750
producer is a very hardworking person

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:34,110
producers are always they always have a

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:36,780
lot of tasks they work from very early

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,390
morning to the midnight every day and

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,730
they really can produce good results

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:43,890
under this pressure but sometimes being

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,950
that's note under words they lack the

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:49,440
big picture they don't see how their

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:52,320
current tasks contribute to the final

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,560
company's goal but on the other hand

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,110
they were very responsible they really

00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,720
accurate they do every task and they try

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,700
to make it by deadline and they tend to

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,490
control everything and sometimes they

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,590
become some kinds of control freaks

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,990
because they don't trust the written

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,430
members some bigger tasks because they

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,910
don't know whether they will do this

00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:18,240
fine but so they delegate some minor

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,100
things and they still check it all so

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,080
there are four the more team members and

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,300
the producers team the more work for the

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,450
press

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:28,120
user because anyway he does something

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:31,180
like this it's because producers don't

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,790
really know how to manage the team

00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,040
producers think that all education Zim

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,620
buildings and personal talks I had the

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,990
distraction from work and that's why the

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,360
team members of the producer don't

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,490
develop themselves they cannot do bigger

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,360
tasks the producer can delegate the

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:52,150
bigger tasks and this endless circle

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,820
goes over and over and producers are

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,940
vicious they know what results they need

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:01,960
to achieve and they won't accept any

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,830
smaller things so that's about the

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,790
producer the next hero is administrator

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:12,180
administrator that minister in role is

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:14,380
about how things are done so

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,530
administrators responsible are

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,500
responsible for things being controlled

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:23,050
organized structured and stuff like this

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,740
and for this purpose administrators have

00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:28,840
strong analytical skills they are great

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,880
at working with data they can analyze it

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,250
they can draw write conclusions and they

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,380
really love doing this they are also

00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,360
very meticulous when they are working

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,890
with numbers they check with the double

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,540
checker they never do any mistakes

00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,610
because they're very accurate at this

00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,800
point they have steady and structured

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,290
approach they do first thing first the

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,170
constant second things second never a

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,900
different order and therefore sometimes

00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:55,030
they put procedures over efficiency so

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,740
even though their team members might

00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,870
come up with some efficient way to do

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,570
something they won't allow to start

00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,030
doing this until the team members will

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:07,150
do instructions and of this process of

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,190
this new process and but sometimes

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,410
market situation is changing very fast

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,990
and the company doesn't really have time

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,750
to write instructions for each and every

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,310
new process and in this terms a slow

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,920
decision making process of the

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:25,810
administrator can be not the good point

00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:27,130
for the company or the company yeah so

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,690
administrator has the slow

00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,210
decision-making process because they

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,280
really are they always need more data so

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,600
when the administrator needs to decide

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,850
something they require more day

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,309
and then even more data and only after

00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:44,000
that they maybe decide or request more

00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:46,700
data so and they bounced him with too

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,620
many rules so after some time team

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,679
members will come up with new ideas and

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,240
suggest them but they will stop soon

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,980
because they will know that right after

00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:01,120
they create something new they will need

00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:01,120
to write instructions for this next

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,360
style

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,309
it's an intrapreneur interpreter enroll

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,559
helps organization to successfully adapt

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:14,900
to change and for this intrapreneurs

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,090
really full of ideas they pop up with

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,700
ideas all the time they probably just

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,860
vile popping up with ideas really they

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,260
have many of them so really innovative

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,929
and they know how to bring some new

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,429
things to organization but the point is

00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:30,950
they don't really filter those ideas

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:33,049
they consider all of their ideas as the

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,059
most brilliant ones and they actually

00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:39,799
expect the team members beyond these

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:41,090
ideas right after they say them but team

00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,220
members don't really do this because

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:46,460
they never know whether it was the final

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:51,530
idea or it will change in next five

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,090
minutes so as interpreters think that

00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,409
their ideas of the most brilliant once

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,030
they don't really listen to others

00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:58,520
because they're really scared that

00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:02,330
someone else will be I will create

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,309
something even better than they did what

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,230
they have strategic insights so they are

00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:08,720
really good at creating strategies a

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:10,520
somehow a little bit foresee the future

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,679
and can distinguish a part unities from

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,990
threats and this is the only style that

00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,970
can handle big risks because

00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,890
enterpreneurs a good at working in very

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,080
unstructured conditions and in certain

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,740
situations they are really fine with

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,140
change in environments and so on but

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,090
they have implementation issues so they

00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,890
like creating strategies and popping up

00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,140
with ideas they don't like implementing

00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,780
them and therefore entrepreneurs should

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,669
remember then sometimes

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,380
mediocre but implement it idea it's

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:43,880
better than the most brilliant one but

00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:46,340
never implemented and the final style we

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,790
have the is the integrator so

00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,700
integrating

00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:54,030
roll creates it helps to create the

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,160
bonded team that makes organization last

00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:59,780
during the long term and work

00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,520
efficiently so for this purpose

00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,990
integrators have strong empathy they

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,850
really good at working with different

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,240
people they are really good at working

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:11,760
with and finding approach to different

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,310
people so effective communications is

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,320
their main feature and those other guys

00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,660
that create atmosphere of trust and

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,820
respect that we were talking about but

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,640
of course there are some buds

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,340
and so the backfire of the integrators

00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,990
empathy is that they're really scared of

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,000
conflicts even of the contract

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,560
constructive months so they are

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,880
constantly searching for compromise and

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,850
it flows up their decision-making

00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,830
process so they need to know each and

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,350
every one's opinion before deciding

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,750
something but sometimes it's really

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:48,150
unlike situation to have everyone to

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:51,210
come to agreement especially if the team

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,760
is very big so they put relationships

00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,320
over efficiency again so they need to

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,840
communicate with all the people and to

00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,690
make everyone comfortable but sometimes

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,330
it's really impossible or if the company

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:08,420
is big and the decision should be made

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:10,950
fast and they can take a stand so but

00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,560
the leader really should take a stand

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,810
should have should make a decision and

00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,980
then act upon it because if the leader

00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:24,720
doesn't take a stand someone was willing

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:27,750
it will be the leader well so we have

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,000
described briefly all those four styles

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,620
let's see how they are correlated with

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,050
each other so maybe it's not that

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,960
visible and in the back but its

00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:39,870
presentation the slides are available or

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,450
the DrupalCon the website the page of my

00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,190
session so there are four dimensions

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,230
with which we can compare those styles

00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,110
which is focus perspective speed and

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,390
approach so focus can be result oriented

00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,370
of process oriented perspective can be

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,890
global or local speed can be slow or

00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:59,340
fast and the proach can be structured or

00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,430
unstructured so I guess it's obvious

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,370
that organization

00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,550
to have all the extents of those

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,380
dimensions in order to develop so for

00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,750
example you need to think globally to

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,000
come up with a viable strategy but you

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,430
need to act locally to implement it and

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,930
you need to produce results but you

00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,110
cannot do it or at least you cannot

00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:28,310
scale it up if you don't have well built

00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:30,770
processes and it's a hardly situation

00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,810
when one person can combine all the

00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:37,430
extents of all those dimensions in

00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:39,440
oneself and therefore to manage the

00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,540
organization efficiently the

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,130
complementary team is needed is there a

00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,010
complementary it seems that will combine

00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:48,620
all those four styles in order to

00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,990
benefit from their common assumes their

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,540
collective strengths but to manage those

00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:56,720
team of different individuals who needs

00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,910
who is needed the leader who is acting

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,350
like a thump and brings all those four

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:05,390
styles to work together and that's why

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:07,880
the appreciation of difference is that

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,230
important only in this case the team

00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,060
will benefit from the collective

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:17,930
strength and all of those styles have

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:22,120
their own strong sides but unfortunately

00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:24,410
all of them don't really matter if

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,080
people cannot communicate with each

00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:29,480
other cannot build a good team so

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,700
therefore I would propose a general

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,430
recommendation to representatives of all

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,710
styles is for producer administrator and

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,560
the entrepreneur to develop empathy

00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,300
because they all need it of course due

00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,570
to different reasons the producer needs

00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:47,030
empathy to work with the team properly

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,260
to delegate properly the administrator

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:54,200
needs to have empathy to push people

00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,960
over the procedures and the interpreter

00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,140
needs empathy to listen to others and as

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,550
what about the integrator I won't say

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,860
the integrator should stop being

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,530
empathetic at all of course not but

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,600
integrator should balance the empathy

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,790
because some yes people's feelings are

00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,190
important no one will argue that but

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,260
some

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,680
in different situations it's not the

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:21,800
most important things and the greater

00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:24,450
should take a stand and act upon it so

00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,620
actually those descriptions of

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,810
leadership styles and those

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,030
recommendations are very brief and there

00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,830
are much more details about each and

00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,480
every styles and the lists of

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,760
recommendations to representatives of

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,320
different styles and also list of

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,780
recommendations to how to communicate

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,390
with different leadership styles so if

00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:45,030
you want to know more about your style

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:48,770
style you will colleagues I've created a

00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:50,730
blog post which has very detailed

00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,410
description of all this because we're

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,230
now we're limited in time and I cannot

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,790
tell you all I want

00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:01,320
unfortunately so you can I will share

00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:03,840
with you living further so have you seen

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,520
some similarities with yourself or your

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,520
colleagues in those leadership styles

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:13,800
but actually for me personally it wasn't

00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,720
easy to understand what style what did

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,270
the ship style I have just after reading

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,250
the descriptions so I complete the

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,710
self-assessment test that is available

00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,360
on the ADIZ assist online Institute I

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,879
will also share with you a link that you

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:31,200
can complete this test and be sure what

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,210
style of leadership you demonstrate so

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,370
once you know what a leadership style

00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,260
you demonstrate you should go further to

00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:40,260
from self-assessment to self development

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,440
and see whether you can develop

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,909
different style other styles for to

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,159
become a better leader to your team

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:50,490
members so I'm an entrepreneur at least

00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:52,350
according to the test and so you can

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,899
imagine how much interpreter likes

00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:57,390
working with documents so but I decided

00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,340
that this is the feature I want to

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,570
develop in myself this is the process I

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,190
need to do because I know that it's

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,400
important even though I don't like it so

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:08,750
I decided to develop in myself this part

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,790
of administrator administration style

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,230
second question can be kind of delegated

00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,390
parts of your work to your team members

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,800
or to other representatives of your

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,710
company

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,410
I also delegated some parts of my

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,930
processes to my team members

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,700
first as for enterpreneur it was very

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,230
hard to keep my mouth shut without

00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,760
telling them all the time how to do

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:34,109
better because I know how to do better

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,150
right but I now I'm glad that I let it

00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:38,760
go that time because I see that they

00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,980
really managing it pretty well and I'm

00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,160
really grateful for them to for taking

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,900
those part of my responsibilities and

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,549
finally look at your other team members

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,369
and see maybe you can build this

00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:57,270
complementary it seemed that I really

00:35:50,369 --> 00:36:00,990
can add value to each other well so we

00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:03,359
have find out why we need to be leaders

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,420
we have described all the leadership

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,640
styles and we drafted a strategy how we

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,099
can develop other leadership styles in

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,809
ourselves so now let's see how to

00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:17,400
communicate with representatives of

00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:20,160
different styles so this table clearly

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,280
shows how different people react to such

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,559
easy simple words as yes and no so for

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,349
example the producer for him for

00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,440
producer yes yes and no is no producer

00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:33,750
is easy but then it's not that easy

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,849
anymore so for administrator yes is yes

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:39,150
but now is maybe which means that if

00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:40,020
administrator says you yes I says you

00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,980
know I'm sorry

00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:46,920
it means give me more data and if you

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,549
give the administrator more data they

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,980
can say maybe or even yes and for

00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:54,960
entrepreneur on the other hand yes it

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,789
may be so if today the interpreter says

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,430
yes tomorrow it might be not even maybe

00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:04,109
it may be no and for integrator yeses

00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,940
maybe now is also maybe because

00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:08,039
integrator does it know what is yes and

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,670
what is no and so the integrator

00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,390
consults with all the other team members

00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,490
so of course there are much more

00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,410
dimensions with which you can compare

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,210
different styles and prepare yourself to

00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,490
communications with representatives of

00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,279
those different styles for example the

00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,859
dimension time focus for producer it is

00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:28,920
immediate so producer focuses on what's

00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:32,089
going on right now what tasks are urgent

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,680
right now so administrator

00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:35,440
administrators looks look in the past

00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,290
too

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,670
data to some researchers to facts and

00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,670
stuff like this

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,530
entrepreneurs live in the future in the

00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,530
future strategist opportunities new

00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:51,640
ideas and stuff like this and

00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:53,890
integrators care about presents so do we

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,710
have a compromise now is everything okay

00:37:53,890 --> 00:38:00,520
now is there any conflicts somewhere and

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,589
so on and many other of them so we won't

00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,690
stop right now on each and every one of

00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:08,020
them but if you will if you know that

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:10,450
your colleague or your boss is for

00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,130
example administrator you just see

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:18,119
what's important for the administrator

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:20,560
and prepare yourself to the talk well

00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,020
then how to build this effective and

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,420
efficient communication so first you

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,000
need to know yourself you need to know

00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,339
why you why are you leader why you want

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,859
to be a leader then you need to find out

00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:36,130
what leadership style you have and then

00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:38,619
embrace all your strengths and all the

00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,960
areas of improvement you have you need

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:44,530
to know actually they know this in order

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,720
to improve it or develop it then you

00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,180
need to know your people talk to them

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,710
ask them why are they in your team why

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,470
it is important to them to be in your

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,040
team and keep in mind keep in mind that

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,960
actually money or experience are not

00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,270
really the final answer the final reason

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,180
of people to do something just try to

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,890
gently understand why your team members

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,660
for example need money form so some

00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,400
people need money to travel some people

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,319
need money to help parents and those are

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,569
two different motivations to be in your

00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:15,160
team and two different approaches that

00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:17,829
leaders should demonstrate two words to

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,420
different people and because as I

00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:22,300
already told you in this value based

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,880
approach the leader should find the way

00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,280
to connect personal goal of the team

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,150
member to the project's goal in order to

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,829
create the stronger commitment then I'd

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,240
also recommend you to test your team

00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:36,099
members and find out what their

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,069
leadership styles are because that will

00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:41,470
help you to delegate more efficient so

00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:43,780
for example I bet after this session you

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,520
won't delegate accounts in tasks to the

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,670
intrapreneur you would want the

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,670
administrator to do your

00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:52,260
and finally planned talks in buildings

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,450
and education for you team members I

00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:58,020
know many companies that provide

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,640
education for team members I know some

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,950
companies that also provide some

00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,690
buildings and maybe it's just me but I

00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,570
know just a few companies that have

00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:09,090
structured and well built

00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:12,180
approach towards personal talks with a

00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,370
team members but I promise you each

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,980
minute spent on communicating via team

00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:20,190
members will pay you back when it's time

00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,710
to get results because if people feel

00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:25,290
that you care about them that you really

00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,750
want them to unleash their potential

00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:29,910
through the project to show them the

00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,040
opportunity that they have they will pay

00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:37,020
you back with commitment with results

00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,570
with her loyalty and team goes through

00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,880
different stages of its development from

00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,370
the starting of the project till the end

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,830
and on different stages of team

00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,140
development different support is needed

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:51,270
from the leader so for example at first

00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,950
stages the team members need a lot of

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,490
education they need a lot of team

00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:59,280
building team bonding and some very you

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,050
know intense periods of projects

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,170
organizations some people might need

00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:06,840
emotional support or again knowledge

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,240
support and stuff like this and if you

00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,550
would be interested in planning this

00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,200
structured approach of these talks and

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,480
buildings and educating your team based

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,310
on the team development stages I would

00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,730
suggest you to Google attack ones stages

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:23,160
of team development and here it's very

00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:26,280
basics of team management where it's

00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:33,480
explained how the team goes from forming

00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:35,880
to the adjoining stage well as I

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,190
promised the self-assessment test was

00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,590
that I was talking about there's a full

00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,660
link is available in the slides that are

00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,790
attached to my session page of the

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,860
DrupalCon website and there is a short

00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:50,970
link as well if you want to do it right

00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:54,870
now it's big dot Lea /p Aoi PA UI test

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:57,000
and the blog post and medium where there

00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,230
are much more detailed description of

00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,600
each and every Styles and

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:04,980
recommendations to all those different

00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:08,400
leadership styles so well this is pretty

00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,290
it that's all I wanted to share with you

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:23,070
today I'm really looking for feedback

00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:25,560
and ready to answer your questions well

00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:27,480
if someone has questions I guess in

00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:39,540
order it to be recorded it should be

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:41,280
asked in the microphone right this sort

00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,700
of testing and defining something you

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,310
apply to every member of your team or

00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,170
organization or just a select group that

00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:52,100
are identified as the leaders of the

00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:56,490
organization thank you for the question

00:42:52,100 --> 00:43:02,880
how I work so in my company in my

00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:05,370
company so I have a team and I usually

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,570
test the new initiatives on them and

00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,870
then if it's successful

00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:12,090
I like replicate success I try at least

00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:16,530
to replicate the success to other teams

00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:21,510
in my in the company so now I started to

00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:25,410
do this so when I delegate some tasks I

00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:27,270
see what the person is really how to say

00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,340
what's the leadership style the person

00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,170
is demonstrating and I see whether it

00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,940
will be good to do the gates tasks to

00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,800
this person and also now I'm just seeing

00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,200
how it's working and it's working pretty

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,020
well so I guess in the future we'll be

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:46,080
able to apply this to more teams in our

00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:50,070
company and actually this py model is

00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:53,340
based on the like basic works of Karl

00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:56,340
Yune which in many models that come from

00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:58,170
this very initial model have this four

00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,240
different leadership style but the

00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:04,260
advantage of this model is that it's

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,450
really let's say understandable so the

00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:09,359
advantage of it is that anyone in your

00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,360
company from the first day intern to CEO

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,970
can understand

00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:25,180
apply it so it's it's really worth

00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:34,720
implementing have answered any other

00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:38,290
questions we have done well in case you

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,800
don't have questions then thank you very

00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,830
much

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,230
I really appreciated this session and

00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:47,680
you come in to hear what I'm gonna say

00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:49,540
and yeah if you have time just to submit

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,520
feedback to my session it will be really

00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,010
valuable to me you can just do it

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:58,280
personally or the page of my session and

00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,760
DrupalCon website so thank you very much

00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,899
