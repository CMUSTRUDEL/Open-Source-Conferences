Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Build banging sites with BPM: Bricks, Paragraphs and Modifiers
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Site builders are on a continual search for finding better ways to do things - how can we build more functional, flexible, consistent, beautiful and easy to use sites. This presentation brings together a set of great tools (Bricks, Paragraphs and Modifiers) which makes this possible.

Drupal site builders are familiar with the Paragraphs module, loved by site builders and editors alike and renown for allowing the creation of component based designs. The Paragraphs ecosystem has developed strongly over the years and is now an essential tool in most site builders toolkits.

We have seen the adoption of the Bricks module which works hand in glove with Paragraphs, bringing the complementary power of Layouts and View Modes to components. Paragraphs can now be arranged in a variety of ways to increase the design options available. Bricks appears to be a module on the rise.

Most recently we have seen the emergence of Modifiers plugins which allow editors to easily alter the look and feel of entities such as Paragraphs and Bricks. Modifiers allow for the application of different backgrounds, typography and other effects, bringing content to life.

There three modules come together to form a powerful team: Bricks, Paragraphs and Modifiers (BPM). Combined they allow for components to be arranged and styled, solving the basic problem of how to produce functional, consistent and presentable pages.

This presentation will provide the following:

Overview of component and layout paradigms in Drupal.
Review of the Drupal concepts underlying Bricks, Paragraphs and Modifiers.
A live example of how they can combine together.
Review of the ecosystem and tips to get up and running.
The presentation would be helpful for a wide range of Drupalers: architects, builders, themers and editors as well.

At the end of the presentation attendees should have the knowhow to go out and build a BPM system for themselves. The tools are out there, they just need to be combined.

Murray Woodman, the speaker, has been a long time fan of Paragraphs and now of Bricks. He has worked closely on the Modifiers project and wants to share the knowledge when it comes to BPM.

g'day everyone how's it going it's 10:45

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,860
so I think it's a good time to start

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,170
thanks a lot for coming along so seeing

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:21,570
building banging websites with bricks

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:24,119
paragraphs and modifiers before I get

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,359
into the presentation I'd like to ask

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,660
you all two questions and the first one

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,300
is of all the time you spend on building

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,610
a website how much of that time is

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,010
actually spent on solving customer needs

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,840
how much time are you spending on

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,050
thinking about what your customer

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,250
requires and actually implementing that

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:48,600
versus the time you spend your spending

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,840
rummaging around in the the plumbing of

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,760
Drupal and this is a question we'll come

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,879
back to to look out later in the

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,340
presentation the second one is once

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,649
you've developed your website how

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,739
responsive is that going to be for

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,170
future needs when you've built that site

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,110
are you just crystallizing a design

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,720
that's been developed at the start or

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,060
have you built something a tool kit that

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,330
is going to serve the needs of the

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,040
editors and the end users of your

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:26,159
website hello and welcome my name is

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,890
Murray Woodman and I'm a director at

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,759
Mort we're a group or agency based in

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,610
Sydney Australia

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,570
I work with this team of merry

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:40,140
developers and we've been working on a

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,930
module called the modifiers module over

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,820
the last year or so and we'll be going

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,490
along and and having a look at that in

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,560
detail later in the presentation but

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,290
we'll also be looking at the paragraphs

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,299
module and the bricks module and we'll

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,030
be able to see how these three modules

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,810
are able to come together to form a nice

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,299
little ecosystem for site building as

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,520
we've been developing the modifiers

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,970
module we really have been thinking of

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,950
those two questions how can we build

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,440
sites more quickly how can we

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,840
builder more effectively consistently

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,050
and be basically be delivering them on

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,780
time and giving editors the flexibility

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,739
they need to build the the sites that

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,940
will serve their their customers needs

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:30,209
I'm going to be considering three

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,550
different kinds of personas in this talk

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,280
the first one of course is the visitors

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,950
to your website the end users they want

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,310
to be consuming attractive information

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,230
rich pages which communicate clearly and

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,690
of course on the other side of that

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,819
equation you have the editors and the

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,390
marketers the people who want to be able

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,700
to author attractive persuasive pages

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,190
for the visitors and in this particular

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,860
case we're really focusing on component

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,970
driven design and how those components

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,500
can be used to build those sites and

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,010
finally we're going to concentrate on

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,019
site builders and I count myself as a

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,590
site builder as I'm sure many of you do

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,239
and what we really want to do here is

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,639
leverage the best that Drupal has to

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:22,260
offer and by that I mean combining

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:25,319
entities view modes layouts and multiply

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,870
it multiple modifiers and bringing them

00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:33,120
together in a coherent system so that we

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,799
can serve the needs of editors before we

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,350
go in and have a look at these three

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,690
modules working in unison I'd like to

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,209
sort of take a little sort of walk

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,180
through Drupal history and the different

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,340
ways that we sort of build websites and

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,680
different paradigms we have when it

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,760
comes to layouts and placement of items

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,190
on the page the first one is your

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,040
typical theme where we have theme

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,959
regions and these regions are baked into

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,690
the theme and basically you know the

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,880
design is done by placing blocks on the

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,609
page with visibility rules this is

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,410
probably the way we all started building

00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,510
Drupal websites

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,840
it's the probably the simplest and the

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,669
most effective way of doing things the

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,039
one downside of it though is that these

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,370
layouts are baked in at the start and

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,430
it's very difficult

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,419
to change those if the needs of the site

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,910
changes there is a particular theme that

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:34,570
I've got a soft spot for and it's the

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,970
omega-3 theme back in Drupal 7 days I'm

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,360
sure you know quite a many of us you

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,760
know feel similarly about it this this

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,210
thing came about when responsive design

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,400
was first becoming popular and it was

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,000
able to sort of combine grids and

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,650
responsive in quite an effective way but

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,229
one of the very interesting things about

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,750
this theme was that it had the concept

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:02,620
of zones and these zones were able to

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:06,610
build out different sort of layers of of

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,410
grids effectively and this sort of

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,840
brought a lot of flexibility to the site

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,250
builder no longer where you just

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,260
constrained to having these fixed

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,160
regions Amiga 3 was really trying to

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:20,979
help you chunk the page out and this

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,110
approach we can see that appearing now

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,810
in with the layout builder and we can

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,400
also see in the the bricks module as

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,190
well so it's interesting to see that

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,770
concept you know it was sort of formal

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,280
formulated a while back and now it's

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,990
becoming more popular of course we had

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,930
you know the paralyzer and layout

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,599
plugins you know around this time as

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,660
well and you know panelizer

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,430
and the layout plugins were amazing you

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,669
know they allowed us to have a wide

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,800
variety of layouts that we can swap in

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,479
and out and it really gave the site

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,270
builder and theme you know a lot of

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:02,199
options at their fingertips we had all

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,000
kinds of you know different designs with

00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,680
all these amazing sort of bricks layouts

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,139
and you know there was really a lot of

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,199
options there but once again these

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,570
layouts were fixed at design time you

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,729
could swap them in and out but you know

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:20,889
you were not able to change them as the

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:23,770
as the the site required a few years ago

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:27,340
the paragraphs module really started to

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:30,760
come to the fore you know it's been a

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,810
massive influence on site builders on

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,870
Shore it's you know

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,860
of your toolkits and you know it's an

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,970
incredibly popular module these days

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,180
paragraphs of course not concerned with

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,100
layouts it was concerned with you know

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,770
defining components and encapsulating

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:52,030
those components so that they could be

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:54,100
serve the needs of editors there was a

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,310
whole bunch of there was a massive sort

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,169
of sort of community that grew up around

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,480
paragraphs and you know what's the

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:05,050
different techniques were experimented

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,400
with one of them I call edgy paragraphs

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,530
but these are these basically these edge

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,380
to edge designs that you could get with

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,680
paragraphs basically you could remove

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:17,050
the container from the paragraph and pop

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,090
it out to the edge and that way you know

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,950
the the paragraph is taking the full

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,080
width of the page and of course this

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,180
opened up a whole lot of you know design

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,490
possibilities because theme is could now

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:32,290
target and get those really sort of nice

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:34,360
sort of rich pages that we expect the

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,270
classy paragraphs module also came out a

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,490
few years ago and this really augmented

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,039
that sort of edgy design you know you're

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,770
able to editors were able to put a clasp

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,750
onto an individual paragraph and change

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,660
the way it looked you could change the

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,910
colors of typography the padding the

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,160
look and feel really anything you liked

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,430
and it was that one single class being

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,360
wired into the paragraph that made that

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:04,360
possible so in this this little present

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,380
you know example here oh my goodness

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,889
that is just a terrible contrast oh I'm

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:16,120
gonna I'm sorry about that but yeah in

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,950
the width with these with Class C

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,020
paragraph able to put a class on the the

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,060
div and basically affect the way it

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,970
looked

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,950
the this is really bumming me out about

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,690
the contrast there it's a little bit

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:33,640
bright with it with the bricks module

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,130
what you have now is the and we will see

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,180
this in more detail in better con

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,940
later you have the ability to combine

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:45,360
layouts and entities onto one page and

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,240
basically bring these designs to the

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,420
fore these layer cake designs going down

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,700
so we're able to combine the components

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,980
that we love with paragraphs with the

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,960
layouts and the bricks module is able to

00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,760
bring all of those together and we'll be

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,690
seeing how that works

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,900
later in the presentation and finally we

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:11,190
have the modifiers module which

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:14,040
basically allows presentation look and

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,770
feel to be mapped down into an

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,570
individual entity so we're able to use

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,690
the paragraphs module to provide the

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,940
components and the modifiers module can

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,550
come in and basically change different

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,560
presentational aspects of that so for

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,290
example you could have background images

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,920
background videos different JavaScript

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,530
effects different CSS effects so it's

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,940
basically a way of injecting the

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,360
richness of the Drupal theming layer

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:48,330
onto an entity in a way that's easy for

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:50,000
editors to access okay so let's let's go

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,790
through and have a look at each of these

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,660
components in order firstly the

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,820
paragraphs module you know the success

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,070
of the paragraphs module really comes

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,740
down to its flexibility and just taking

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,430
this quote from the project page it says

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,900
so what's it going to be think big and

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,120
the paragraphs module has opened up a

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,270
whole new world for site builders being

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,730
able to design components - you know for

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:22,440
editors to be able to use and really

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:24,420
that is that the success of it but the

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,820
other important thing about paragraphs

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,480
is that they're scopes to the node that

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:33,030
they're on when an editor is going in

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,440
and editing a particular node they have

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,840
the paragraphs there and they're

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,290
operating within the context of that

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,460
piece of content on the other hand other

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,550
systems such as the layout builder

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,920
and panels IPE they're really sort of

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,649
looking using blocks custom blocks in it

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,620
with a which have a global scope so if

00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:56,020
you imagine a whole stack of custom

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,210
blocks there at living in your sort of

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,730
blocks library there and you may have

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,680
hundreds of these on a website it's

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,500
actually quite difficult for an editor

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,050
to understand what all the blocks are

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,260
have to retrieve them and find them and

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,149
place them on the page you know about a

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,220
year ago we went down the path of

00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:17,860
switching over to IPA and trying to get

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,020
that to work in Drupal 8 but you know

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,760
frankly the the editor experience was

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,399
not so good because it's just hard to

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,500
manage that many blocks and so we've

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,080
switched back to two paragraphs now as a

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,899
way for you know editing and maintaining

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,000
the content on a page so that's why I

00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,459
think you know paragraphs are a natural

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,230
fit definitely for for managing your

00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:43,600
components this is an example and

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,970
thankfully you can almost see that this

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,000
is an example of a page with some

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:52,529
paragraphs on it okay so we've got some

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,500
tabs there we've got some you know

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:58,570
circle progress sort of indicators we've

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,610
got a little gallery and we've also got

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,640
a high charts graph okay so that this is

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,880
demonstrating the componentized nature

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,709
of paragraphs we are using kind of like

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,550
a traditional sort of layout paradigm

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:14,110
here in this case it says panelizer with

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,730
with a sidebar and we've had to do a

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,980
little bit of a hack by just saying hey

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,020
here are some sidebar paragraphs please

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,640
put them in so we can see that we're

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,980
kind of getting some layouts and some

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,890
components working together here but

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,300
it's still in this fixed approach and

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,820
basically we're going to take this

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,579
example and then go on and see how we

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,850
can extend this with bricks and

00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:39,880
modifiers so let's have a look at the

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,360
bricks module and see how that kind can

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,060
work with paragraphs now the bricks

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,850
module sounds like a scary thing it

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,130
sounds like a whole new concept it even

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,620
may sound like a competitor to other

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,630
entities such as paragraphs but really

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,580
that is the wrong way to think about it

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,360
the brics module is a perfect

00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:04,660
accompaniment to paragraphs it works in

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,200
unison with it and basically brings you

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,390
know layouts and view modes in with the

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,790
the power of paragraphs and brings them

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,710
all together so at the heart of the

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,890
brics module we're really just talking

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,920
about a field the Brix field and that

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:23,650
Brix field is just a list of entity

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,470
references it's just a very simple

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:29,140
relationship in an ordered list heading

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,030
off to other entities but in this case

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,760
there is a couple of bits of magic you

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:38,200
know one of the bits of magic is the

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:41,890
layout so you can see there in the you

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,230
know the horizontal box there that we're

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,840
able to select a layout from a list of

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,510
layout plugins so this layout is

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,060
actually a paragraph with a bundle

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,480
called layout and that bit of magic says

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,700
to Brick's hey go into the layout

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,220
plugins load them up and let the user

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,160
select one of them so here we have you

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:07,020
know the layout plugins being loaded up

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,370
as a piece of content as a paragraph

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,190
secondly on the left hand side you can

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,020
see this drag-and-drop interface where

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,560
you're able to move different paragraphs

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:20,560
around in a nice sort of compact UI you

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,420
can also see that it's nested so in the

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,460
case of that layout that's sort of a

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,360
position one and then we've got two

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,790
items underneath it the images and

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,120
another layout there so that is that's

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,820
how the this is being put two together

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,380
and finally down the bottom we have I've

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,750
just circled the the defaults that

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,980
that's basically showing a View mode so

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:46,500
in this case we're showing the default

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:50,350
View mode of that particular paragraph

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,700
so what we have here is basically what I

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,190
call bringing the best of Drupal

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,380
together we have the components we have

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,769
the layout and we have the view modes

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,249
and we've brought them all together in

00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:04,050
compact interface now you can do this

00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:07,619
kind of thing with paragraphs and nested

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,809
paragraphs today but you know the UI is

00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:12,059
not so great it's quite expensive and

00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:14,429
it's hard for editors to get their head

00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,339
around it so what we can see here is you

00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:19,019
know the UI being much more compact and

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:22,889
you know basically making it easier for

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:25,829
people to manage these relationships so

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,529
here we are back at our example we've

00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:30,589
just sort of changed the layouts a

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:33,449
little bit it's nothing too fancy but

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:34,799
hopefully you'll get the idea down the

00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:38,129
bottom here you can see we've got a

00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:41,009
50/50 layout that we've used and we've

00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:43,829
dragged those two components in

00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:45,689
underneath it we have our circle

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:48,029
progress indicators in a sort of like a

00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:49,889
four column thing and up here at the top

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,470
we've got the high charts and the

00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:55,350
content in an 8 4 so we've built this

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,319
page out using three different layouts 1

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,559
2 3 and we've dropped the different

00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:03,480
paragraphs in now if you were going to

00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,029
do this with fewer paragraphs it would

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,589
actually be quite difficult one of the

00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,910
approaches I've seen people do is they

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:10,769
make these kind of Frankenstein

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,980
paragraphs where you might say let's

00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:15,600
have a high charts content sort of

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,999
arrangement where you're actually

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,579
building the layout in but the problem

00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:23,610
there is you've got one paragraph doing

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:25,079
two things and you know it's it's not

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,600
really sort of factored out in a very

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,699
nice way here when we've got the layouts

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,709
that are sort of outside we're able to

00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,589
have much more control about how we

00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:37,679
place those those paragraphs into the

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:40,829
layout and for I'm finally here we've

00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,379
just expanded out there those circle

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,879
paragraph ones out to to the edge bleh

00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,939
you're sort of busting them out of the

00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,740
their container so you can see you know

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:53,749
we've got quite a lot of flexibility

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,009
here in how we how we lay the page out

00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:56,899
let's go in and have a look at the

00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,819
editing interface

00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:03,299
I'll talk quickly but here here we have

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:06,959
the Brix field and you can see we've got

00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:09,180
the layouts here so in this case it's a

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,430
two column a for layout up

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,750
top and we're also just going to have a

00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,220
quick look at the view modes here's a

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,070
bunch of standard view modes that we

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,800
support in our site I'm now moving items

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:23,220
up for the the top and bottom there and

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,900
we're clicking Save and so when we come

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,670
back we can see that the highcharts has

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,100
flicked over to the right-hand side and

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,370
we've also reversed the order of those

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,930
are sort of two down the bottom so

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,790
that's that's really you know the guts

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,530
of the the brics interface there it

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,130
allows it sort of easy dragging and

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:45,830
dropping of components inside the

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:49,800
different layouts and also selecting the

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,090
View mode as well you can also see there

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,430
in the in the interface it's got a

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,410
little spot for CSS classes too that can

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,780
be quite handy for for just dropping

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,180
classes onto those individual components

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,970
so in a sense that's like a poor man's

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,530
version of Class C paragraphs if you

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,840
will that the interface is not as

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:12,330
polished but it's still sort of achieves

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:14,430
the same thing one of like the the Brix

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,530
module is currently under you know quite

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,410
a lot of development and new features

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,810
have been added regularly you've seen

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,810
the support we have there for paragraphs

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:27,030
now natively but they're bricks it was

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:31,560
also supporting dynamic entity

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:33,180
references and this is really cool when

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,610
I first heard about the dynamic entity

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,710
reference module I thought awesome

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,960
this is a module that you know solves a

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,520
problem in Drupal and you know for me

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,880
that one of the problems in Drupal is

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,820
there's a very strong concept of entity

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,920
types and entity IDs going around as a

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,740
pair so you know if you look at the API

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,360
you'll often see those sort of going

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,310
around as a pair and it makes it quite

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,650
difficult to to combine different

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,770
entities from different entity types and

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,650
the dynamic entity reference module

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:07,740
overcomes their problem by extending it

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,020
an allowing lists of entities from

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,120
various types so for example you could

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,170
have a list of a list with nodes and

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,180
users and taxonomy terms all in one list

00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,340
now this has been a slow burner of a

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,929
module and I think it's awesome to see

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,749
that this has now been

00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:27,749
adopted in bricks so if we come through

00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:29,489
and have a look at this page that's a

00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:32,759
pretty pretty hard to see but on this

00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:36,090
one here we have paragraph being shown

00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,889
and we've also got the admin user being

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,109
shown here so this is quite experimental

00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:42,749
its new in the dev branch and it's only

00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:44,549
been there a couple of weeks but we can

00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:48,509
see here that we're actually mixing in

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:50,820
users and paragraphs in the same layout

00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:53,119
and the thing that you know brings it

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,589
all together is the view modes as well

00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,049
so now that you've seen this you can

00:19:55,589 --> 00:20:00,059
start conceiving systems of having view

00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:02,580
modes that are consistent not just

00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,830
within the mode but also across your

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,289
other content types so you could have a

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,440
teaser view mode for a user and a teaser

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,089
view mode for a node and you can put

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,859
them you know arrange them in this way

00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:15,960
and you're going to have a consistent

00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,460
interface so I think that's a really

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,559
exciting thing that we're you know

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,749
breaking down some of the barriers there

00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,749
and making this system more flexible

00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:32,339
okay moving on to modifiers so as I said

00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:35,159
modifiers project is one I've been

00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:37,559
working on with the team you know for

00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:41,070
the last year we've really been driven

00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,049
by you know a desire to encapsulate the

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,629
cool stuff in the Drupal theme layer and

00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:48,239
make that available to editors in an

00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:50,609
easy way so we're not trying to put sort

00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:52,710
of theme as out of a job but we really

00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:54,809
don't think you should be spending time

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,149
in the theming layer constantly

00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,039
reinventing the wheel what we want to do

00:20:57,149 --> 00:21:01,109
is wrap that up into a little component

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,979
and allow you to apply that in two

00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:06,899
entities as you like so let's just jump

00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:08,789
straight into it here we have the demo

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,249
we can see that we've now got a blue

00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,279
background and white writing on that div

00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:16,799
and we've just got a parallax image down

00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:19,289
the bottom there so a fairly sort of

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,259
simple example but we were just showing

00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:24,089
that we can take that page this little

00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,169
demo page and then sort of trick it out

00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:29,019
with some presentational

00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,850
aspects so this this one up there no

00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:32,710
change here we've got the background

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,460
color and foreground colors being

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:40,239
changed and here we have parallax image

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,859
being applied so you can see that we're

00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:44,470
basically building things up components

00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:48,249
bricks and modifiers and they're all

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:51,070
building up to to work together jumping

00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:53,350
into the editing interface now we're

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,059
going to scroll down got the bricks that

00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,450
we know and love and we're going to edit

00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:00,220
a section here and we're going to come

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,350
down and we can see on this section this

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,340
is the one with the parallax image so

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,340
we're just going to remove that old

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,350
image come along and select a new

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,820
picture of clouds right so we didn't

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,700
like those old clouds let's put some new

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,070
ones in and we've basically changed that

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,239
modifier and now we're going to to click

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:21,879
Save and we can see we'll come back and

00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:23,590
you know the display has has been

00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:25,239
updated with the new picture of clouds

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,059
which of course you can't see but I'm

00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:32,859
sorry about that guys monitor is too

00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:34,389
bright so anyway at least it's

00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:39,759
accessible right we've got a nice sort

00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:41,950
of contrast going on there yes so you

00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,039
know basically the modifiers are being

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:50,259
applied as a field onto those different

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:53,409
entities and then altering it so how to

00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:56,080
modify as work so now's as good a time

00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:58,330
as any to explain it right and

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,799
oftentimes people do ask me just just

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:05,649
what is the the magic behind them when

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,419
we were designing modifiers initially we

00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,539
did design them so that they were very

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:12,100
closely coupled in with entities but

00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,769
then we took a step back and said no

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,429
that's sort of tying it into tightly

00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:20,470
let's tie it into a selector so with a

00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:23,320
selector you can theoretically target

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:26,049
any div on a page or anywhere where you

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,899
can select that particular HTML element

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:31,629
and this at its heart means that

00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:33,399
modifies theoretically could be applied

00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:36,519
to the header or the footer or order

00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:38,400
teaser items or or whatever but in this

00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:43,160
particular demo today

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:46,710
how it applies to entities specifically

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,690
so a little bit of code the magic

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,570
happens in Hall Kennedy view Walter and

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,330
this walk is fired when an entity is

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,210
being displayed with a view mode which

00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,190
is that the dollar display there and

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:03,660
what happens is this build array gets

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:05,880
updated with CSS and JavaScript and

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,950
different attributes so the name of the

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,040
game here is for us to update that build

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,980
array with data that is present in the

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,660
modifiers so this is some cut down code

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,810
and I'll just quickly go through so you

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:22,410
understand what's happening first off we

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:24,840
get the entity ID and that is basically

00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,400
the idea of the the paragraph and then

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,500
we'll just make up a little class for

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,290
that modifiers ID and then the ID name

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:35,070
so this is the the handle that we have

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,260
now for this particular element and we

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,660
will place this ID on the element so

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:43,170
that we can then address it via the

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,870
JavaScript and CSS we load up a

00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:49,290
modifiers service and that service will

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:51,660
take the modifiers field and basically

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,850
make a whole stack of little config so

00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,620
for each modifier we've applied we'll

00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:59,370
get a little nice beautiful little

00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,200
associative array of configuration we

00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,960
give other modules a chance to alter

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,310
that so I can also hook there so other

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,280
modules can come in and change that

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:10,110
array if they like and then finally we

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,840
come down and we actually apply those

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,540
modifications so what happens is the the

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,940
modifiers object here is processing

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:21,810
those modifications and coming up with a

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,810
whole stack of modifier objects and then

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:28,260
those modifier objects are applied

00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:29,460
through to the particular build array so

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,900
breaking that down that it basically

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,640
means what we're doing is we're

00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,530
assembling all the CSS and the

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,140
JavaScript and the JavaScript settings

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,760
and putting it down into that builder

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,070
ray so we're really trying to take

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,840
everything that that build array has and

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:46,470
abstracting it out so that the modifiers

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,820
can come in and change that so let's

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,820
just have a look at a concrete example

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,370
here we have our parallax background

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,040
water

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,020
fire so it's implementing modifier

00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,690
plug-in base so the modifiers are

00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:02,170
plugins so you can go out and define

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:04,120
your own if you like and in this case

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,490
we're really saying hey we want these

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,940
two libraries please include those in

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,610
one - thank you we want this JavaScript

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,190
Settings array let's build that out

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:18,130
great and we've also got some CSS in

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,170
here for a fallback background color can

00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,480
you please put that in so we build all

00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,760
those things up and then we just go off

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,380
and make a new modification so we're

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,600
just sort of gathering together all

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,000
those those different properties and

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,740
making a modification and at the end of

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,900
the day that modification goes through

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,800
to the the whole candy view altar and

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,140
does its magic on the build array so

00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,230
yeah basically that's the way you know

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:48,550
we've abstracted out modifiers and how

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:53,490
they're able to plug in I'm just gonna

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,490
have a quick sip of water sorry guys

00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,950
okay so that all sounds a bit

00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,750
complicated I know we've done a lot of

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,990
the hard work for you and we've also

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,350
released the modifiers pack to help you

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,830
out

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:11,770
and this contrib module supports a

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:14,380
number of you know modifiers to help you

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:17,170
get up and running very quickly so you

00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,270
can come in download this and there will

00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,220
be a whole lot of sub modules in there

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,110
and you can enable that and once you

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,360
enable it the configures bring up the

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:27,730
modifier will be there and you can then

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,760
start using that on your own

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:34,050
entities you know we support like a lot

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,640
of sort of eye candy kinds of

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:39,880
backgrounds here you've just seen colors

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,530
images different gradients parallax and

00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,440
video right so this is a really nice

00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,760
grab bag of tools that you know

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,300
marketers and editors are going to

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,980
really like to use to sort of spice up

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:54,940
their pages and it really brings a lot

00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,559
of sort of creative capacity to to

00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,650
editors to quickly add this kind of

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,750
stuff to the page we've also got another

00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,090
sort of a bunch of utils in

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,400
therefore you know achieving you know

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:10,000
different effects and you can mix and

00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,830
match those as required so that's the

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,840
modifiers pack if you try modifiers

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,580
please download the modifiers pack

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,330
because that's the thing that's going to

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,040
help you get up and running

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,410
all right let's return back to those

00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,560
first two questions we had at the start

00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,180
of the presentation you know the first

00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,280
one was you know how much time do you

00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,370
actually spend solving customer problems

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:36,100
versus you know doing repetitious tasks

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,270
in the drupal back-end and you know one

00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,240
of the things about the Drupal community

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,400
is we spend so much time trying to to

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,020
automate and make things more you know

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,480
make things faster and more reproducible

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,470
and you know this is what we've tried to

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,750
do you know with the modifiers module if

00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:56,140
you are able to get a nice set of

00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:58,330
layouts a nice set of components a nice

00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,550
set of view modes and a nice set of

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,320
modifiers you can bring them all

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,600
together and have a system that is

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,330
insanely flexible and allows you to

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,980
build sites out very quickly when we

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,440
first started building Drupal 8 sites

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,880
you know they were they were mammoth

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,100
things right you know we would be there

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,820
for six months trying to build something

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,290
custom nowadays now that we've got this

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,320
sort of toolkit we're able to build

00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,580
sites out in you know four or five weeks

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,800
and you know we've really sort of done

00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,720
away with a lot of the head scratching

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,400
and hair pulling that can go on when

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,460
you're doing things from scratch each

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,440
time and you know this has really

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,720
allowed us to spend more time you know

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,610
with the customer and trying to work out

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,560
what they need and how that site is

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,780
going to be put together to you know to

00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:48,130
answer the questions and and their

00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:50,620
demands secondly you know once a site is

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:53,440
delivered how responsive is it to future

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:56,140
needs I think once you have these set of

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,310
components you're also not just

00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,890
delivering something that's more

00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:03,640
flexible but it is going to be much more

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:06,640
you know predictable and extensible in

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,530
the future so I mean having that tool

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,050
kit there for editors means that they're

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,910
able to mix and match as required you

00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,440
know and the the combinations that

00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,029
they're able

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,240
do with you know the different view

00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:20,970
modes and layouts gives them a lot of

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,250
express you know be ok expressivity if

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,169
that's a word going forward and if they

00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,049
have a new feature that they need

00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:29,820
you can then evaluate that and say ok

00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,509
this is worthwhile let's put it into the

00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,940
platform

00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:35,220
let's encapsulate that into a component

00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,620
a layout or or a modifier and you're

00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,629
improving the system as a whole so what

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,240
you're doing as a developer is you know

00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,740
giving people a scalable system and

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,629
you're getting reuse out of your code

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:50,970
and that can only be a good thing we've

00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:53,039
seen where we've come from now it's time

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:58,080
to have a quick look at where we could

00:30:53,039 --> 00:31:00,480
you know possibly be going you know when

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,570
you look at Drupal you know these days I

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,149
see that there's a rapid change going on

00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,340
in Drupal 8 you know lots of amazing

00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:10,379
things are being added to Drupal 8 all

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,389
the time we have

00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:14,340
you know layouts and we have the the

00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:17,370
Settings tray and we've you know we've

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:20,429
had a lot of and sort of developments

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:23,100
going on in this area in Drupal core but

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:24,750
I also see you know ideas coalescing you

00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,899
know from different parts of the

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:31,139
ecosystem we've seen the layout builder

00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:33,419
using these ideas of sort of stackable

00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:36,299
layouts and we also seeing the bricks

00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:37,860
module taking this approach as well so I

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,200
think that's an idea that that's really

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,259
going to you know continue to expand and

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,730
I can see you know lots of little sort

00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,950
of layouts you know supporting these

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:51,120
kind of new ways of building pages out I

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,220
haven't really spoken too much about

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,070
layout builder in this presentation

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,139
that's because at the moment in my

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,330
opinion the layout builder is really

00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:03,299
sort of targeted at site builders

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,919
putting together the blocks for content

00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:07,500
types right it's dealing with that sort

00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,509
of the big picture stuff of what a page

00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,059
can look at what I've been trying to

00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:13,789
look at here today is the content side

00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,929
of things and focusing on bricks

00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:17,580
paragraphs and modifiers

00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:19,350
now each one of these three things

00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,919
they're all implemented as entities

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:25,440
they're treated as content not config

00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,960
and it's they're really living in the

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,690
world

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,369
of the editor and so I'm really just

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,190
sort of drawing a distinction there on

00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:36,100
persona site builders versus editors but

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:38,379
also content versus confit and I think

00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,240
it's a conceptual differentiator here

00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:42,580
that the paragraphs bricks and modifiers

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,559
are all basically content that's living

00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,659
in a you know a living breathing site

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,830
that's controlled by the editors rather

00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:52,419
than the site builders it's been great

00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,369
to see you know the bricks module

00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:56,289
bringing together all of these things

00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:59,110
breaking down the boundaries that have

00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:01,029
existed previously you know we've we've

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,519
now got dynamic entity references being

00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:06,129
brought to the fore and layouts sort of

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,860
working in nicely with the components

00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:13,929
that you've built there's a really cool

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,080
project that I've just recently found

00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:20,159
out about and this is by Steven fondant

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:23,610
out and he's released a proof-of-concept

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,840
module called paragraphs front and UI

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,539
now there's this little animated gif is

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,590
pretty low res but I think it will give

00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:36,279
you enough of an idea the settings tray

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:38,440
is available via a contextual link here

00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:41,139
so you can see the Settings tray opening

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,149
up and the different properties of the

00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:46,029
paragraph are being edited in the

00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:48,340
settings tray so what we have is we're

00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:51,039
not editing the content per se but we're

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,809
and sort of pulling the levers and you

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,389
know turning the dials here and actually

00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:57,669
sort of configuring how that thing works

00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:59,649
but it's still content stored in the

00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:02,200
paragraph when it comes time to actually

00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:04,570
editing the text on the page that's sort

00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,029
of done over you know on in the

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,980
left-hand side there so here we can see

00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:10,780
this outside in approach that the dress

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,589
is spoken about being applied not just

00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,629
to configuration but also content now

00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:18,520
Steven says this project is just a proof

00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,980
of concept and it's designed to

00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,020
encourage you know thought and

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,389
discussion in the Drupal community about

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,540
what can be possible you know with

00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:30,309
interfaces of the future and I think if

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,740
you you know take the ideas here it

00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:35,379
would be quite easy to extend them into

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,149
the way brics applies things and as well

00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,659
as the modifiers we've seen that the

00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:40,609
bricks and modifiers are kind of

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,010
stuck away a little bit on the the edit

00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:44,750
page but if we're able to use this

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,250
paradigm it's really bringing them up

00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:50,690
and putting them into their hands of

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:54,619
editors even more so let's have a look

00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,659
at a possible recipe for the future and

00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,730
really I mean this stuff here is right

00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:01,430
here today and we've got the settings

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,599
tray nearly arrived in Drupal that's

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,089
providing the outside-in

00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,520
experience and this can be used for

00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,220
config and for content we've got the

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,780
layout builder for site builders you

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,690
know building their big sort of global

00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:16,970
picture things for handling that the

00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,220
content types and the various view modes

00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,589
and then we've got the paragraphs bricks

00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,140
and modifiers sort of combo that's sort

00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:28,220
of working together on the on the

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:29,930
content side of things you know I spoke

00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,900
positively about the way the bricks

00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,910
module handles the editing interface on

00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:38,150
the the node it provides a really nice

00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:40,099
sort of compact view of the world but it

00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,319
is also quite technical I think it

00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:45,230
probably suits you know that the

00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:47,510
technical minded Drupal folks who would

00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:49,700
may be using that but really for editors

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,670
having that outside-in experience is

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:55,670
also going to be you know a massive sort

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,079
of positive for them as well and I think

00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,569
you know this is a kind of space where

00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,770
there's a lot of stuff happening I don't

00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:02,539
know if this is going to be a winning

00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,460
recipe or not but I think it's certainly

00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:07,339
something that's interesting and it'll

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,680
be very interesting to see how the

00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:13,430
country of space develops here in the

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,180
future Tony Stark

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:19,579
Anton he is the the author of the the

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:23,119
bricks module and he will be you know

00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:26,210
presenting on Thursday living design

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,819
systems for teams he will be you know

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,579
speaking about a lot of the ideas I've

00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:33,490
gone into here and applying them to

00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:37,010
component systems and how they can work

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:39,619
and finally I'll just do a quick plug

00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:41,420
before the the Sprint's on Friday if you

00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:43,910
guys around on Friday please head along

00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,519
to the the Sprint's and get involved

00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,500
there

00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:49,720
so that's basically it you know what

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,059
I've tried to present to you today is

00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,660
something that's relatively new the

00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:57,730
brics module really only has about 400

00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,529
installs the modifiers module has

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,480
probably got about 70 or something

00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:04,240
there's very sort of early days for

00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,549
these modules but I think that they you

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,460
know combined it can combine together to

00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:12,299
form a really sort of good ecosystem

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:16,269
combining it in with paragraphs and

00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:18,789
other entities so yeah thank you very

00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:22,259
much and thanks for coming along and I

00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:22,259
really interesting new question

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:29,240
[Applause]

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,340
so I don't really know the drill bit

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,450
there's a microphone up there so I you

00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,810
know I really want to hear some

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:38,750
discussion we do have probably about

00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,610
well a good 20 minutes if you would like

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,850
to talk so yeah please head on up and

00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:47,720
and ask away

00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:50,300
hi so I'm curious about the example you

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,970
showed with modifiers the way that I

00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,340
would normally achieve that would be to

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,290
add a field on those entities to say Oh

00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,760
make this a blue background or a white

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:03,500
background or change the parallax image

00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,600
can you say more about why you would

00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,630
choose to use a modifier versus just

00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,760
creating a field for those options

00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:13,580
yeah well the main thing is the modifier

00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,550
is a pluggable it's pluggable right so

00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,920
you can just add a lot of one modifiers

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:21,710
field and then add multiple modifiers in

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,240
so you can add a parallax one you can

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,150
add the colors in and you can basically

00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,660
build out the presentation combining

00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,100
multiple modifiers at once if you're

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,690
just going to do it as fields just say

00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,220
you had ten different modifiers you'd

00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,770
have to have like ten different sets of

00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,750
fields right so you know your paragraphs

00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,340
are going to get very complex because

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,080
you're just adding in all this stuff

00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:45,860
basically so this is just a way to

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,900
abstract at one level and allows you to

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,690
apply it that way

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,000
gotcha and so also with fields you would

00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,740
need to do some custom theming to say

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,900
what you know when you add that field

00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,910
you'd be saying you'd be providing a

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,920
class and then creating something in a

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,470
theme that says what that class does and

00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,480
it sounds like with modifiers it you

00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:08,660
don't do any custom theming is that

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,700
correct yes yes and no 99% yes you know

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,590
like like all those modifiers you saw

00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,180
there did something quite explicitly I'm

00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,340
going to put this image you know on that

00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,530
div and that's just the way it is right

00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,950
there's no further modification needed

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,360
so but you know of course you may we'll

00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,370
want to theme some things it's not

00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,560
completely doing away with theming but

00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:30,110
certainly we try to encapsulate it as

00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,580
best we can so it is a unit that that

00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:36,440
does what it says on the tin I think the

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,280
concept of classy paragraphs and we've

00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,870
also got another

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,540
you'll called entity class for matter

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:44,330
which have can apply to any entity in

00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,580
Drupal 8 but applying a class through a

00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,080
drop-down on an engineer is an

00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,450
incredibly powerful thing right it's

00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,900
much much simpler for an editor to say

00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:55,490
hey I want the blue background or the

00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:58,310
red background for example rather than

00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,600
having to add a modifier in I didn't

00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,730
talk about this but we've got another

00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,610
module called the look modules basically

00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:07,280
it's like applying a look and feel to a

00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:10,190
page and it's possible to define a set

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,070
of modifiers in a look and you can then

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,710
wire that into a class so you could have

00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:20,450
the I want my fancy trigons background

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:21,950
with white writing sort of look and that

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,660
you can just then select that with a

00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,370
with a drop-down that that's like

00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,380
another step of abstraction I didn't

00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,540
want to go into today but but that was

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,850
that's the power of being able to define

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,320
different selectors rather than entities

00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:35,510
so you can actually use that approach to

00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,790
style start styling up there the header

00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:39,920
and the footer and and things like that

00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:42,020
as well just depends how crazy you want

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,490
to go but just keeping it simple

00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,100
yeah we're just supplying that the

00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,660
modifiers direct to the the entity so I

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,820
think all those background ones the eye

00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:52,130
candy ones they're going to be nice easy

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,770
ones to put on but maybe you might have

00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:58,040
a drop-down that handled the padding or

00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:59,840
something like that you know how how

00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,090
your theme actually wanted to deal with

00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,830
that so it's just a matter of mixing and

00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:07,160
matching and I think having a class

00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:10,340
selector is still very helpful which is

00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:13,070
different to what modifiers provides and

00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,560
sorry for hogging the mic one last thing

00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,840
so do you see the techniques that you've

00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,450
shown as more appropriate for site

00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,570
builders or for content contributors

00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,490
because I I think a little bit of this

00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:28,280
might get a little overwhelming for the

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,320
typical non-technical you say skilled

00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,300
editor right in it yeah like more of an

00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,670
administrator at someone who wants to

00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,990
get involved like an old fashioned

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,030
producer I guess someone who really

00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,340
wants to kind of understand the system

00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:42,590
I'm not saying yeah or all that is are

00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,170
going to naturally feel at home of going

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,460
oh I'm going to add this modifier in but

00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,820
that's the way we've tried to build it

00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,000
right

00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,680
it's like yeah add that one in and put

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,750
it on so I mean where that's what we're

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,160
shooting for but the whole idea is that

00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,260
the site builder and the developer

00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,630
developed the tools that the the editors

00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,280
can use and I think with that outside in

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,680
approach it's going to be if you know

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,570
you can imagine you edit this paragraph

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,430
and you see them modify just popping up

00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,230
then you just tweak it and click Save

00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,840
and it updates I mean that that is a

00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,340
much more editor friendly approach and

00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,690
that could be something for the future

00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,550
yeah cool thank you thank you

00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,820
great talk thanks for talking about

00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:24,740
bricks we actually use it very majorly

00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,810
on our site and we have like the skilled

00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,990
content editors like successfully

00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,490
managing bricks pages and everything I'm

00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:34,910
kind of curious about your thoughts on

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:37,570
using ec k as like entity construction

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:40,700
kit as opposed to using paragraphs

00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:43,670
mostly because the paragraphs like are

00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:46,610
kind of inaccessible to to the rest of

00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:49,670
the site because we we found that you

00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:51,110
could actually go into an e CK entity

00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,910
and edit something and where you're not

00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,130
even on the page yeah yeah great

00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,540
question so I mean when when the bricks

00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,720
module first came out that was the

00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,790
paradigm you'd go into e CK define and

00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,530
you know an entity type may be called

00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,660
brick or whatever you wanted to call it

00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,800
and then you define your own bundles and

00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,360
you know effectively that was kind of

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,070
replicating maybe what you had in the

00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,110
custom blocks world or the paragraphs

00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,700
world so we already had a set of custom

00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,710
blocks that did that we had a set of

00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,300
paragraphs that did that was like oh no

00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,580
I don't want to have to go and make

00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,310
another entity so for me it was it was

00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,020
quite nice to see paragraphs being

00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,090
supported but but I think with this

00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,100
dynamic entity reference that you have

00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,080
now that does mean that you can make

00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,260
some match so if you want a global block

00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,240
go make a custom block and go and still

00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,000
you know and then you can just mix and

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:41,120
match and put that that one in as well

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,100
but that's I you know I guess it's the

00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,960
both sides the divide is it scoped into

00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,150
the content or is it a global thing and

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,130
of course having reusable blocks can be

00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,130
very helpful as well yeah we actually

00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:54,950
are using e CK and paragraphs with

00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:57,080
bricks yeah it works seamlessly so it's

00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,109
really nice and and why wouldn't you've

00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,349
gone with like

00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:04,460
some block rather than ACK we actually

00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:07,289
are using blocks to show different views

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,269
so we create a view that has a block and

00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:12,869
then the bricks page can show that view

00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:14,309
yeah yeah yeah it's really flexible I

00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:16,769
like it yeah we got told you want like

00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:18,569
that yeah they on the overview paragraph

00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:22,349
or whatever you had to later to pull

00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:23,759
that stuff in yeah see but you know yeah

00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:25,410
you're gonna have little edge cases

00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:27,150
there I mean views aren't entities that

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,829
you can put in so sometimes you need a

00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:34,650
little bit of glue why can't you to get

00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:37,829
those working thanks yeah you pointed to

00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,839
this a little bit at the ends so if if

00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:42,239
you want your answer to be good at the

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,089
session later in the week and find out

00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,970
there that's okay but I'm just wondering

00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:50,640
your thoughts on how this fits into like

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:54,809
component based design through pattern

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,329
lab or KSS or those sorts of like

00:44:54,809 --> 00:45:00,450
mappings specific components as specific

00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:02,489
specific designs yeah I mean Tony star

00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,499
may be talking about that that later in

00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:06,180
the week I'm not really sure but I guess

00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:08,819
that was really coming down to how you

00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,950
want to model that in your paragraph and

00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:13,140
when that paragraph is being rendered

00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,720
out what template you're going to use

00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,579
and what libraries you're going to pull

00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,930
in there I guess right so you know I

00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:22,109
think the paragraphs will give you that

00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:24,630
flexibility to define the the HTML and

00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:26,999
see so on the so in the backend it

00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:29,039
doesn't add any complexity to the

00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:30,569
paragraph templates so you know no no

00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,160
we're just trying to avoid that at all

00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:33,210
there's I didn't really touch on it

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,460
there but there's a one field called

00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,499
field modifiers that you put onto the

00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,920
paragraph and then that basically pulls

00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:45,599
it

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:47,339
yeah okay cool thanks hi in your example

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,900
with bricks you were kind of going

00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:51,569
through this quickly so I didn't really

00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:56,069
pick up where the paragraphs were in

00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:58,920
there and we were you actually editing a

00:45:56,069 --> 00:46:03,299
node and the bricks is the interface to

00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:05,279
add paragraphs yeah or other paragraphs

00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:08,119
edited separately and then referenced in

00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,119
the brics interface

00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:15,930
let's just see it's gonna come up so I

00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:22,920
mean what are we on here this is the

00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:25,619
this is the full-blown one yeah so I

00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,200
mean yeah this is a node and this is a

00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,640
bricks field week on content components

00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,740
but essentially you're looking at

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:37,170
paragraphs here each one of these things

00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:39,359
is a paragraph so the this layout one

00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,049
this is a special paragraph type of the

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,760
bundle called

00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:43,950
layout and so they're in the bricks

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,109
logic it goes oh if I see a bundle

00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,390
called layout I'm going to go in and

00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:50,609
provide that little drop-down with all

00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:53,010
the the layouts that are provided by the

00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:54,390
layout sort of plug-in system so that's

00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:58,140
a little bit of magic there where it's

00:46:54,390 --> 00:47:00,299
it's pulling that thing in but what this

00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,430
field is doing is it's it's it's got the

00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:05,130
end of it so listen any reference list

00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:08,490
of entities but it's adding the indent

00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:11,940
it's it's handling a layout if that's

00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:14,700
been selected it's got some some CS

00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,900
sorry a class a class in there as well

00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,329
and it's basically you know bringing

00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,640
those those things together into the

00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:22,710
field so there's more data wrapped up in

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,509
the field that that's really where this

00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,180
configuration is being stored so it's

00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:28,529
still the paragraphs that are that

00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,269
they're still themselves you know we're

00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:32,309
not changing those it's just basically

00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:34,980
adding a bit more data in on the field

00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:37,980
level as to how they're arranged okay so

00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,599
you could get this similar effect with

00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,400
the paragraph field

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,470
it's just each paragraph holds that

00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,630
that's why you have it that's right all

00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:47,819
in paragraph yeah yeah a paragraph

00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,099
rather than yeah and we we've been down

00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:51,960
that path before and it's exactly the

00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:54,119
same I mean no it's not really it's not

00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,009
so it's not terribly different you could

00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,289
easily have a layout paragraph yourself

00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:59,849
and have a drop-down and in that class

00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:02,579
with classing paragraphs or whatever

00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:05,759
gets dropped on and then in your theme

00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:07,529
layer you say or every item gets you

00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:09,690
know you extend in some grid or

00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:13,140
something and target that that class

00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:15,240
right so that that pattern we've done

00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,710
that with paragraphs before but the

00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,869
problem is there it's just like the UI

00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:19,079
it's just a bit too spaced out and like

00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:21,209
the

00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,759
nesting the nesting of paragraphs can

00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:26,339
get a little bit crazy sometimes yeah

00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:29,160
okay and then one other question with a

00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:30,529
crib with bricks the layout options that

00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:35,969
are being presented here are those

00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:40,799
definable per node type nerves can be

00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:42,599
limited to yeah this is everything so I

00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:45,029
just think we've got yeah we've got the

00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,999
foam enchilada in here we've we've

00:48:45,029 --> 00:48:51,630
actually defined our own little module

00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:53,789
cork it bricks layouts and so we we've

00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:56,789
basically defined our own set and that's

00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:59,099
that's what we use here so but yeah you

00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:01,979
can see in this list we've got you know

00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:04,140
we support few mode layouts and page

00:49:01,979 --> 00:49:05,789
layouts you know so we've got all these

00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,190
but these we use these ones for the

00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:09,660
pages and we use these ones for the

00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,819
bricks but these are they sort of like

00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,859
layer cake design one so they're not

00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:16,079
these monolithic ones with many steps

00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:17,670
it's just like one column 2 column 3

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,589
column equal columns you know that

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,229
that's the kind of paradigm you you're

00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:24,209
talking about here with with these so

00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:25,650
we've done all these with bootstrap and

00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:29,670
then the equal column is just like a

00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:32,279
flexbox thing to to so it's ok so that's

00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:35,119
potentially when setting up a site that

00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:37,799
is potentially sculptable to a

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,109
constraint set yeah I mean I prefer it

00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:42,089
I'm not I'm not really fully on top of

00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:44,160
that I you know but I do believe there

00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:46,109
are attempts to have libraries of

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,479
layouts and and to find them in

00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:50,099
different cases but yeah knowledge is a

00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:51,329
bit lacking on on that at the moment

00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:55,380
it's just all that all the layouts that

00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:57,869
are there Thanks yep hello and thank you

00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,229
for you talk I was hoping you can help

00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:02,579
me by zooming out just a little bit on

00:50:00,229 --> 00:50:04,410
no not on the screen just zooming out in

00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:06,630
general I'm thinking about page assembly

00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:08,670
in Drupal yeah it's a basic question I

00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,829
apologize but in Drupal 7 I think there

00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,049
was a lot of competing page assembly

00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:15,509
strategies like you were there like

00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:18,809
blocks and context person or panelizer

00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:20,910
IPE or display suite and some people use

00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:23,160
beans there seems like there's a lot of

00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,959
different options for traveling down

00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,209
that road and so I'm trying to get an

00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:28,619
idea of how this fits in the overall

00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:31,170
scheme of how people are doing Drupal 8

00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:32,530
are there what is what does this compete

00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,970
with and if um if I say

00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:38,380
hello to this what am i saying goodbye

00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:40,000
to well you know we're quite open to a

00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,400
lot I think I'm quite promiscuous when

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,340
it comes to the techniques right so huh

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,780
so well you know we use display suite

00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,820
for our little view modes and we use

00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:51,190
panelizer for the content types you know

00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,540
that's just how we like to work with it

00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,770
in that that's the that's the paradigm

00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,810
that we've used all the way back from

00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,820
Drupal 7 which is still doing anyway

00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,470
we love paragraphs we're still using

00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:02,050
paragraphs right so we haven't really

00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,850
said goodbye to any of those things you

00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:07,180
know we use beans as well you know the

00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:09,340
previous question before was about how

00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,900
can you reuse blocks well of course you

00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,180
know beans were the equivalent of custom

00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,680
blocks now and they're very very handy

00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:19,120
in some cases so yeah we're still using

00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:20,830
those as well you know so I'll just show

00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,030
you one of the crazier things we're

00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:28,330
doing now is that just so you've got a

00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:29,680
complex footer right and it's got it's

00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,030
got all these weird layouts now usually

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,890
in a theme layer you're going to maybe

00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:34,660
have like four PostScript areas and

00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,190
little footer and you're kind of cobble

00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,540
it together and hope that that works but

00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:40,150
then what happens if you come up with a

00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,770
design that's got you know like four

00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:44,410
layers of stuff and it's got to be to

00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:47,920
grid instead of four what we do now is

00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:50,050
we define one region in the theme we

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,490
call it an edit and ideas just at the

00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,210
right at the very bottom and it's just

00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:56,200
an edge-to-edge

00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:58,360
div region and then we've got this block

00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,490
and we just call it the nadir block it's

00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,410
a custom block and that basically has

00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:04,810
bricks in it and then we can just build

00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:06,220
out the whole footer with bricks and

00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:08,290
then we just take that block and put it

00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:10,480
into the theme region and so suddenly

00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:12,640
now with this tool kit we've got a way

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,860
to build our insane blocks and we can

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,270
put all the modifiers on and you know so

00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,580
we're just basically building out that

00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:20,920
whole footer region are really flexible

00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:22,810
way and so we're using this on on

00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,970
distros like just say we have a distro

00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:26,530
and we're trying to support xx marketing

00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,810
sites like each marketing site is

00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,520
different awesome and they've all got

00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:32,410
their own weird foot away but you know

00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,030
we're able to kind of use this system to

00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,100
you know basically put it together in

00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:37,190
config without having to break out into

00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,710
the theme and define

00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:41,119
you knew new layouts I was just going

00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,470
off a bit of a tangent there but I'm

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,510
just going to try and say yeah you can

00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:47,119
kind of put this stuff together an

00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:49,250
interesting ways to overcome you know

00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,050
some of the problems I mean one of the

00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:55,040
design goals we've had is really to try

00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:56,720
to not touch the theme layer and and

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,880
that is to have basically a style guide

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,069
driven you know development that's

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,480
that's providing you know the basic

00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:05,180
typography and stuff but which really

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,369
trying to let the content and the

00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,290
modifiers tell the story and that's the

00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:11,750
way we're trying to build build sites

00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,160
now and so with that in mind we're able

00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:15,170
to it's really we have you know I've

00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,970
been building sites with this approach

00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,710
where we're not really touching the

00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:22,339
theme or if we do it's only to solve

00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:25,520
something really specific what are you

00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:28,490
giving up well I mean this I mean that

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,140
the context paradigm in Drupal 7 you

00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,089
know that's you know that's this

00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,069
different way like where they at the

00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:37,490
moment living in the world of panelizer

00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:39,230
and and still defining the placement you

00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:42,470
know according to content type in in

00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,970
that way but yeah you know you just find

00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:46,490
anyway I mean you know bricks is a new

00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:49,010
thing for us but you know I just really

00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,990
loved it as soon as I saw it because it

00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,089
was all still working with entities and

00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:55,310
it was just fitting nicely you know

00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:56,720
together so I just think you got to

00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:59,180
experiment I don't really know how it's

00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,770
all going to wind up you know but bricks

00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,660
for me has a lot of promise but you know

00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,339
there's a lot of change sort of going on

00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,589
in the ecosystem as well so be

00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:08,839
interesting to see what happens so it's

00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:11,450
just briefly um you had mentioned

00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:13,190
earlier about a winning recipe and so if

00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,140
you adopt kind of a strategy and you're

00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,150
like Adam this isn't community isn't

00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,319
really picking up steam on this have

00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,420
you've had problems in the past like

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,339
going back to your 20 sites and role oh

00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,329
this one did some other kind of strategy

00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:24,829
and this one used this page says

00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:26,270
something I'm doing that every week how

00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:28,220
are you doing that okay we're we're

00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:30,260
pretty adept at writing scripts and

00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:33,859
moving paragraphs around between all

00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,750
these different systems no but if you

00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:36,920
invest a lot of time in your paragraphs

00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,440
they're still going to stay as

00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,500
components right so if if these layout

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,470
systems you know change I mean all that

00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,119
investment you've kind

00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,830
put into those paragraphs is you know is

00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,780
not going away that they haven't been

00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:52,380
deleted or anything you know they're

00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,000
still existing on that that nodes so you

00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,040
know I you know obviously this is a

00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,050
you're buying into the the paradigm when

00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,240
you get into it but it's not it's not

00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:01,680
the end of the world if things have to

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,840
change I think could you still got your

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:08,550
content there and that's the main thing

00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:11,609
excellent thank you good I Thanks I

00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:14,010
really enjoyed the talk you talked at

00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:17,580
the end a little bit about layout

00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:19,710
builders and I was wondering how you see

00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,930
this integrating with that because the

00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,849
example that you kind of showed several

00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:27,960
times that could easily have been built

00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:30,420
with layout builders instead how do you

00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,000
pick which one is it just whichever one

00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:37,410
you think the content editors will be

00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:40,590
more taken with or what's the strategy

00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:43,260
yeah now like I don't want to be someone

00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:44,970
doing pronouncements on on my builder

00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,250
you know the settings tre is is awesome

00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:49,680
and the the visual aspect of it is

00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,740
really cool but I think the distinction

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:55,440
I was trying to draw there is the the

00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:56,790
the node specific nature of paragraphs

00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,339
and that that's really being treated as

00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:01,740
content whereas layout builder is like

00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:03,450
panels you know panels in coarse IPA

00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:07,140
it's it's all these big block things

00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:09,180
you're adding you know views fields and

00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,740
blocks you know that that's that's the

00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,990
kind of thing you're dealing with and

00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,400
you know our experiences with IPA in the

00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,750
past means you have this massive library

00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,750
of blocks right so if you want to do a

00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,339
landing page with 20 sections where you

00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,080
go into your custom blocks and you make

00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:24,540
your 20 custom blocks you give them a

00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,250
specific name like front page top front

00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,990
a you know and then you're trying to go

00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,490
in and go oh where's front page top

00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:31,770
there it is like I'm gonna drag it there

00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:34,080
that's just you're trying to get that

00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:36,180
content from a global namespace into the

00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,890
the page and that you know that's why

00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,720
I'm sort of

00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:40,610
opponent of paragraphs that it's

00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,110
existing in there so I mean I don't

00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:44,060
really know what's going to go on with

00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:46,550
layout builder and paragraphs like I've

00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,600
been told by a core developer that you

00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,610
know they're looking at trying to

00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,680
integrate paragraphs in and that's on

00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:54,650
the the roadmap I mean that's just

00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,230
hearsay but but as we've seen from that

00:56:54,650 --> 00:57:00,140
that paragraphs front-end proof of

00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:02,180
concept that Steven fondant health did

00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,220
that you know we've got that interface

00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,170
with the settings tray that's there to

00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:09,260
manipulate the the paragraphs in the

00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:11,810
same way so you know I'd say concentrate

00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:15,020
on the UI and the editor experience

00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:16,760
maybe not the layout builder side of it

00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,800
you know but that's just my opinion

00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,360
at the moment but you know when we're

00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,650
building pages we're still really

00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,540
sticking with panelizer for now I'm

00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:26,030
waiting for that to become a bit more

00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:28,160
mature but you know I'm not I'm not

00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:30,680
dissing out on a door still you know

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,660
amazing initiative but that that's the

00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,360
there the the system we're using at the

00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:38,360
moment is it too simplistic to say that

00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,980
that is more for like one-off pages

00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,680
whereas the layout builder would be more

00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,910
for this class oh yeah that's that's it

00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,500
exactly you know so going back to

00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:48,380
panelizer you know like you you could

00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,970
define your your your layout for a

00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,650
particular content type and capture that

00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,970
in config but as soon as you came down

00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,430
to the node level thing and did an

00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:57,560
override that was kind of you know

00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:00,970
content so you can do no two overrides

00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:04,190
with this and you can do that but it's

00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:06,230
you know it's not operating on that

00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:08,750
global level anymore so you can do it

00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,880
but I just haven't had good experiences

00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:14,530
with it so yeah that's not going that

00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,530
way all right thank you thank you

00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:22,370
Wow questions I love the questions now

00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:24,770
three minutes any final ones guys all

00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:26,330
right don't forget to Anton's talk

00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,700
coming up on Thursday thank you very

00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:34,060
much

00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:34,060
[Applause]

00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,690
I

00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:48,849
Oh

00:58:52,230 --> 00:59:01,980
yes you just

00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:10,150
I can now relax Kayla months of stress

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:37,170
fit into here so we have basically be

00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:39,720
three different books what is hopefully

00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:43,360
the same

00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,760
so we have this what they're calling a

00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:48,160
level one day edge and this is kind of

00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,580
like what the top level page for each

00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,560
thing to be and it's basically like this

00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:57,690
full page and then the only thing that

00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,690
