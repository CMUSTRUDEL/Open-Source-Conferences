Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Social API: D8's Authentication and Posting Suite for Social Networks
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Almost every website interacts with 3rd party systems and majority of these systems are social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Learn how to authenticate users with every social network and post content in Drupal 8.

All skill levels are encouraged to attend this presentation to see how easy it is to connect social networks into Drupal 8 with simple point/click demos.



Learn about Drupal 8's new suite of modules making up the Social API
Authenticate users with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter with a demo of the Social Auth module
Post content to/from Drupal 8 using a demo of Social Post Twitter and Social Post Facebook
Stop searching drupal.org for various social network related modules and start utilizing a common API embraced by the community saving everyone's time!


Attendees will learn about Social API, suite of related components, and how to implement modules in Drupal 8. As a bonus, learn the history of how this module suite was coded, maintained/supported, and the story behind everything based on Google Code-In (ages 13-17) and Google Summer of Code (university) students.

Did you know that Google funded 2 students (gvso and himanshu-dixit) for Social API with about $11,000 in development during Summer of Code? Did you know the GCI students ages 13-17 have been writing the patches and testing this module?

Learn the story of Social API told by GSoC/GCi admin Slurpee (Matthew Lechleider). We will utilize funding from Google to send both GSoC students who created Social API modules to participate in presentation. It will be truly magical to see the progress of students who only recently learned about Drupal, became a rockstar developers, and ultimately attend a Drupalcon to fully embrace them into our community.

Join us a few hours after presentation in our BoF session in room 102A on 04/10/2018 frin 14:15 to 15:15. Details @ https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/bofs/social-api-google-summer-code-and-google-code

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,569
I'm nobody I'm an old guy in Drupal I've

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,519
been around drupal.org over ten years

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,860

we kind of tricked you guys you want to

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,910
learn about social API but we're really

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,779
actually just gonna talk about google

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,449
Summer of Code and google code-in no I'm

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,080
just kidding that I hooked you guys and

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,710
as we all know in Drupal 8 no more hooks

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,630
all right so here I am I'm from USA

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,160
drupal.org over 10 years if anybody's

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,329
ever been to Chicago you may have seen

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,790
me over the years I founded the

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,680
community out there organized over a

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,289
hundred events Drupal training days

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,489
organized the first several camps now

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,200
it's mid camp and everything but if

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,840
you've been to Chicago that probably see

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,850
me around that's how I started out

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,129
contributing to Drupal organizing events

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,719
community leader type stuff and then I

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,699
eventually got into mentoring and

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,489
organizing the google Summer of Code and

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,170
the code in programs that's a big part

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,820
of my life I do do Drupal development

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,610
really big projects I'm on the forefront

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,200
of Drupal 8 but what I do turn my time

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,710
to contribute back to the community is

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,540
organizing and mentoring students and I

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,950
like skateboarding in music and if

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,729

Drupal community and as I keep

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,110
mentioning that because of these

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,600

API was built by G sock students and

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,530
that's why we're kind of sneaking in the

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,090
story of google Summer of Code and code

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,920

learn if any you have a Drupal website

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,020
and you need to interact with any of

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,270

like who are the companies contributing

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,959

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,300
the past couple years because of us

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,370
we've we've been in the top 50 I think G

sacks in the top 30 so you see all these

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,910
big companies that are sponsoring Drupal

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,799
they're here spending a lot of money but

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,660
it's not only those people contributing

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,680

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,900
hello everyone I'm minding Sanchez

00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,820
I'm from Paraguay I'm currently studying

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,710

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,430
at Swarthmore College we are Lars

00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:38,680
computer science physical science I was

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,400
a Google according to a 2014 grand prize

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,430
winner I did G stock in 2016 I now

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,030
mentoring both programs I like to play

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,490
soccer ping-pong and but but my favorite

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,370
sport is you'd like to add work for

00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,270
Marren station for open data and I

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,140
really like it when data is under arrest

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,140
and now under arrest

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,930
how I going to drop out I go into Drupal

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,510
thanks to sugar labs

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:15,959
basically I wouldn't I got an email from

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:18,489
a mentor for DCI 2013 back in 2013 I

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,019
registered for the competition I wanted

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,480
to complete tasks but there was a

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,550
technical issue and that was English I

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,350
didn't know how to speak English back

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,680
then and I didn't understand anything

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,419
that was going on so the next year I

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,740
decided I told myself I want to learn

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,560
English and I'm gonna finish at least

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,630
three tests next year in 2014 because

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,840
the rule is if you finish through that

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,970
Google will give you a t-shirt and who

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,440
doesn't want a good t-shirt especially

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,720
if you are at June teenager who is an

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,460
Arian like computers you just want to go

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,950
to your high school and like oh look at

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,860
my Google t-shirt is this very cool am i

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,380
cool so I did I completed the first

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,970
three tasks but something amazing

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,760
happened and that is that my first patch

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,370
was committed it was pretty exciting to

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,770
know that someone else in the world will

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,210
be using code that you wrote and I got

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,280
excited about the competition and I

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,620
started working more and more on it and

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,230
at the end of the competition i ported

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,270
like seven modules from Drupal 7 to

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,810
Drupal 8 including the scroll to top

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:24,850
minister users users pyro pyro blog

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:28,000
title link and all these modules and I

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:32,470
was 17 years old when I did that I

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,900
started with DCI and then I got to these

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,470
I contributed patches to core

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,680
to Drupal core and then 2016 I did this

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:44,229
default mu Summer of Code and I work on

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,150
a project called the special API of

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:49,479
course that is the title of the

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,729
presentation and the project to

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:54,759
harmonize authentication and at the post

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:58,770
in touch with external providers such as

00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:04,000
Facebook Google Twitter LinkedIn PayPal

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:06,759
all those all of these providers and I

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,180
like to think that social API ceased

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,639
only because I wanted a t-shirt four

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,979
years ago and this is how my closet

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:20,110
looks like right now it's not because I

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:24,910
am big fan of Google is just because I

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,169
don't like spending money of clothes but

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,470
let's get to business then I get to

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,660
social API what is it but before talking

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,630
about social API I don't want to bore

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,370
you with with ollahm tok in i want to

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,710
show you the call you can get it in

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:42,130
drupal or project with latched social

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,349
API or you can just type it on Google

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:50,650
social API Drupa that probably is the

00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:53,050
first link i hope and i want to start

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,349
with a background idea the project idea

00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,340
i was working on out on a project and I

00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:02,560
wanted to connect users I wanted to

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,010
login users using Google and Facebook

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,650
and Facebook and the problem was that

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,020
there were many modules that was that

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,150
were doing the same thing with different

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,860
providers I have I had a module that was

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,840
doing that for Facebook I know what I

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,260
was doing that for Google but they were

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,210
completely incompatible if you wanted to

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,880
log in users and asked and asked and

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,620
linked accounts from Google and Facebook

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,630
you couldn't do it because they were

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,510
different modules there are not a common

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,789
ground there is not an API going on and

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,830
it was a big problem because they were

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,080
working differently you have to

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,669
configure this module this module was

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,370
completely different one of them were

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:44,169
eat what using the email address the

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,599
other one was using the user ID and that

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,349
was like very confusing

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,119
and also that contributed but that the

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,759
problem contributed idea that Drupal

00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:56,069
it's hard to use and I didn't like that

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,069
it was like no way there should be an

00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:01,949
easier way to connect to other providers

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:05,099
like Facebook and Google without going

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,349
through all these steps so I did an

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,659
intensive first research I went to

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:12,419
google.com died my question and click on

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:15,169
the first link and the first thing was

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,999
about the Drupa social initiative and

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:21,360
these guys were created I mean they

00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:22,939
carry this group like in 2012 and they

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,129
had all this idea of creating

00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:28,110
authentication with a common API out to

00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:30,360
posting all of these cool things that I

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,469
was thinking about I was not alone but I

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,269
was there was a small problem with this

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:38,339
with this project and that was that they

00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:40,769
didn't write any single line of code

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,779
during those four years and I don't know

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,399
if you agree with me but I believe that

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:49,130
code is important in a software

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,980
development project it's a net so I

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,680
contacted Daniel who who was one of one

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,930
of the most active members in the group

00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,660
and he agreed to mentor the problem was

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,610
that even though Daniel's it is great he

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,130
was more a project manager than a

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,290
software developer so I needed a new

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:11,339
mentor that was an enormous or who was

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:13,889
more not that knows more about Drupal in

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:17,160
terms of development and I found out

00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:19,410
about Matteo who is one Twitter

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,759
maintainer of the school modules such as

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,649
woof - and JSON API but I contacted him

00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,319
because he was work he was a maintainer

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,269
of Facebook output post which was

00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,670
similar to what I wanted to do so I

00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:35,279
contacted him and he agreed to mentor

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,649
but the main contribution of matto in

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,740
this project was not that he only mentor

00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,689
the project but but it was that he was

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,420
working on something called social out

00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:47,519
the post it was similar to what I wanted

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,639
to build but only for out the posting

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,250
and the truth is that most of the social

00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,970
API core is based on this initial work

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,660
by motto was social all to post so

00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,660
that's really

00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:06,569
and during this this talk I divided the

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,180
project in two phases and the first

00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:12,480
phase we work on developing the base

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,610
code and undeveloped in the core for

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,680
social API so shallow and social post I

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,110
will show you what is different between

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,240
this modulator and something called

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,129
social widget which is not very well

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,550
known but it's someone when I work on it

00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,860
we can make it work as well and then

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,430
during phase 2 I develop a bunch of

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,529
implementers including desire

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,389
Pro our modules I work on top of this

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:39,420
project and I love you to connect to

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,999
Facebook Google or any other services

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,309
that you want to and we improve and make

00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:48,139
the API more generic during the process

00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:51,720
and this how this the basic architecture

00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:55,649
architecture that we work on and you can

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,649
you can consider each each angle to be a

00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,839
different module and we you have Drupal

00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:03,569
on the bottom and then up top the troop

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,490
up were running social API and on top of

00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:08,970
the social API without social off and

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,339
social post and which are like basically

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,019
the core of all of these projects they

00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,180
were independently of each other do not

00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,430
need one for the other and on top of

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,399
social off you have social off Facebook

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:24,509
Google LinkedIn Twitter and much more

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,189
there are like 25 right now and on top

00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,379
of social posts you have the same thing

00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:31,889
you have social post Twitter LinkedIn

00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:38,009
slack Facebook and hopefully much more

00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:40,199
in the new future and these were the key

00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:42,149
features that we work on naturally I

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:46,199
like to consider then the philosophy of

00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:48,629
the project we work on making it

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,279
protocol and library agnostic we didn't

00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:52,620
want to depend on any protocol we want

00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:57,029
it to be - you wanted a social API to

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,920
work with all to earth one how and

00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,740
whatever library when I use after all is

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,950
just HTTP so it shouldn't depend on

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,960
anything even though right now is using

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,120
PSB the leak as I default library is not

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,100
dependent on that you can build a social

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,370
API implemented without using that

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,980
library and also when it took a common

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:22,240
API Koen functionality because that was

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,550
a problem we were addressing and this

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,440
allow allows people to if I know how to

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,540
connect with Facebook I can do it with

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,250
Google I can do it with LinkedIn I can

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,150
do it with paper it should be the same

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,980
everywhere

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,180
I should already know how to do them if

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,190
I know how to do one of them and also we

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,210
wanted to make it easy to contribute you

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,540
two

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:47,140
in fact GCI students develop new

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,380
implementers in one day like in five or

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,330
seven hours using very sick and

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,280
elemental software development skill

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,910
like copy and pasting code and changing

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,740
names so if I can assure you that it's

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,850
very easy to develop new implementers

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,760
for other services

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:07,480
are you talking about masky that must be

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,620
Isabella social of Amazon in an ER

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,930
student develop social out link Twitter

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,430
two years ago these are GC these are

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,640
high schools these are high school

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:22,420
students working during GCI doing these

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,660
things in one day so it's very pretty

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,660
cool

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,170
but I want to show you have a

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,580
presentation on one of the projects I

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,040
work on this is actually that dated

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:40,000
version up to date this social host

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:42,760
Twitter well I already started I already

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,700
styled the module back but for this

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,520
presentation and then you can go to the

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,820
configuration you go to indicate Twitter

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,820
Oh

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,089
will Twitter and then from Twitter from

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,620
Twitter apps we just copy the API key

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:11,050
and the API is secret to the settings

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,540
just save that now you can go into

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:17,560
configuration there's you can you can

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,180
use the API alone and just coat it if

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,870
you want but you can also use rules

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,480
which is like very cool modules to react

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,880
to events on Drupal so I just use rules

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,940
in this example just go to rules and

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,600
then you can add a new interaction rule

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,889
one that's called

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,170
tweet and then I added action the rights

00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:44,320
after saving new content I'm gonna tweet

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:46,980
something and then you go into add

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,980
action and there is an action that is

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,740
tweet which is which is created by

00:14:50,980 --> 00:15:00,339
social post Twitter then after creating

00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:01,690
the action you type what you want to

00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,269
tweet in this case I want to treat like

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,130
this is a post with title and the title

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,699
of the post during that doesn't know

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:13,570
that I'm that I am posting for Drupal

00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:17,620
core and then I save this I said this

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,149
and I say the rural action and I can

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,910
just go to my account this is my

00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:26,560
username my new sir so I can just scroll

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:28,180
down to my - to the bit forum and I

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,190
think add accounts I can have multiple

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,899
accounts I can add three or four

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:39,990
accounts if I want I will just add one i

00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,990
authorized Twitter and then I go back

00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:48,100
yeah that's account that was linked to

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,519
my to my username now anytime I add the

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,639
content on my site like social post

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:59,100
Twitter that's the title then Lord is

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,100
adding a body and then saving the post

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:08,190
cool it was Trey now now if I go to my

00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:08,190
Twitter account I have the poster

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,029
[Applause]

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,920
that was easy you didn't write anything

00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:20,870
a line of code and the idea that you can

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,009
do that with Facebook it's like or

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:28,459
anything else that you hope that you

00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:30,740
when I work on yep

00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:34,370
and I'm going to reduce you to human two

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:37,490
he improved the social API 1.8 version

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:52,850
and he created more of almost all the

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:54,860
implementers that we now support so my

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,259
name is Malik I'm from India I'm

00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,810
currently 19 year old software developer

00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:02,240
and I've been calling since the age of

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,410
12 so like seven years into coding I'm

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,179
currently studying computer science

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,880
engineering from Rosland Technical

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,380
University which is in jeopardy India

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,870
I've been involved with three

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,970
open-source organization total my first

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,250
contribution was to WordPress where I

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,600
uploaded my personal project I wanted a

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,059
functionality I couldn't find it and

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,579
then I created and uploaded it and then

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:25,130
I got involved I wanted to participate

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,400
in JSON 16 then due to that I got

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,590
involved with Opia after that I got

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,000
involved with Drupal as a part of my

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,130
g-shock 2017 project okay

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,630
apart from that I love to play squash

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,370
badminton and ping pong so all the

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,799
racket sports currently I have go

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,380
founded a startup in India which is

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,750
converting a word space solution from

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:52,340
under utilized species to office

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:55,730
solutions so this is about me

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,350
you know a guy asked I have a Google+

00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,720
Facebook and Skype account the other

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,559
person went to your life he says can you

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,270
send me a link to that so so social

00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,000
network has become a very important part

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,190
of life and at social API we are trying

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,830
to do the same you know by integrating

00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:17,000
social or authentication and posting in

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:20,269
duple websites so I wrote a proposal for

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,940
my g-shock first of all

00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:25,249
as a part of GC 2016 my brother

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,169
participated in with Drupal he created

00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:30,049
social of tutor and became a green

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:33,019
dentist winner so he inspired me to

00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:35,539
become to participate in jisuk with

00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:40,249
drupal in 2017 also like my previous

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:42,950
experience with PHP and integrating a

00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:44,869
social earth-like authentication for

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,419
different social providers like Facebook

00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:49,729
and Google in front-end application

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:52,459
helped me I became a core contributor

00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:54,950
with Drupal by completing 13 core issues

00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:56,479
after that I started writing my proposal

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,129
we are Valentin and met to help me

00:18:56,479 --> 00:19:00,829
refine the proposal and said that

00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:04,940
milestones for the project so thank you

00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:06,679
guys here's a quick note all of the

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,169
ji-suk students that we've selected the

00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,690
past three years have all become core

00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:13,849
contributors prior to us selecting them

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,829
to be even students just a cool little

00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:17,629
note out there that their students that

00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:19,579
are so into becoming these students like

00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:21,979
these guys they're already doing core

00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:25,399
contribute patches writing their own

00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:28,039
modules and then doing their projects so

00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:29,749
we're selecting pretty smart students

00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,519
and again what we'll talk about this

00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:33,079
more if anybody wants to get involved

00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,769
with this we have another Summer of Code

00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,479
coming up here shortly after that I set

00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:40,369
up my Drupal website and contributed to

00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:42,440
social media to learn about the project

00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:45,829
and get involved with it and also quoted

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,690
a project from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 this

00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:51,259
was basically sharing buttons for drupal

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,759
website so like you can see the buttons

00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,589
like we share on facebook and share on

00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,589
google so i putted it from duple 7 to

00:19:54,589 --> 00:20:00,769
Drupal 8 it was one of the more do about

00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:02,929
the development process till 2016 jisuk

00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,109
was basically divided into two phases

00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:07,999
phase one and phase two after that dig

00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:10,070
converted into three phases before the

00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:12,019
development process start we usually

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,249
have a thing called community bounding

00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:15,879
period where you interact with other

00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:17,690
student and learn more about the

00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:19,789
open-source or nation you are

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,399
contributing to so doing that you learn

00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:25,759
the basic things like creating an entity

00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,799
and etcetera in phase one I integrated

00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,869
the PHP League or two library into

00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:32,269
slippe by making it compulsory

00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,880
they were dependency that must be used

00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,500
in

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,180
and social cost I knew that user

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,200
authentication flow which we will be

00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,720
talking about later in this presentation

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,030
and encrypted the access token stored by

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,800
the social post in the phase two I

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,960
updated the existing implementers

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,900
created by Valentin which were Susheela

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,640
Google social off the Facebook and at a

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,900
new implement it's like a sushi lock

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,200
installed a masseuse or github etc in

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,560
Phase three

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,420
I created social post LinkedIn so as

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,740
well he showed you the demo of social go

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,480
student you could do the same with

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,310
Sousou post LinkedIn added more

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,830
implementer so the all the images that

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,510
you saw earlier were created by me

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,520
route the documentation for social

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,110
earth-based implementers and social

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,460
coercion renter so if anyone want to

00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,690
create their own implement they can go

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:21,710
ahead and like follow just see the Koren

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,840
liquid or their own implemented after

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,020
doing the development process one thing

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,150
that helped us was Ostrom that was

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,550
implemented by Matthew who's ever heard

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,720
of scrum project manager alright I told

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,890
you this is a rule they didn't believe

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,180
me they thought I was crazy when I

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:41,790
started making him do scrum your last

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,920
question when you started doing scrums

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,270
every student says I don't want to do

00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,830
this I don't want to check in and give

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,660
you a report and all this stuff every

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:58,590
day but now that you're done with it

00:21:48,660 --> 00:22:01,560
does it make sense so one of the thing a

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:05,220
main goal of my project was to implement

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,830
the league over to library we did want

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,530
to a like implement a any library that

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,360
can easily implement can be easily be

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,580
extended across all the implementers but

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,590
there was like hybrid earth but he

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,750
thought it was like discontinued and not

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,850
actively maintained so we went to like

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,320
elite what to library but some of the

00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,210
features of leak over to library are

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,130
there they provide command check method

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,800
for all the different all the social

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,530
networks we like you could easily go

00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,960
ahead and create implement library

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:36,270
ex-parte libraries for that the packages

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,190
of League or two library are thoroughly

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,800
tested and follow the modern coding

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,710
students and this like long list of

00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,110
social network libraries for PHP in

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,450
peacefully clapping here I'm gonna go

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,090
back to that slide just so anybody that

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,250
doesn't know the PHP League it's kind of

00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,870
like an organization it's an

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,409
organization that developed a lot of

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,120
libraries not only for Alf - oh the

00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:03,000
authentication they develop many other

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,659
things and anything common in Drupal or

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,380
in PHP like a CSV uploader

00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,450
authentication there's groups of people

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,250
and PHP outside of Drupal that are

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,169
saying hey if we're gonna do the same

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,240
common thing let's do it together and

00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:17,279
collaborate so we're not all redoing the

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,190
same work and that's what the PHP League

00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,110
is and where we got the like of core

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,460
libraries for the authentication stuff

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:28,409
and applied it to Drupal of course apart

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,850
from that some of the changes done by

00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:34,710
means your software before discipline 17

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,360
we did not have like any entities so I

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,480
created a universal entities for

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,460
susheela institution post implementers

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,919
we were storing the access token for the

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,240
user so every time users log in we got

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,490
actual like storing the access token

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,980
which can be used further to perform

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,890
actions on his behalf and encrypting the

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,590
token and store my social post and other

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,950
thing we added as a part of my project

00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,750
was we were having a we could collect

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,549
like extra data during the time of

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,679
authentication so for example if anyone

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,320
is logging from su support sue or

00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,210
Facebook we could collect like you could

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,980
define scopes and like data you want to

00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,010
collect like his friend list of what

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,370
type of music does he like etc thing and

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,260
I improved I user authentication flow so

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:23,700
securing the access token

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:26,010
works like a first we encode the token

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,529
into JSON and then encrypt it using a

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,140
open SSL library using a salt and key

00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:33,659
and then sue it in the database and same

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,500
applies that gate token to our method

00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:40,799
but it is in the reverse way so user

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,299
authentication flow so it was like big

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,690
image but we had to split it into two

00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:48,240
parts so one is when user is logged in

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,460
if Mike already record for the same user

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,520
a user exists then we don't do anything

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,230
otherwise we associate that Sushil

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,350
provider account with Drupal

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:01,350
user account and then if you say is not

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:04,890
logged in a first check if there exists

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:07,140
a user record in our social identity if

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,990
yes then we log the log the user login

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,640
the user if no then we check for if an

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,390
email can be obtained from the user if

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,549
yes then we check email address in our

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:20,160
user social identity and get the user ID

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:22,320
and then log is a log Simon otherwise we

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,640
ask a user to fill other details like

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,790
his email and all so and securing the

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,910
access token so earlier the token was

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:35,250
stored in like clean permanent so if a

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,710
website get grease the hack Alexis to

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,270
your all the users access token and he

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,510
could perform any extent of on your

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:45,929
behalf like posting on Facebook etc so

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,870
but during the one of our meeting a

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,330
was there K was there that we need to

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,419
encrypt our token so I used open a cell

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:57,500
encrypt and with a salt defined in

00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,700
settings dot PHP to encrypt a token so

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,410
the salt is unique to every Drupal

00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,990
installation so encryption here is

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,059
actually unique to every Drupal

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,710
installation apart from that in who

00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,929
person open SSL and kept we use an

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,760
initializer initialization vector which

00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:13,799
is a suffix added to encrypted script

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,370
which add some more layer of security

00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:20,160
and here is the image of how normal

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:23,190
encryption decryption works so our data

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,640
is encrypted using a key and the same

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,160
key is required to decrypt the data this

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,809
is like demo of social or Facebook which

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:38,190
I create as well as a part of my cheese

00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:42,330
of course you have to go to the settings

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:44,600
page and all the application ID and app

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:49,230
secret which you can obtain from

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,990
Facebook Developer account so here the

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,630
same and you have to also enter like

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:57,000
your privacy policy or L you can rewrite

00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,500
you can get it from it apart from that

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,799
we have like Advanced Settings so you

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,929
could define what type of data you could

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:07,280
you could collect at when user is

00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,280
authenticating for the first time

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:15,020
and then you need to add a sushi lock

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:17,140
block to your broccoli out which will be

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,140
due

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:36,669
and voila we are done so I'm now anyone

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,889
can use like a social author in their

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,889
website it is like really easy process

00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:54,390
that is it from my side I like thank you

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:57,499
[Applause]

00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,499
[Music]

00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,860
all right thank you very much guys that

00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,230
was great again these are modules that

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,960
are gonna be on lots of Drupal 8 sites

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,929
if you're doing anything with off posts

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,610
social these modules are there they work

00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,440
these students built them and there are

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,090
more it's not just students other people

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,620
have been starting to contribute from

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,549
the community which is one of the

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,889
reasons why we want to do this

00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:25,809
presentation and while we're looking for

00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:28,570
more we need some help with contributing

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:32,169
social posts implementer social off

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,399
implementers the code refactoring do you

00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:36,639
want to mention some yeah there are a

00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:38,590
lot of code that is being that he's been

00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:41,139
using social posts and social out that

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,149
can be go directly into social API and

00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:45,610
that include the a token encryption that

00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:48,760
is being done for social posts but not

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,679
for social oath and we can just use the

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,529
same method and put it in something more

00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:56,260
common like social API and we need help

00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:58,659
with that we also need a commentation

00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,760
the api has has a lot of cool things

00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:03,549
that are not only about logging users in

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,460
you can use the API to do whatever you

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:09,309
want to do with improve services but

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,380
these these these cool features are not

00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:14,769
completely document documented so we

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,600
need help doing that and in general any

00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:21,250
ideas that you have that will be like

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:24,250
very helpful and of course yeah any

00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:26,139
ideas you guys have and you can find us

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,600
if you would like to get involved here's

00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:30,309
some links in the bottom right google

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,049
Summer of Code on giotto groups that

00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:35,260
route blood work that's our main place

00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:39,820
where we are and you can find us we're

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:42,010
also on IRC and Drupal - Google and of

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,360
course it's the code in web site and

00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,820
again

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,210
little refresher the codon is for high

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,549
school students ages 13 to 17

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:54,539
they basically compete to do a bunch of

00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:57,240
small tasks like create that logo or

00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,830
write a small module he's really smart

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,600
he actually wrote like to scroll to top

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,940
module four Drupal 8 some students just

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,460
create logos and stuff for us but they

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,250
compete to want to come to a trip to

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,380
Google and I picked the top two students

00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,730
and they get a full trip to Google for a

00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,500
week with their parents and both of

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,149
these guys have gone on it did you have

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,600
fun going to Google ah yeah it's very

00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:20,700
fun

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,409
it is good yeah okay so the actual

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,529
website for summer of code is Summer of

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:29,130
Code with Google and that is for

00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:30,360
university students you can be a PhD

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,710
student if you want you can be an

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,830
undergrad you can be a master student

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,820
and Google will pay you to contribute to

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,500
open source

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,000
every summer we select about ten

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,519
projects we're actually in the proper

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,220
selection process right now so if you're

00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,010
interested in mentoring it's not a

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,960
full-time gig you it's we put as many

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,039
mentors on projects as possible to help

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,659
these students I mean if we had the

00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,789
possibility of putting ten mentors on a

00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:55,919
project to help these kids just to test

00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:58,350
things review things project management

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,960
type stuff it it all really helps and

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:06,179
that will again run this summer code in

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,440
usually runs in the winter and of course

00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,360
if you'd like to continue this

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,149
discussion with us we have a birds of a

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,330
feather set up so here we are right now

00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:17,970
then there's lunch and at 2:15 in room

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,700
102 a you can come and meet the real

00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,679
live Chuseok students and there will

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,090
probably be some other alumni mentors

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,429
there will be there so you can meet them

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,649
okay or if you want to talk about social

00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:31,830
API or an idea that you have yeah you

00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:34,740
can come there walk home yeah we're

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:37,860
trying to hybrid BOF will we'll be

00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,570
talking about social API Chuseok TCI if

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,980
anybody's interested in any of this and

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,049
wants to get involved come talk to us

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,149
we'd love to meet you if you're

00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:47,909
interested in just testing it or using

00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:50,600
it or contributing it to us we're we're

00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,600
very excited

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,370
alright now we can open it up to

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,200
questions do you guys know the drill you

00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:02,059
gotta come over to the mic and do that

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,059
and get in line here and we'll do that

00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:12,090
so really impressive stuff he is so I've

00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:16,200
mentored through google Summer of Code

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:18,030
before I work at a university we really

00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,870
don't see as much interest in

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,250
participating anymore in the u.s. from

00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:26,010
students like attracting them part of it

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,440
is market forces and what Google pays

00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,630
for that part of it is the availability

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,270
of internships but is there something

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,549
going on in other countries to promote

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:39,059
this program that we're just not doing

00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:42,210
here at US universities second yeah it

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:44,970
is and yeah it is missing a popular due

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,230
to like two of the reasons like lot of

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,510
students are contributing to open source

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,000
apart from that the stipend there is

00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,010
like a bit high compared to on the

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,470
relative scale compared to us

00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:57,690
so in u.s. like sixty six thousand

00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:01,380
dollars might not be much but India like

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:03,390
2 to 400 dollars are like a good amount

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,919
of money any student can earn which is

00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,530
like a much higher to compare to other

00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,720
internships up in India yeah you could

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,470
put it in other perspective Google's

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,690
chuseok students get on average about

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,400
$5,500 per projects if you go to school

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,020
and Stanford and live in Silicon Valley

00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,080
you could probably get a job at a

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,990
start-up for pretty good pay but if you

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,530
live in India $5,500 is couldn't pay for

00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:31,049
almost a year school right yeah so the

00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:34,470
another not related question at all so

00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:37,530
you guys are the league PHP libraries

00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:40,049
are all licenses MIT which is great but

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,730
did you guys run into other libraries

00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:44,669
that you wanted to use in these projects

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,340
that didn't meet with Drupal's kind of

00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:50,190
strict GPL environments we first

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:54,120
analyzed about the hybrid oath which is

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:56,549
like supports more than only of two but

00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,610
the problem was that hybrid out was

00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:01,399
discontinued people were not actively

00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:04,710
maintaining it anymore

00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:08,210
and that was that wasn't alternative we

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,730
also consider thing was from symphony

00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,279
there's like a symphony social but we

00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:17,039
decided to use PHP the league because is

00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:19,109
it's a more active community and they

00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,770
are actually doing very cool stuff and

00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:25,429
they are more popular than the symphony

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:29,099
social developed initially I think

00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:30,809
that's doesn't reason which we chose the

00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,119
leek over the other ones so like

00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:36,419
Facebook's default license out PHP is

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,159
Apache to which we can use so a lot of

00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:40,679
projects can only be installed via

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,329
composer and even then what you the

00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,549
result in code that you end up with is

00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,429
only GPL 3 compatible you guys didn't

00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:50,010
run into that at all with all of these

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,929
are you talking about the official

00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:56,849
library from Facebook like Facebook's

00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:59,039
sdk library well initially we were using

00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:02,160
social we were using for version one

00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,619
point necks we were using the default

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,500
library from Facebook because you can

00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,779
basically is whatever library you want

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,640
but then since we migrated to the lick

00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:13,049
both - we decided to just use the

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,529
official implementer from the league

00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:20,460
instead of using the SDK from Facebook

00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:24,240
okay this is a question from the other

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,430
side a lot of the work that I do with my

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,930
clients requires me to grab data from

00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,539
Facebook and Twitter and pull it onto

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,010
the website do you guys have plans to

00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:34,890
implement that piece of the

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:37,680
functionality - yeah currently in

00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,660
advancement but in that ban settings you

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,970
can set up which is calls do you wanna

00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,010
get from join a request during the

00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,710
authentication and then you can also set

00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,630
up some Sun endpoints that you want to

00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:52,770
request for instance the user friendlies

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:55,319
and those dot those endpoints are stored

00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,180
in the database however you need to do

00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,099
more complicated requests you can use

00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,920
the API itself and write your own code

00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,559
or you can write your own customized

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,809
module to retrieve all this data and put

00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,359
it on your website so you can do all of

00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:13,890
these if you want what we wanted to do

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,050
was to give developers like they a call

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,130
just start with so they can request data

00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,960
and authenticate

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,350
but you can do whatever you want to do

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,520
with with with the API gotcha so the the

00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,700
core of functionality doesn't have any

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,650
plans to grab for example posts or

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,930
tweets and pull them back and store them

00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:33,120
as entities you can you can actually

00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,610
pull data right now in store in the

00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,920
database but you will have to write a

00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,390
custom module to actually retrieve it

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,940
from the database and show it as you

00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:45,000
want there are ideas going on about like

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:47,490
giving and do I need to actually display

00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,770
the data as you want yeah but we haven't

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,810
developers yet gotcha okay thank you

00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,640
yeah and that's kind of one things I

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,920
would like to see too is more management

00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,560
on this on what happens when you start

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,720
authenticating with multiple providers

00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,190
and say how do you select which avatar

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,780
pulls in you know you have LinkedIn

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,520
Facebook all that and you should there

LinkedIn I want my this picture and then

00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,700

00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,690
path we'd love some help on it and of

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,340
course we have another Summer of Code

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,260
coming up we'll get more done in the

00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:25,950

questions

00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,550

00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:37,950

00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:39,780
social API on drupal.org here you go and

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,240

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,160
social off the social post and you know

00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,350
figure out what they're for and

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,090
different modules different pages and

00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,620
check it out go to drupal.org these

00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,060
students have written wonderful

00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,710
documentation on how to do that you guys

00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,600
have even created some videos on how to

00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:01,290
do a lot of this and again the

00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:07,170
documentation is so good I was how old

00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:10,140
is masking 1516 maaske was 15 when he's

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,640
developed the first he's implementer so

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,320
I mean high school students can follow

00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,360
what these kids have done and write a

00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,980
little bit of code

00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,750
our contributing modules to drupal.org

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,430
and for a lot of people who are new to

00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,260
Drupal or want to contribute more that

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,230
the contribution stuff seems a bit

00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,580
daunting but it this is evidence that it

00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,020
really isn't if you just kind of look

00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,370
and read the documentation and follow

00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:33,130
along the steps are there and anybody

00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:38,060
can get involved any final words guys I

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:41,090
don't have anything else to do I just

00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,590
