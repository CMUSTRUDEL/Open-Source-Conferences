Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: JavaScript and Accessibility: Don't Blame the Language
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	There is a long-held belief among developers that any application built using JavaScript is necessarily not accessible. This belief is reinforced by the rapid adoption of JavaScript frameworks and UI components that are immature, and by the corners that get cut when time to market takes priority over inclusivity.

But JavaScript is not to blame!

As a completely blind JavaScript developer, I can state with some certainty that JavaScript is not to blame. That long-held belief is, in fact, a misbelief. There are, however, a few things you need to know when building client-side applications with JavaScript, to ensure that your applications are universally accessible.

What you will learn:

Where the belief that JavaScript is inaccessible came from
Why the use of JavaScript easily leads to inaccessible applications
What are the most common causes of inaccessible JavaScript applications
How the use of modern frameworks like React can make JavaScript accessibility easy

welcome to DrupalCon this session is

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,820
JavaScript and accessibility don't blame

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,519
zevran zu felt did to be presented here

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,349
again as well presentation I'm blind

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,360
I'm gonna have this earbud in my ear

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,310
during the presentation just to let I

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,170
can listen to my notes one of my

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,119
colleagues Lee in the front row hears

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:26,130
driving the slides and she'll try to

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,710
keep up with me as I'm doing so thanks

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,689
once again everybody for coming before

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,270
we jump into the session I want to

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,730
really just start by saying really this

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:41,280
session revolves around a clear thesis

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,870
and like any theses I'm certain any good

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,940
thesis I'm certain that there are people

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,000
in this community and perhaps even in

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,520
the room that might disagree or disagree

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,590
strongly with the thesis and that's

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,230
important because it's only through

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,329
sharing ideas and agreeing and

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,160
disagreeing and combating back and forth

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,440
around those points that we learn and

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,359
that we grow as a community so before I

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,820
dig into the details I'll kind of do the

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,990
spoiler alert here's the thesis that I'm

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:13,080
here to share javascript is not to blame

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,909
for accessibility there might be good

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,520
reasons not to use JavaScript in your

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,900
application there might be good reasons

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,350
to use JavaScript and to build using

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,990
progressive enhancement accessibility

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,950
for persons with disabilities who use

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,799
modern technologies is not one of those

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,299
good reasons so if in your mind today if

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,659
you've come to this session and you're

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,490
asking am I allowed to use JavaScript

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,270
doesn't JavaScript create problems for

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:50,640
accessibility my thesis is the answer is

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,409
no so Who am I my name is Everett zu

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,299
felt I'm the director of technology at

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,649
my planet I've been working at my planet

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,659
for just about six years now I started

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,520
speaking at Drupal con in San Francisco

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,829
in 2010 I gave a quick five minute

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,649
lightning talk on accessibility during

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,690
the core the core track which I think at

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,400
that time was one day in advance of

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,050
Drupal con it wasn't a track like it is

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,570
now running through the entire car

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,400
prince i was the accessibility

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,410
maintainer for drupal seven i've

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,740
participated in the HTML working group

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,750
at the w3c and right now what i'm doing

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,880
at my planet is i'm supporting a growing

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,160
team of technologists who use drupal and

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,010
react and other open-source technologies

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,760
in order to build cool solutions for our

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,620
customers some of the things we're going

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
to cover today i want to go over this in

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,980
advance that you can decide if you're in

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,240
the right session

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,510
imagine if i'm gonna give a little bit

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,620
of a background on myself and and

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,180
explain some of the barriers that I

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,850
personally have run into with

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,140
accessibility on the web we're going to

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,510
talk about a few myths about

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,270
accessibility let me talk about the

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,640
truth about accessibility we're gonna

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,560
talk about affordances and for any

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,270
designers in the room that term probably

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,370
resonates but for people who are maybe

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,200
less familiar with interface design

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,490
we'll do a bit of a refresher around

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,190
what an affordance is and why

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,130
affordances are important we'll talk

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,530
about JavaScript and its role on the web

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:19,170
we'll talk about how browsers take

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,450
information from HTML and the Dom and

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,959
map that into something that assistive

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,610
technologies can make use of we're gonna

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,390
talk about the div problem and how we

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,550
fix it we're going to talk about some

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,310
complexities you know outside of maybe

00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,040
some more I'll use the word monolithic

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,350
but outside of applications that we

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,239
might be familiar with where each page

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,980
of content is a single request and

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,930
response from the server we'll talk

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,110
about things that are more application

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,170
like or single page apps and where some

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:55,500
additional complexities around

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,450
accessibility emerge we'll talk about

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,600
some complex user interface components

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,250
things that don't exist in the html5

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,050
specification so that we need to go out

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,730
of our way to write even more in

00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,570
javascript in order to make those items

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,160
accessible and we'll talk about what we

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:16,650
can all be doing next in order to

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:19,140
progress accessibility on the web so a

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,850
little bit of a background on me I was

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,860
born with the degenerative eye disease I

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,650
was born with glaucoma but it's called

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,030
congenital glaucoma most people the vast

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,520
majority of people who

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,980
kkoma get glaucoma later on in life

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,680
either as complication from heart

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,830
disease or diabetes I was born with

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,360
glaucoma it's a progressive eye disease

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,770
there's not really you can slow it down

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,930
but there's not a lot you can do about

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,940
it so from a young age I knew that it

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,860
was highly likely that at some point

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,639
during my adult life I would lose my

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,430
sight

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,270
I learned web development in the late

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,010
90s so let's talk like 96 97 98 where

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,750
you were writing you know one page for

00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,160
Netscape one page for Internet Explorer

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,470
and then sometimes two different pages

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,760
for two different versions of Netscape

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,820
two different pages for two different

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,640
versions of Internet Explorer as around

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,910
2004 that I completely lost my remaining

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,080
vision and I'd say it's probably been I

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,460
was trying to answer this question for

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,590
myself earlier today it's probably been

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,460
about 15 years that I've been working

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,740
with assistive technology situations

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,419
that have happened to me

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,450
you've referred to a popular social

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:28,860
media platform and it was impossible to

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,690
register just something about that

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,320
registration form you weren't able to

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:37,440
register imagine a popular online

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,780
shopping site you know you're 30 40

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,470
minutes by it's completely impossible to

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,750
check out of the store imagine if you

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,560
log into an application for your job

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,210
maybe it's an HR application and you

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,130
your your colleagues are telling you

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,289
yeah just go push the request time off

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,060
button or whatever other task you're

00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:00,919
trying to complete and those buttons

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,850
don't exist for you in the application

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,910
imagine if you're trying to book a hotel

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:10,169
room or a flight and you just no matter

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,000
what you do cannot enter the check-in

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,750
date or the departure date that you're

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,039
that you're trying to use imagine if

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,850
you're working with a software delivery

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,890
team like I assume many of us do and you

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,260
want to contribute to planning with the

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,600
team but the but the task management

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,360
tool your team uses makes it impossible

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,460
for you to move items around the board

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,169
group them into sprints or prioritize

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,790
them with your group so these are all

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,919
experiences that I've had

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,020
whether in my personal life or my work

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,150
in life barriers that I've run into

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,130
because of my disability and because of

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,280
the assistive technology I use but

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,650
moreover because what I will assume to

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,380
be very well-intentioned web developers

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,570
didn't have enough understanding of how

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,820
accessibility works on the web to be

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,930
able to make those interfaces accessible

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,330
abilities don't use my web application

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,280
years ago I was doing a bit of an

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,040
introduction to accessibility at Ryerson

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,360
College in Toronto and they asked one of

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,550
the scoot one of the students said well

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,810
I'm building a I'm building an online

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,400
store that sells art so clearly that

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,810
doesn't need to be accessibility to

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:29,550
people who are accessible to people who

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:31,560
are blind screenreader users yep so the

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:37,560
screen readers obviously they can't use

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:41,340
JavaScript accessibility that's only a

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:45,270
half myth I'll let you figure out for

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,190
yourself which parts the myth I'll go

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,610
I'll make a bold statement here that if

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:53,130
if the if the goal of being a goddess

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,630
possible audience of users then

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:59,970
excellently and important well you know

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,229
we've never tested it second to last one

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,380
is illy

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:07,910
in the United States nobody in my

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,410
industry has been taken to court and

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,780
over the last couple of years there's

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:17,750
been a VA against retailers and other

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:21,630
businesses across America universities

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:26,370
retail business grocery stores athletics

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:28,050
companies absolutely unless you're in a

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,380
very niche industry somebody in your

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,310
business has been taken to court molasse

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,330
myth javascript is not accessible and

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,330
quite clearly it is

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,010
I've got a bit of a quote up there and

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,840
have you I'm not sure if you can see but

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:52,490
if you take a look there those quotes

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:56,280
from WCAG 1.0 where we're on 2.1 now and

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,900
20 years ago the recommendation was make

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:04,500
sure that the pages work when scripts

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:06,660
applets everybody remember applets and

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,780
other programmatic objects are turned

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,610
off because those poor folks with

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,670
disabilities can't use those types of

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,860
tools and they they couldn't this wasn't

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,170
wrong this wasn't a wrong recommendation

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,340
and it wasn't a wrong approach but this

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:25,650
was 20 years ago I could still see when

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,170
this was a recommendation I was just

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,600
barely learning how CSS and HTML all

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,720
worked together back in the late 90s to

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,820
build website this is no confusion has

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,600
come from because many many years that

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:43,440
and we all did this or for the purposes

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,840
of accessibility some truths about

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,560
accessibility accessibility is a human

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,720
right under the United Nations Charter

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:56,300
for the rights of persons and on the the

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,610
totally skewed toward ability it did

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,770
might interfere with your work thank you

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,050
easy thing to start that's absolutely

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:07,590
specific domain knowledge that's why I'm

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:10,580
here sharing with you today doing is

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:13,860
better is going to make your application

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:17,460
pull from about a year ago less than

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:21,570
seven about JavaScript accessibility so

00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:29,280
I know you're in good company with 75%

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:30,900
of your peers so why are why did I want

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,780
to talk about affordances here when

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,120
we're talking about JavaScript so you

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,010
know although JavaScript can be used

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,960
server side using solutions like node

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:45,300
the the aspect or the usage of

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,790
JavaScript that has done accessibility

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,210
by far it's used in the browser the user

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,980
experience and to add interactivity

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,970
where interactivity does

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,220
exist natively in HTML and when we're

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,040
talking about interactivity and we're

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:06,110
talking about user interface design we

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:10,740
just miss by necessity we're talking

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:13,589
with the term the ability for us Leon

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,660
the web its purpose of an object when we

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,550
don't have access to that object I can't

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,949
touch it I can't feel it

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,649
I can't visual language we use in

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:26,459
patterns so that you can believe

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:28,199
drop-down menu as it has to do listen to

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,000
four dances these are easy but that's

00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,290
interactive and that if you click it

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,880
something will happen you don't know

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,050
what's going to happen but you know

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,160
something's going to happen when you

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,110
click on that link pattern is on a

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,089
website with a an arrow pointing

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,639
downward or perhaps a mirror see that

00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:48,089
and if that arrow is close enough to the

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,829
word of the phrase you infer that

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,540
there's some amount of interactivity

00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:56,790
that when you click on that word or

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,100
phrase it's going to expand hidden

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:04,639
affordances these ones become a little

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:07,380
bit more tricky hidden affordances

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,899
aren't revealed until somebody has done

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,130
something this might be the little

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:16,920
question mark beside formfield element

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,870
and you've learned over the years of

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,000
interacting on the web that if you hover

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,339
over top of or click on that little

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,100
question mark some more informations

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,350
going to appeal negative a for submit

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,870
button and it's there's a level of

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,990
opacity applied to it it looks like it's

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:38,250
it looks like it's been disabled well

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,720
that's an affordance as well and most of

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,019
these affordances and most of the

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,250
behaviors that we're talking here

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,440
perhaps with the exception of that last

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,930
one but even but even with the last one

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,810
most of these affordances the behavior

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,990
behind them is JavaScript so we're using

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,620
CSS yes to visually represent the

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,230
affordance

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:03,240
but we're using interactivity quite

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,430
simply it allows you to create dynamic

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,209
content on the web it allows us to do

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,980
more than

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:13,290
a document that allows us to engage our

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,509
users through a level of intruder then

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:23,629
clicking on a link in loading the next

00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:28,980
page of content into basic for some of

00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:32,579
browsers and the Dom is not HTML and

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,089
with HTML and Dom very very different

00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,369
things

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:38,369
how's a markup language it was pulled

00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:41,160
embed images what it is is a text file

00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:44,939
it's people and can be rendered in a

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:50,639
browser Anna rains once more importantly

00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:53,059
nowaday use some is complying or a very

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,939
minimally underlying source document

00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:59,459
that loads JavaScript the JavaScript

00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:02,610
creates all of the Dom elements whether

00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:05,459
you using react or ember or angular just

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,889
using jQuery straight up on its own all

00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:10,740
of the items all the elements in the Dom

00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,240
are created by JavaScript and some of

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,420
that content is embedded in the

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,910
JavaScript sometimes that content is

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,949
retrieved through through a callback to

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,499
a web server the last couple of years

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,139
we've Drupal but there might actually be

00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:27,749
in your application

00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:30,869
very minimal HTML there might be only

00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:33,480
enough HTML to load the JavaScript on

00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:39,209
the page that that works as the basis of

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:41,999
that single page application is source

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:45,439
document that with HTML into a document

00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:49,999
object model to model and turns it into

00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:53,490
or exposes it as an accessibility API

00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:57,480
and it's that API that and it's

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:04,499
different I never died that - both - in

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:11,069
terms of active element are a sea of

00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:13,379
divs and spans so plea when I'm not

00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:16,660
hearing divs and span but I'm really

00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:20,120
getting no is

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,850
Emperor common complex from scratch

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,560
rather than just using a plugin you know

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,500
how many considerations need to go

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,760
holding a calendar on the web and all I

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,380
hear one six seven there's nothing that

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,860
indicates to me that there's nothing

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:40,160
that indicated the year or what year

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,390
it's just this sea of numbers on the

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,380
page now you learn about you people but

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,959
ecology doesn't tell us that it's a

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,480
linker I've learned that that's probably

00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,970
about that's probably raft to the word

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,230
save in a diverse pan and they added a

00:15:52,970 --> 00:16:01,490
click that div or span s indeed if I

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:05,690
simulated my verts it will save what it

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:08,899
is I'm working on buttons I'm gonna go

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:13,010
be bold here and say you excused for

00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:15,079
buttons therein to eat Islanders first

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:20,269
thing drop is we've been using in

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:22,790
popular culture most common opponents to

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,740
build and you don't really miners you

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,800
don't really have a lot of evidence on

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:32,360
how to do it properly than a div and you

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:37,100
put a and button L but a calendar you to

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:41,750
build and and so that's why a few yes

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:46,010
specification and three C got together

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:49,490
and said that may be gritty being used

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:52,940
on the a but that don't HTML together

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:57,980
and they they define which around Oh

00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:03,370
with role if that you can now add Dom

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:06,880
will equal to a in the excessive where

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,880
there's a few I'm

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:14,850
of having these area documents Aria is

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,650
now the age stirs didn't make you the

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,720
aged only thing five do which is not

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,660
document anymore web applications were

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,680
you what the API is being created by

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:33,960
style things and to add behavior

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:36,930
plication look around this what I type

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:42,390
in all the search results pay because my

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:46,530
screen readers what was I here so now as

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:49,860
a is on that page is there here for my

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:54,270
screen actual afford it in the same if

00:17:49,860 --> 00:18:01,400
you other customers using a visual the

00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:09,960
next departure result sorted is lowest

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:13,820
it's an indicator to mean hey the

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:18,090
concept sometimes they're all to a

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:23,430
national on Thursday do when I get on to

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:29,370
that XP indicates to you something

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:31,880
spring on faces travel or otherwise kind

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,750
of leave the assistive technology aspect

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,660
alerts you don't really know what's

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,780
happening do I have to go literally I

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,190
have no idea

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:49,950
it's thing I hear on the Expedia site

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:55,230
after I for non-stop reads filtering and

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:59,669
a moment later it says filtered

00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:06,389
I the Expedia has done an excellent job

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:11,100
at what is actually a fair one level to

00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:18,769
communicate visual afford and filtering

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:21,240
on data and the readiness of and budget

00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:24,480
with all statements about what's

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:30,690
happening people can see happening in

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:36,000
the browser a frustrating or experience

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:42,659
for me and turn that is actually quite

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:51,139
delight do these things on Expedia on

00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:55,919
your own I have I'm doing live demos of

00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:59,279
conferences the reality types of rooms

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,750
are not really amenable to having

00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:07,380
somebody who has never heard who's only

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:11,460
seldom listened to hear it here at

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:15,029
Talking echoey room you just you just

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:18,539
don't but if you were to go and check

00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:24,289
that after those results and then if you

00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:28,649
open the bottom of the Dom you asked

00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:32,669
message that would be sitting there

00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:36,980
aztec text at the bottom of the DOM

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:39,539
and how that works is using something

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:43,350
regions so we talked about Aria is

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:46,230
accessible we talked about the fact that

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:49,799
there's do and so for a lot of these

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:53,639
more components that we want to be

00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:57,690
adding to our web page that are

00:20:53,639 --> 00:21:01,349
create a broad own in our it's not

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:07,639
really a component person this concept

00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:07,639
of a live region region is really simple

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:21,830
that you mark up Xing using the Aria

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:21,830
states and when new dom nodes are at

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:35,910
technology no to read that they they

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:39,600
monitor it in the DOM and they announce

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:42,970
now there's some politeness set

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,930
typically they range from kind of if

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:49,170
this is very very important if you

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:54,460
happening you can set it on the more

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:57,180
term if it's lesson just ticker that

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:02,320
scrolling though I would encourage

00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:05,800
ticker automatically on a webpage if

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,210
it's something less important so on the

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,880
more polite end of the spectrum and that

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:27,230
all whether or not the screen being read

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:29,620
in ordered components

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:35,480
I've talked about a little bit here

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:38,570
again I'm over the speaker system

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,809
because I don't get anything out of it

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:45,230
but I'd be happy the people who want to

00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:51,070
learn more afterward a private demo

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:55,970
later on during one of the things that I

00:22:51,070 --> 00:23:00,049
will have demoed here I've said and I

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:03,020
know it's probably hard to for the 15 to

00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:06,290
20 years and use on the web we still

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:10,520
don't really have a great web sites and

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:13,940
this is where I get to create a little

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:18,380
bit of conflict cuz on Nashville website

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:24,140
at site before it and I would guess the

00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:29,620
room or that has a fairly down menu and

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:35,210
so my colleague who's dry demonstrate

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:39,679
this menus not terrible at least tab

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:42,620
through menu items and acts list them

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,730
with a key couldn't use a pointing

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,760
device only able to navigate through web

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,700
page you can at least navigate through

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,970
those top-level there on one of them and

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,380
go to the page but what I'll see there

00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:02,630
and if you do it on your own and your

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:07,100
brain should be able to see is that new

00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:09,940
items receives focused new items beneath

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,940
it do expand

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:19,520
but it's impossible to get so if you

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:24,690
want well which is underneath program

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:28,830
and a way to get to the schedule go down

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:33,980
there's no stuff submenu items there's

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:36,540
no way to get and almost every web

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:41,390
variation of this sort of drop-down menu

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:45,080
or complex with multiple columns or

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:50,580
advertising content on the right hands

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:53,790
it actually isn't a tough thing to make

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:56,550
access morrow afternoon my colleague

00:24:53,790 --> 00:25:00,030
Laura and I are good best ability

00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:03,600
testing and we'll talk this pattern

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:09,140
actually is so complex not readily

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,650
tested by out four but suffice it to say

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:19,820
even on the Drupal con website and

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:19,820
gather the website but it's quite right

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:26,040
in reader how would I use that menu I

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:29,160
would I did yesterday cuz I was looking

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:33,030
up this guy and find the link for

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:38,640
program use a keyboard command on my

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:42,390
keyboard he Mouse to where Mike and I've

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,990
actually moved the mouse over which

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,820
expands the drop-down look continue

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:54,540
pressing the down arrow and my keyboard

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:59,940
and I want screenreader user knows how

00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:02,529
to do all plex set of interaction of

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:07,190
menu item

00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:10,640
we won't demo this one but mass.gov a la

00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:15,110
I think the mass.gov team full of

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:18,230
research into what mate and on their

00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:21,890
site you are able so if you were to

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:25,700
again try this afterward able to move

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:29,510
across the top level items sure you can

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,960
choose whether or not you to submenus or

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:36,679
whether or not moving across the top of

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:43,730
the top level a pattern for making this

00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:47,299
successful complex user interface

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:51,010
component very last accessibility

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:54,320
enhancements we and many years ago is

00:26:51,010 --> 00:27:00,860
autocomplete have an interpolate the

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:06,190
autocomplete field is if you start

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,190
typing in a destination like that Sh

00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:11,960
user so there's gonna be a visual

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,900
affordance is some indication that

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,900
there's a number of look search between

00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:25,730
user you have no idea that the pop-up a

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:28,970
lot I use hotels.com a lot it's a few

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,410
letters of a city name and that I'll

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:36,830
probably they'll probably be an

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:40,820
autocomplete on the other it does once

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:43,850
again I said I said with that using

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:48,110
those live read the data and I think

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:51,950
Expedia does a terrific lead as well so

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:56,710
with X starting to type in na SH for an

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,710
it but I hear red in my screen reader

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:08,929
ten suggestions being its use the air

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:11,900
list so really the exact same

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:16,309
information perhaps he's just looking at

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:20,330
the screen I'm being told I'm being told

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:23,330
how to enter I'm even being told that

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:26,480
there when you'd have to count the list

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,740
if I know that for more information than

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:38,330
somebody who can see so I think that

00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:43,760
Expedia is done the last one that I'd

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:47,690
like is calendar I talked about hard to

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,320
do it's hard to do or they can type in a

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:58,549
date though Frank and using a lot of

00:28:51,320 --> 00:29:00,700
American websites I feel I just do it

00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:06,169
both ways and hope for that one of them

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:10,160
on arrow plan is loyalty program for the

00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:15,530
time being and up until a couple of

00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:16,360
months ago impossible and I that hey

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,809
I've been

00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,260
with the web a long time ripped I can

00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:26,710
even open up the dev and to make the

00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:30,130
page more accessible to my to remediate

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:34,600
my own accessibility bill a couple of

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:40,780
months ago it was he to type a date into

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:44,470
the flood the date field it so if you

00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:47,890
were to try to type the date man you

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:52,270
could search top to bottom of a calendar

00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:58,990
it was impossible that slightly but what

00:29:52,270 --> 00:30:02,200
I'd like to come for an example so

00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:05,559
whether it's Hilton horn these Suites or

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:10,419
any of the Hilton brands if you wish

00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:14,410
there wait to with the as with a screen

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,929
reader we knew eight field not only can

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:23,200
you yourself if you know the right

00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:26,820
format loud and I think that much

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,820
information but I mean let's air

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:38,910
the down arrow will move you into the

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:44,230
cap where you can use the arrow keys to

00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:48,520
enter key to make your selection scape

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:52,720
to leave the date picker want to enter

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:55,300
the date manually by using a screen not

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,290
only does it 8 through the calendar

00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:01,480
yield but it gives that there it

00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:03,790
let me how to move around the kills me

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,000
how to select a date dismiss the

00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:10,410
calendar I don't like using the is an

00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
excellent example of an excess I

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:19,390
normally ask Thursday afternoon if you'd

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,870
like to come up that we can chat and I

00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:25,840
can give you a want me to take a look at

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:31,690
one of the app I can take up ages and

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:36,690
like things look really big take home is

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:40,510
that job not to blame ample from Hilton

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:45,550
possible without Java when I click on

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:48,880
the box to filter my connections idiot

00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:51,490
tip and is implying the filter than a

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:57,400
few mo the filters been applied

00:31:51,490 --> 00:32:03,040
that's not of a script take those down

00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:06,280
menus amass gov keyboard only and so you

00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:12,240
can navigate through the service the

00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:19,920
government can't properly without Jeff

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:24,430
is not to blame so working together

00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,210
this is help so if we thinking about

00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:30,400
ever you think oh I've got this blog

00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:33,940
filtered it's when the film this date

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:38,410
component I know that's not a cuz I just

00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:41,650
grabbed the I found what

00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:44,930
and that you're doing is better than

00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:49,940
easy and you accessible than it was

00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:55,760
yesterday using the live region but with

00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:59,800
the does sound like a lot so when the

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,240
spackle frameworks community accessible

00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,430
accessibility I know that my colleague

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,450
that is a group of people he sometimes

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:13,010
some great so around how to buildings

00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:17,410
there's lots but there who've gone

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,410
