Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: National Audubon Society & Drupal: Data Visualization for a Better World
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Data is an important driver for numerous business and technical decisions, but making sense of it can be difficult. How do you bring complicated data from the world of statistics into the visual language of the 21st century?

In this session, the National Audubon Society and FFW will discuss our solution for gathering static, tabular information, and displaying it in Drupal in intuitive charts and maps. This session places a special focus on how data visualization is furthering The National Audubon Society’s mission of preserving valuable and critical natural resources and species.

Session attendees will learn about a blend of business, design, and technical strategies for data visualization. We’ll showcase how Drupal can be used to display huge amounts of dense data in a way that allows the average user to easily manipulate, filter, and intuitively interact with that complex information.

This 60-minute session is divided into three sections:



A breakdown of the business problems we experienced around unifying data that was previously buried in indecipherable charts on numerous conservation data source websites. We’ll discuss some of the challenges around deriving insights from such fragmented data, and how the new approach to data visualization has lead to direct improvements in user engagement and fundraising activities.

A detailed explanation of how The National Audubon Society and FFW designed a user-friendly way to share information about conservation efforts. We’ll talk about the user experience considerations around intuitively displaying complicated conservation data on landscapes and species, and how we put precise control of the data in the hands of the user – in a very tactile and intuitive way.

An overview of the technologies that underpin The National Audubon Society’s new data visualization displays. We’ll share how our mapping softwares and API integrations work with Drupal 7, and will answer questions on the technical challenges that we faced in creating this solution.


Who should come to this session?

We encourage people of all levels of Drupal expertise to attend this session, which will focus on the business, strategic, and marketing considerations of being able to visualize data in real time.

terrific well my name is Morgan Curran

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,240
I work for ffw I'm here from Cambridge

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,210
Massachusetts today so really happy to

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,020
be in Nashville I'm joined by my client

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,190
and partner mr. Greg Brutus from

00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,869
National Audubon Society and we're

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,920
really excited to be here with you today

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,970
we're looking forward to sharing a

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,250
project that we have been working on

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,960
together over the last six to nine

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,660
months and that we're continually

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,170
working on but essentially it's data

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,290
visualization for a better world

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:40,649
National Audubon Society ffw and Drupal

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,390
so we've had a fantastic time over the

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,010
last six months working on this

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,200
engagement and we wanted to share it

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,030
with you so before we dive in and a

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,500
little bit about the team Greg why don't

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,340
you come on up here and talk a little

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,190
bit about your history thanks Morgan

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,910
I'm Greg viridis I'm a data scientist

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,640
and design technologist and what that

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,540
means is my backgrounds in geography I

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,010
like to make maps and other tools to

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:15,600
visualize and communicate data to

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,670
diverse audiences my name is Morgan

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
Curran as I said I work for ffw in

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,490
Cambridge Massachusetts

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,580
my background is in user experience

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,530
design and when I started out in design

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,810
there was no user experience there was

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,479
no digital so I'm sort of aging myself a

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,490
little bit there but over the last 15

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,799
years or so I've worked exclusively in

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,439
digital experience design starting out

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,119
with large agencies I work for Digitas

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,780
for a long long time and then more

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,500
recently with children's k-12 education

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,930
houghton mifflin harcourt working on

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,970
helping them transform from a book

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,570
publishing company to a digital learning

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,549
company with distributed content so that

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,360
work actually prepared me very well for

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,250
the engagement here at ffw with Greg and

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,680
the Audubon team because we worked a lot

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,210
on maps and visualizing data for

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,770
children and making it so that they

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,660
could easily understand what they were

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,480
looking at without having to have it be

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,380
interpreted for them

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,440
additionally here as with all things

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,680
Drupal Greg and I are on stage but

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,210
Juwanna ground was is not here today but

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,300
was very much part of the project as

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,890
were these folks right here and many

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,670
others as well so Greg and I are telling

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:33,810
the story but really it was a large

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,490
distributed team effort okay so before

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,930
we dive in we're gonna talk to you a

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,950
little bit about Autobahn you may have

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,440
heard at the National Audubon Society

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,360
we're gonna talk a little bit about if

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,650
and how it came to be we're going to

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,380
give you some background on this

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,300
engagement and why the Audubon Society

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,430
was looking for a conservation tracker

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,380
we're gonna talk you through our project

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,800
process as we went through discovery

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,750
design development and then launch and

00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,760
then we're gonna demo the product in its

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,050
current state it's continually evolving

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,690
but we're gonna share it with you as it

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,040
exists today once we've done that we'll

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,830
talk a little bit about the technology

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,390
and the data layers that underpin it and

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,260
support it and then finally we're going

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,630
to talk to you a little bit about

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,790
lessons learned and the things that

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,810
we're going to do moving forwards to

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:22,110
continually improve it makes sense cool

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,180
okay so over to Greg thanks Morgan

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,220
so I represent National Audubon Society

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,959
and some of you might be wondering what

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,010
that is the group began around the early

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,900
1900s

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,240
and it's the oldest such organization

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,980
that blends science and education for

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,350
the purpose of conservation and in our

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,580
case it's avian conservation birds

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,230
what's really powerful about the

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,660
autobahn network is that it's mostly

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,920
volunteer driven so I was able to attend

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,900
our biannual convention this year and

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,420
you have volunteers members from our

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,790
different chapters who are doctors

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,560
lawyers and other professions by day and

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,050
then they spend their free time and

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,239
sometimes even their money on supporting

00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,510
bird conservation because they're avid

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,630
birders or they just really care about

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,160
the species in general the network also

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,020
has these sanctuaries and centers which

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,880
are like these scientific research nodes

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:22,680
on the ground local work to advance the

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,440
mission and then national and state

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,570
offices which I'm part of but you see

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,970
this picture here of some fashionistas

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,470
and I the origin of Audubon is actually

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,890
a very interesting story and I'll try to

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,310
tell it well these feather hats there

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,020
was a frenzy in the early 1900's people

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,240
murdering up to five million birds a

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:47,630
year to create these plumage these hats

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,979
and in the early 1900's we saw women

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,200
conservationists mostly based in Florida

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:55,740
coming to the forefront and basically

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,150
saying this is not right and so it was

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,850
the first time a popular movement

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,039
coalesced around the defense of the

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,410
environment and not surprisingly in this

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,020
case it was to save birds so how did we

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,870
fast forward a hundred years how do we

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,450
go from this early beginnings to a

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,539
high-tech leading-edge science-based

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:19,020
conservation organization which is what

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:20,580
I would classify us is now Audubon is

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,960
unique in that it has this powerful

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,630
network as I mentioned sort of these

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,200
three tiers national state and local but

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,760
really to be honest the local piece is

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,780
what drives the group because it's

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,370
volunteer based and so much more some of

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,940
you may have heard of the Christmas Bird

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,490
Count

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,100
the CBC it's a the oldest running

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,400
community science program in the world

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,289
people have been going out after

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,460
Christmas to their backyards and in

00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:52,800
their neighborhoods and counting birds

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,300
but if you break down Audubon and many

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,130
other conservation environmental

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,990
conservation organizations they're

00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,310
really pretty similar and you might have

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,440
heard of groups like the World Wildlife

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,599
Fund and the Nature Conservancy very

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,280
similar missions but the one thing I've

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,620
learned and having worked with a few of

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,780
them is that they all operate under

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,460
slightly different currencies and as you

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,140
might imagine the currency with Audubon

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,140
is birds and their habitats

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:22,080
interestingly probably the most cutting

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,729
edge or kind of new program that I'd

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,130
like to share a quick story about is our

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,350
climate watch program and climate watch

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,780
what it really tries to do is just move

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,180
beyond the issue of politics when

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,970
talking about climate change and instead

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,449
trying to let Birds tell the story of

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:42,090
how climate change is effect

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:43,949
birds and the environment so many

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,590
Audubon members like I mentioned are

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,659
from traditionally red states and so

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,659
bringing up the topic of climate change

00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:54,300
is not generally recommended so what we

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:56,310
do is we say you are members you care

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,629
about Birds go out to your backyard go

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,210
out to your neighborhood park and tell

00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,310
us are you seeing the same birds you've

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,069
been seeing over the last 10 50 hundred

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,930
years and let the birds tell that story

00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,610
and validate some of our scientific

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,340
models and other tools that we're using

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,590
to understand this so they go out maybe

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,300
they see new species that they never had

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,430
before because these birds are

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,710
colonizing areas that traditionally they

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,090
hadn't or maybe something that they're

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,430
used to seeing a bird that they're used

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,930
to seeing is disappearing and we can we

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,229
can tell that story and we can share

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,979
with other people in a very you know

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:33,360
agnostic sort of a political way and

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,490
then not to belabor this point but just

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,879
the network being very powerful very

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,610
adaptive and volunteer-driven allows us

00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,050
to do a lot of things that other

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,020
organizations won't including investing

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,719
in technology and what we're about to

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,819
show you today so that's why I believe

00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,830
Audubon is unique and now sort of the

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,930
ask the reason why we started this

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:59,460
project which we call the conservation

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:01,680
tracker my boss's boss autobahns chief

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,889
conservation officer asked a very

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,009
fundamental basic question to the

00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:10,139
organization it was how are we doing you

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,849
know what are our vitals are we are we

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,509
actually having an impact are we moving

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,180
the needle

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,490
are we just spending donor and

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,710
foundation dollars on this mission that

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,419
is not having any result and that's

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,039
actually a really difficult question to

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:27,899
answer when you're talking about

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,490
science-based work and an advocacy so we

00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,620
knew pretty quickly who our audience was

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,339
we wanted to be accountable to our

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,019
funders and our board but the purpose

00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:39,990
evolved over time and we started to see

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:42,409
some challenges because the autobahn

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,820
network is so broad as I've mentioned

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,459
there's really no centralized data

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,110
management no authoritative data that we

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,030
could draw upon everybody had their own

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,070
orphan Google Docs floating

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,470
in the ether and nobody really was

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,090
talking to any anybody else and then

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,090
these challenges you see here on the

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,440
right hopefully you can see I don't

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,240
think they're unique to Audubon I think

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,390
every every organization whether they're

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,570
private public for-profit struggles with

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,460
this experts working in silos technical

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,870
in tech infrastructure under development

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,360
and so forth but the one I want to

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,890
highlight and was really a big barrier

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,930
to entry for us with this tool was

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,030
resistance to change you have groups

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,350
that have been doing their spreadsheets

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,300
and their finances and their data

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,630
management the same way for so many

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,070
years that this is really why we

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,090
designed the tool and what's something

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,780
we knew we were going to have to

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,670
struggle with from the start and the

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,430
last thing I'll say is that the

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,070
literature says time and time again that

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,440
Co developing code designing something

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,110
so that's not done in isolation but with

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,490
others with stakeholders we're gonna

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,830
essentially drive the process and

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,540
produce more meaning produce a tool

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,030
that's more meaningful and salient to

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,830
those involved is really important so we

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,230
set out to engage people from the very

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:01,080
beginning our board and our donors

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,300
leadership conservation staff everybody

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,250
in the network and it became pretty

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,350
clear that the first use case for this

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,180
tool which you'll see in a moment was

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,210
for fundraising so that we could

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,970
fundraise the development of our back

00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,200
end which is still under development

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,240
nobody wants to fund a back end they

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,610
want to see a sexy front end and use

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,040
that to fund the back end so that's that

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,630
became pretty clear early on as well as

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,860
this whole countability piece and

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,520
priority setting and so forth so that's

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,330
where we are

00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,890
and fortunately we asked ffw to help us

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,660
out in this venture and they said yes

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:41,910
and Morgan's going to tell you about it

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:46,410
terrific thank you so greg has given you

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,480
guys a background on sort of Audubon and

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,360
what the need was there I'm gonna talk a

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,520
little bit about the project itself and

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,670
the engagement and the process that went

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,250
into it so first of all a little bit

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,900
about the ask and you know one of the

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,510
things that we talked a lot about during

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,270
our discovery process was this crossing

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,000
point this

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:09,370
between conservation and technology how

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,720
can we use one to leverage the other and

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,980
amplify in the process similarly as Greg

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,580
mentioned there were many different

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,050
audiences for conservation information

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,920
and conservation tracking information

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:27,460
how could we build an experience that

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,320
worked well for those various audiences

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,030
who sometimes have very different needs

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,650
some are scientific and professional

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:38,830
while others are grassroots and and you

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,840
know non professional if you like and we

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,670
decided that we wanted decided very

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,890
early on that we wanted to have a

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:48,160
destination we drove people to for

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:51,070
individual bird species and individual

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,430
landscapes that was a content and data

00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:57,070
rich report card so a consistent

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,650
experience that was data visualization

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,080
that brought together all the various

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,790
disparate content and information

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,860
sources that were sprinkled throughout

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,780
the organization and that were available

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,790
through various different sources how

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,770
can we bring all those together in one

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,430
place under a great experience

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:18,490
and then lastly use site metrics to

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,590
drive most popular information we see

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,740
this every day on consumer retail sites

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,960
you go to Amazon you go to eBay you

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,690
might also like people like you also

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:32,590
looked at X so how can we bring that

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,750
type of experience to the conservation

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,880
tracking world where there are literally

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,770
thousands of species and thousands of

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,470
landscapes instead of asking people to

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,960
start at the top every single time how

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,450
can we use their behavioral data to

00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,070
drive the experience and narrow it a

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,170
little bit when they come in the front

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,390
door so that they're seeing species from

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:56,470
their location or that other people like

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:58,690
them have also looked at from a user

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,630
experience point of view and we want us

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:05,980
to make it interactive make it easy make

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:07,570
it flexible and make it compelling you

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,040
know sometimes when a lot of data comes

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,230
together in one place you get this

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,700
kludgy experience that's not really that

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,890
useful that you kind of have to wade

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,100
through we wanted to try and be clean

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,769
about it and really deliver a

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,720
a beautiful experience that showcased

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,199
all the data but not in a way that was

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,910
overwhelming we wanted to visualize

00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:31,769
rather than list data wherever possible

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:34,779
so show it rather than tell it have map

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:37,449
information talk to chart and graph

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,100
information and vice versa one of the

00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,920
things that we talked a lot about was

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,860
making the data manipulable allowing

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,170
very tactile interactive control of data

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,509
so as that as folks moved around and

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,899
interacted with the maps so charts and

00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:53,800
graphs would update and vice versa

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,720
don't let the data overwhelm the

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,279
experience there's so much information

00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,110
about some of these species and

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,569
landscapes that it was difficult to say

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:05,529
okay look how can we put this in a small

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:07,750
space on the screen and make it work

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,389
well and then lastly integrated

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,100
seamlessly with the existing Audubon org

00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:15,459
site I don't know if you've been to

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:19,120
Audubon org but it is a beautifully

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,370
designed incredibly visual very clean

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,709
design experience and so we wanted to

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,209
make sure we mapped right into that so

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:29,050
we adopted a lot of the look and feel

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:30,730
conventions from it specific

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,990
requirements that we were given when we

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,939
went through our discovery process

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,160
concentrate raw conservation data

00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:38,649
together in one place and visualize it

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,970
so it tells a compelling story about

00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,160
what's happening with the particular

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,980
species or landscapes in terms of

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,589
threats to it actions being taken to

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,490
mitigate those threats responses based

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:50,769
on those actions

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,980
so not only snapshotting the information

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:55,089
but showing progress over time and then

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,680
against those actions what a

00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,170
conservation efforts are in place to

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,529
protect that species or landscapes in

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,699
terms of goals specific initiatives

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,430
partnerships with outside organizations

00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:08,860
and individual priorities within a

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,230
larger goal be able to answer those

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,230
common request questions and address

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,689
consistent needs such as Greg's bosses

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,819
boss you know how are we doing so be

00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:21,100
able to use the data to actually deliver

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:23,740
an insight not just to deliver the data

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,569
for the sake of it and then obviously

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,889
communicate trends over time and that's

00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:32,290
the tracker part of the experience so

00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,760
that was the ask if you like I'm gonna

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,630
switch gears now and talk a little bit

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,519
about the process that we went through

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,870
so many of you in the room here will be

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,600
very familiar with what you're seeing

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:46,959
here it's similar to many other software

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,209
development processes we like to think

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,680
that we over index on the early part of

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:56,230
it that we call discovery because really

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,750
focusing on understanding and clarifying

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,480
with our client what the business goals

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:06,370
are at the same time that we're looking

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,930
at user needs and wants at the same time

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,760
that we're looking at the technology

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,069
underpinnings that have to support the

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,019
experience is where you get to that

00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,850
sweet spot that is what we will design

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,860
and build you know we've all been in

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,209
situations where a design has happened

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,519
that just can't be built cuz the

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,050
technology doesn't exist or we've built

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,519
something that's fantastic from a

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,990
technical point of view but the

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,240
experience is not that great or it

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,730
doesn't meet the business goals we focus

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,160
really really carefully on understanding

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,730
that sweet spot where a business user

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,339
and system interact to get to an optimal

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,309
solution for the from the point of view

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,870
of the conservation tracker we went

00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:47,290
through that process working with Greg

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,000
and his team we then wireframe - so that

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,699
we could see the progression or the user

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,850
journey through the experience we built

00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:56,949
out the interactive reports seeing what

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,139
the data actually looks like once it

00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,850
showed up because sometimes it looks

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,740
good and sometimes it's not so

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,490
cooperative and you have to work with it

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,839
and we tested it with with with various

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,610
audiences to make sure that it was

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,520
working and we revised based on that

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:14,589
before working with our technology team

00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,209
in a very agile way and that's not to

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,880
say that the technology team was not

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,890
involved throughout because they were

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,429
it's very much a part of the way we work

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,289
that were highly collaborative between

00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:31,690
business and strategy design and

00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:33,700
development okay so as Greg said our

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,679
experience strategy was to really

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,980
connect with people that are passionate

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,440
about conservation and primarily funders

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,850
and donors and the Audubon board but

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,880
secondarily

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,340
conservation staff scientists working on

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,870
conservation the autobahn network so

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,970
that loose network of connected

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,950
organizations and of course the general

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,620
public and what you're looking at here

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,960
below is what we developed as the

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,610
primary user journey or happy path if

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,230
you like we want us to make sure that

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,120
there was a warm welcome when people

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,860
landed in the conservation tracker world

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,870
because there's a lot of data in there

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,720
there's a lot of information a lot of

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,399
content so that first glimpse where you

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,070
establish the mental model for the

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:16,690
experience is very very important we

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,149
then wanted to make sure that we put in

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,710
place a powerful search mechanism so

00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:23,769
that whether folks wanted to search by

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,899
keyword by hunt-and-peck if you like

00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,850
clicking through and browsing or by

00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:31,419
another means we gave them multiple

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:35,080
avenues into the data once they down

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:37,690
selected to either a subset or a single

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,909
species or landscape that they wanted to

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,830
learn more about make that data

00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:44,350
interactive allow people to interact

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,029
with it touch it move it around play

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,080
with it to make it the way they want

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:51,700
make it easy to download so as Greg has

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,710
mentioned you know various different

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,509
audiences had multiple needs for the

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,320
content and so we wanted to make it easy

00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,360
to deliver on that

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,570
and then lastly make sure that people

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,730
leave having had a good experience you

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,919
know from a user experience point of

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,889
view which is what I focus on and that

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,110
that takeaway experience is very

00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:12,700
important because if they come and they

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,740
have a good experience and they leave

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,830
happy they'll say something about us or

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,889
they'll come back and we intend for this

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,600
tool to be used as you know not just a

00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:24,279
one-time thing but as a continual

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,629
resource for people interested in

00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:31,269
tracking conservation ok

00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:34,120
just before we look at the the prototype

00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,129
itself we have some stuff to work with

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,590
when we started there was an initial

00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:41,700
prototype that had been built to connect

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,929
some of the data sources to

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,769
visualization tools whether those were

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:49,179
bar charts or mapping experiences but

00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,590
what we were finding is that when all of

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,659
those things showed up on the screen

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,480
they weren't really telling a story and

00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,530
they weren't really working together to

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,050
deliver insight

00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,030
it was just an accumulation of data and

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,820
so we work very hard with Greg and

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,620
Johanna on the team to really map at the

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,790
real estate because don't forget on the

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,950
web you're dealing with the low

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,210
resolution sequential environment so

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,140
there's only so much you can bring

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,360
together in one space and you have to

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,070
balance and compromise and make

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,290
decisions about what to show first

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,180
second third I call that eyeball

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,320
management but it's very important

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,840
especially when you're bringing together

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,080
a lot of data a lot of content and in a

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,790
tight space so once we talk through that

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,920
and done quite a bit of virtual

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,050
whiteboarding we went through a process

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,460
of building out wireframes are you guys

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,150
familiar with wireframes if you worked

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,860
with those before pretty straightforward

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,360
we worked in desktop and mobile because

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,400
this is a fully responsive experience

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,190
and we you know we have breakpoints in

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,470
between so it will work on tablets both

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,410
landscape and portrait as well but you

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,170
can see that we worked through the

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,300
welcome experience landing pages and

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,580
then specific deeper dives so that we

00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,370
understand how the information presents

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,620
at multiple levels of depth from welcome

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:09,100
right through to interactive report card

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,170
and at the most detailed level once we

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,020
built at the wireframes we worked on

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,990
visual design comps and we built a

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,330
clickable prototype now this is not code

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:22,540
this is not developed in Drupal this is

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:25,090
essentially static comps that are daisy

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:29,230
chained together in order to simulate

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,790
the experience of the developed code and

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,190
what that allowed us to do was it

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,950
allowed us to take it and and and share

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,350
it with various target audiences and get

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,390
feedback which is hugely important

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,800
because things that we think else very

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,770
straightforward you can get from A to B

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,690
no problem it's pretty pretty easy you

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,760
find that other folks might get hung up

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,380
on and vice-versa things that you think

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,440
weren't such a big deal people say wow

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,260
that's really cool so this process of

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,480
learning as you design continuous

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,680
iteration is really really important

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,090
when it comes to good data visualization

00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,910
experiences and you'll see as we look

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,940
through the actual live site now in a

00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,269
moment things that you see here didn't

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,769
make it

00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:13,959
to the design or things that you see

00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:17,169
here have been refined and enhanced in

00:22:13,959 --> 00:23:11,469
the actual design okay

00:22:17,169 --> 00:23:12,879
let's switch gears one sec so we're

00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:15,039
gonna take a quick look at the actual

00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:16,629
live experience right now but before we

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,509
dive in I just want to say a little bit

00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:22,299
about Autobahn org the conservation

00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:27,039
tracker is based on the look and feel of

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:29,499
the live Autobahn org site which is just

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,839
spectacular from a visual point of view

00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:36,399
one of the things that Greg and his team

00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,929
are really lucky in is that people take

00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:40,899
photographs of birds all the time and

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:43,479
they submit them for competitions -

00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:46,690
autumn on so they have this incredible

00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:48,789
library of just fabulous imagery that is

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,559
used throughout the site experience and

00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,509
it's constantly being refreshed because

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,459
there's annual photo competitions for

00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:57,099
both professional photographers amateur

00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:58,779
photographers youth photographers with

00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:00,999
the result that the site is visually

00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:03,700
stunning so we wanted to steel with

00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,959
pride all of that that had already been

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,509
done and that was working really really

00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:10,690
well as we talk through the conservation

00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:12,219
tracker so switching over to the

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,969
conservation tracker here you can see

00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:19,719
that the global master HUD and the

00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:22,539
welcome image Convention is adopted 100%

00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:23,770
and you have this parallax experience

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:27,220
here where you scrolled

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,750
to reveal the page that you're on and so

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,330
this is the welcome experience for the

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,880
conservation tracker you can see that

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,690
there's three major areas within it

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,220
strategies species and landscapes

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,800
essentially those are three buttons so

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,720
you can choose to search by keyword if

00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,480
you would like to get to something

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,550
specific if you know what that is or you

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,530
can click on one of the main areas and

00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,420
we'll go into each one of those in a

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,280
little bit more detail in a moment or

00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,890
you can click on some of the information

00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,440
that's popular right now and this is

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:03,040
what I talked about a few moments ago in

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,580
terms of using site usage metrics to

00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:10,150
drive experiences on the homepage to

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:12,570
shortcut the journey for folks within a

00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,100
certain geography with a known interest

00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,230
with a previous visit that we know

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,320
something about so to the extent that we

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,420
can use data of actual behavior on the

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,520
site to then drive a shortened

00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,330
experience in the future we try to do

00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,330
that whenever we can

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:20,110
yeah we've done a lot of work with maps

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,430
and manipulating map data as part of

00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,490
this process so again that's

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:26,530
transferable to any application where

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,840
you need to show data connect it to

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,880
topography in some way okay

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,830
so let's dive in and we're gonna click

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,530
through to the strategies section first

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:38,410
we got bandwidth so again beautiful

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:42,010
imagery just stunning imagery of birds

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:45,760
available to us all the time and this is

00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:53,700
the strategy section so it's kind of

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,700
small any bigger it's a little bigger so

00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:03,250
each strategy is broken down into coasts

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:06,550
working lands water bird friendly

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:08,710
communities and climate and within each

00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:11,710
one of those categories or sections

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:15,670
there is an overview which you're seeing

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,680
displayed right here you can look at

00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:21,150
goals associated with that strategy

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:25,210
whether those are conservation goals or

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:27,430
engagement goals you can see the

00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,320
partners that Audubon is working with

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:32,280
and who are either contributing to or

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,010
banishing benefiting from the experience

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,130
you can see specific initiatives

00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:43,580
associated with that strategy and then

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:46,670
the priority bird species and landscapes

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:50,510
that it touches and you have the ability

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:53,060
to move things around the map is fully

00:27:50,510 --> 00:28:00,320
interactive you can click on any one of

00:27:53,060 --> 00:28:02,180
the nodes here to see a little bit about

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,490
what's happening in that particular area

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,160
relative to the strategy that we're

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,200
looking at right now so this is where

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,150
the data visualization aspect of this

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,960
comes into play it's highly interactive

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,320
highly manipulable and while not all the

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,820
data is in place for every single

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,220
landscape or every single species yet

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,550
the goal ultimately is to be able to

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,380
click through from any of these nodes to

00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,960
what we talked about a few moments ago

00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,630
which is the interactive report card for

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,760
that landscape or that species which is

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,930
that rich data environment on a single

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,930
screen we're going to look at that

00:28:45,610 --> 00:29:01,720
because it wasn't adding enough value

00:28:48,490 --> 00:29:01,720
real estate for the most part yeah

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,720
the files themselves the flat files were

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:45,380
created and sketch and the clickable

00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,640
prototype was created in vision there's

00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,000
a hundred different ways you could do it

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,740
though but envision is just fast and

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,880
it's also very shareable so we could

00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,260
essentially share the link with Greg and

00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,380
his team and they can make comments

00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,880
right in the file so it's it's one of

00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,160
those like Google Docs it's the Google

00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,160
Docs version of prototyping essentially

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,970
we could see it the screenshare so it's

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,600
just very easy to annotate make changes

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,600
and make sure

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:30,320
and I think when you've got remotely

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,799
located teams that ability to see the

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,049
same thing at the same time and to

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,419
annotate and make comments on the file

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:40,070
itself while the discussion is happening

00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:43,130
it's huge

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,750
because if if if somebody takes notes

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,909
and then they have to go back and relate

00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,889
that to a designer who then has to make

00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:51,169
the updates share the link with the

00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,730
client who then says well that kind of

00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:55,429
wasn't what exactly I was looking for

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,809
buying all that goes away so that that

00:30:55,429 --> 00:31:00,470
process and we talked about it like

00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:02,600
collaboration it's it's just there's so

00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,600
many decisions to be made that that

00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,090
process of thinking it through together

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,950
is is hugely beneficial in terms of

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,510
getting to you know good result in the

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,510
end Hey

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,850
well it the project took more than four

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,200
weeks it was more like four months but

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,549
the the user experience the testing well

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,120
right the design portion was pretty

00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:59,880
quick essentially once we have the

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,429
clickable prototype in envision you have

00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,530
something to test that represents the

00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:07,230
primary journey not every single screen

00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:09,120
but just enough to to make a feel wheel

00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,360
if you like what we did is we put

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,340
together at a script based on our

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,010
understanding of the target audiences

00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,080
and what their needs and wants were so

00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,789
we asked them you know what are the

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,090
types of things you wanted to get done

00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:26,700
can you do them can you find this are

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:29,700
you able to find a specific species can

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:33,210
you tell us what the threat is to a

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:35,250
specific landscape and so on and so we

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,380
sort of probed for people's ability to

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,380
intuitively get to get to the

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,850
information from the highest level and

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,980
from the most part they could it was

00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,600
surprising you know there was very few

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,789
things that tripped people up a couple

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,460
of labels so we went back in and we put

00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:53,250
in instructional copy here and there to

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,809
just help people if there was a kind of

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,730
a hesitation moment because we were

00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:00,090
watching at the same time we did the

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,650
user testing remotely but with video so

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,480
you had a video of the person doing the

00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:07,500
test he had a video of what they were

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,929
they were doing on the screen and then

00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,150
there was the the questionnaire

00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:15,200
moderator guide that we went through as

00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,200
we went through the process

00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:25,450
the that was where we had one sacrifice

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,299
based on timing with very little time so

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:48,070
we used designated experts that Audubon

00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:58,299
nominated for us and next week I go to

00:33:48,070 --> 00:34:00,639
New York City to work with trying to

00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:02,710
convince them that this tool can be

00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:05,350
useful for their work this can save them

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,960
time it's not just another tool and I

00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,970
don't know if you folks familiar with

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,429
like the human-computer interactions

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:15,460
literature but just divided between the

00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:18,099
developer and the user then is what

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,569
we're trying to narrow and if anybody

00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:24,099
has thoughts suggestions words of wisdom

00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:26,079
I'd be happy to talk afterwards because

00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:28,510
it's you know you can develop something

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,649
as beautiful as it is and it's solid and

00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:36,690
bug proof as as it is but are people

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:39,369
actually gonna use it that's the issue

00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,139
we're trying to unwrap to that and we

00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:45,480
have a whole onboard digital onboarding

00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,480
exercise but yeah see

00:34:51,599 --> 00:35:01,059
experience are you you know getting

00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:06,579
information yeah it's a great question

00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:08,559
we had some we had some ideas on that in

00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:10,599
the from the beginning but it evolved

00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,010
into right now that because some of the

00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:13,960
information is still pretty sensitive

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,250
and we still have to work that out

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,619
through different committees that we're

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,150
organizing it's password protected and

00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,250
for internal use only

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,869
but let's fast forward once we're

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,490
through that and we have a body of

00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,049
reports and things that we want to share

00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,900
and we want to make it public facing

00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:32,190
will remove the password screen and then

00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:35,769
we would we would talk with ffw to

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:37,089
develop you know a user you know login

00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:38,589
and that sort of things that we could

00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:41,260
have information about them if that's

00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:42,730
the capital wanna take so we wanted to

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,049
do that upfront but we decided it's

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,180
probably best to wait until we were

00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:49,170
ready to make it public facing that sort

00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,170
of credentials

00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,090
I think there's also there's a there's a

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,500
crawl walk run aspect to it I think you

00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,400
have to get something out there first

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,900
and then we've we talked a lot about

00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,090
passive personalization and active

00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,500
personalization passive personalization

00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,060
is what do we know about you when we

00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,890
know nothing about you how did you

00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,720
arrive what search term did you use what

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,010
site domain did you come from you know

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,720
what do we know about you that we can

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,980
use to sort of passively personalize the

00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,150
experience as Patrick just mentioned

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,800
seasonal information geographic

00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,410
information demographic information and

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,990
then over time the run aspect becomes

00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:52,140
the integration of is it Acquia lyft or

00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:56,740
some sort of a personalization

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:58,840
experience that would allow us to really

00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,820
really understand who that visitor was

00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,000
because they had a profile and then you

00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:06,210
can return you can return them exactly

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,210
right

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,789
[Music]

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,410
it runs the gamut so yeah I mean there's

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:36,210
like the Christmas Bird Count once a

00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:38,190
year and so we're having developing

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,080
forms where people can add data and

00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,030
it'll all seem to talk to each other but

00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,130
going back to your previous question I

00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,030
think it's a good reminder about

00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:50,700
demographics and just understanding our

00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:52,110
user a little better there was one other

00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,280
question here and then I think we're

00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,280
gonna have to wrap it up hi

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,440
great question so right now it's my

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,120
colleague and I Johanna who are gonna be

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,650
kind of maintaining it and because it

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,570
just leads JSON file it's pretty

00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,570
