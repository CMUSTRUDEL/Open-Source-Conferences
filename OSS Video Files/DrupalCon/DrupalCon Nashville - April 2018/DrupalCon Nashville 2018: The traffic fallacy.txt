Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: The traffic fallacy
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	You’ve probably been late to something once, only to find as you drive onto the freeway hoping that you can try to make up for some of that lost time, it’s backed up for what looks like miles and miles. You call your friend and update them that the 15 min drive is now looking like at least an hour. That’s just a guess, though, you really have no idea as you lack the visibility into the conditions of the bigger system that you’re now a part of. You’re probably annoyed too, because waiting and sitting in traffic is a waste of time and the person behind you is trying to honk their way through it! It'd be great if this 4-lane freeway were 6-lanes! Ugh!

The solution cities have historically taken to traffic problems has been to add more lanes (capacity) or more traffic signals (process). Similarities exist in software development, where in the spirit of trying to get more things done faster, often times more people are added or more process is enforced. While well intentioned, this can end up slowing things down even more. 

In order to do more, faster, a solution we’ve found to be successful is to visualize our workflow and limit our work in progress. Traffic jams have become rare, and most importantly, value is delivered to customer’s with increased predictability, along with improvements to team morale.  

In this session we’ll explore: 

What a work unit is
Techniques to visualize and organize the flow of work 
Finding the right work in progress limit for a team
Pull versus push
Going from good to great

great so Oh No

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,549
of course

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,540
great so a little bit about me there get

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,270
us started here the sessions the traffic

00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,040
policy it's a little bit about me on the

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,050
one hand I kind of have this dual role

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,970
which is pretty exciting I help

00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,770
organisations figure out what problem

00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,080
we're trying to solve who are trying to

00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,000
solve it for and most importantly why

00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,190
we're trying to solve it but on the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,379
other hand I have this great little

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,879
thing that I do sometimes or I help

00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:47,440
teams kind of explore and experiment

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,100
with different ways of working together

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,320
right I help focus on bringing agile and

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,150
lean values and principles in action on

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,829
those teams to help reduce some of the

00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,410
friction that can be found in software

00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,780
development a little bit about the

00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,700
organization that I work for last call

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,040
media we enjoy doing work with purpose

00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,740
right and helping build engaging tools

00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,220
that support the communities that these

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,470
organizations support so I came and an

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,759
interesting thing happened me are

00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,540
sitting in traffic this rare event and

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,520
this was a little while ago and I

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,149
thought to myself wow why is this still

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,869
a thing

00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:28,300
right in 2018 in certain cities it just

00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,220
keeps getting worse it just never seems

00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,539
like it's getting better so I googled it

00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,640
while I was stuck in traffic in an uber

00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:35,800
you know what is the worst traffic in

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,300
the world and it came across this pretty

00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,610
interesting story in 2004 Houston Texas

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,590
like many cities had a major traffic

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,619
problem it was essentially taking too

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,170
long to go for these vehicles to go from

00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,630
A to B and it was a city experiencing

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,910
massive population growth and its roads

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,009
hadn't really caught up with with the

00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,009
increase in population so this meant

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:02,170
traffic just kept getting worse so the

00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:06,399
Katy Freeway here anyone here from Texas

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,229
anyone here from Houston cool there's

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,149
this interstate 10 I've never driven on

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,680
interstate 10 but I'm imagining if I did

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,470
I get stuck in a lot of traffic based on

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,200
when I ran so it takes you from downtown

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,270
Houston to the west 30 miles and it

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,400
takes about an average of 41 minutes to

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,870
go those 28 miles from downtown Houston

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,580
Decatur land so the recognizing that

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,790
that was a totally undesirable state of

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,600
affairs the american highway user

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,550
alliance

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,540
is a group that I learned about

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,180
published their findings after they

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,820
explored the reasons behind the traffic

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,860
issue here and they determined that this

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,130
freeway was the second most congested

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:48,610
Road in America so they calculated this

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,100
in hours that about 25 million hours are

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,690
wasted by people sitting in cars on this

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,010
freeway right and when you're sitting in

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,180
traffic behind the wheel you're not

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,220
working you're not taking care of your

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,300
kids you're not adding essentially any

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,640
value to your life right not helping

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,200
move any of your goals forward so I just

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,000
out of curiosity if you divide that by

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,000
the average hours in a lifetime that's

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,680
40 life times a year so and with

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,960
vehicles per day increasing with

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,610
population growth this delay would more

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,380
than double right so this study was

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,390
conducted they determined that this is

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,850
only going to get worse and when you put

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,670
a dollar amount on this massive delay

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,740
some simple math let's just assume here

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,800
simply that every rider has the

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,750
opportunity on average to earn $20 an

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,240
hour doing pretty much anything else

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,710
besides sitting in traffic right so when

00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,540
you multiply that by those number of

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,100
hours you get about you know half a

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,440
billion dollars a year and lost

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,270
opportunity and then you have to add in

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,330
all sorts of other indirect costs right

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,520
increased fuel charges babysitting costs

00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,740
shipping costs etc just get the number

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,240
just goes up and up and up and up so

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,510
they recognize that this was just not

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,910
desirable and they worked to solve this

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,730
problem so the highway Alliance

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,880
conducted further surveys and they

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,430
concluded that bottlenecks caused by too

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,440
many cars on too little Road are to

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,560
blame for about half of all traffic jams

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,510
right traffic accidents work zones bad

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,230
weather and poor signal timing account

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,690
for the rest okay cool we can fix that

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,340
right bottlenecks the other half

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,020
appeared to be random can't do much

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,410
about those unavoidable and

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,970
unpredictable conclusion too many cars

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,070
not enough freeway sounds pretty logical

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,610
extra capacity I'm imagining this room

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,200
with a bunch of really smart engineers

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,790
extra capacity which surely solve this

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,979
problem right a reasonable person in

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,580
that room more lanes would mean more

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:44,349
room

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,710
for more cars which would mean shorter

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:51,189
travel times so therefore let's get our

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:55,060
shovels and let's build more freeway so

00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:57,699
the state of Texas spent 2.8 billion

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,310
dollars to widen the Katy Freeway to 26

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,990
lanes that has a tremendous amount of

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,610
capacity 26 lanes

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,370
obviously in certain parts not the whole

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,250
thing but still that's an astronomical

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,159
sum but there's just one little problem

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,349
right congestion on the Katy has

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:16,599
actually become worse since that

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:20,889
expansion right travel times have

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:23,199
increased 55% it's gone to 64 minutes to

00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,690
go to those 28 miles between downtown

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,509
Houston and Katy land up from 41 minutes

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,940
in 2011 right so it wasn't interestingly

00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:33,039
enough the same amount of cars right as

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,710
the road increased the number of cars

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,900
also increased people saw the increase

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,360
in capacity and thought now I'm going to

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,150
use this highway that was previously too

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,680
congested right how could this be this

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,990
kind of flies in the face of common

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,969
sense so they went back to the data

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,029
there ran more models and they thought

00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:53,830
okay wow it wasn't the same amount of

00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:55,659
cars so we're still stuck with that

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,430
tremendous amount of traffic now I know

00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,259
I just talked quite a bit about Houston

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,659
but I'm sure we all know this is a

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,900
problem all over the world right here's

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:06,129
a 50 lane highway in Hong Kong they

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,409
bring it to between Hong Kong and Macau

00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:11,740
right this is just one summer day that

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:13,960
just looks like a mess but you know this

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,060
isn't intentional right for all we know

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,069
highway engineers have been saying this

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,639
for years the problem is not to add more

00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:23,620
lanes right but you know politics

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,199
elections big infrastructure projects

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:29,919
really help so you add more add more

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,389
lanes right but the real challenge I

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,900
learned during this little exploration

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,690
for city streets is to move people not

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,099
cars efficiently right takes a little a

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,080
little bit of a mind shift because you

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,089
think people are in cars right but

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,190
people can go from A to B in a wide

00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:46,710
variety of ways there's public transit

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,440
there's the car itself there's a bicycle

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,209
etc so in thinking about this you know

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,849
in the context of agile and lean

00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,380
principles despite capacity increases

00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,660
there are just too many

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,690
perhaps vehicles in progress which means

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,520
continued high road utilization with

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,490
leading to high throughput times and

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,110
idling vehicles right some of some

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,520
people may be familiar with like Kanban

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,800
thinking and limiting work in progress

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,470
right now and some of this stuff tied to

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,350
type of traffic so when the freeway is

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,390
full there's no slack right there's no

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,570
space on the road to allow for the

00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,860
inevitable variations in vehicles right

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,300
vehicles of different sizes we all drive

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,610
different speeds we all have different

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,430
driver confidence different skill levels

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,090
some people unfortunately still text and

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,190
drive lane merge aggressively etc and

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:40,000
then you have to factor in accidents

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,710
hazards etc so perhaps instead of

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,570
increasing the amount of Road and

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,180
spending close to three billion dollars

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,820
right since we can't control the

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,560
variation in vehicles right maybe if we

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,500
limited the number of vehicles on the

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,580
road at any given time we could create

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,290
slack or space so I think congested

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,220
freeways need a vehicle in progress

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,990
limit and cities and just coincidentally

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,770
know this to cities like New York

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,960
notorious for its traffic focused a lot

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,940
over the past year so I'm reducing the

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,700
number of vehicles on the road right

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,790
through congestion pricing and yet

00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,580
timely as of last week you can't see the

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,770
data I guess but on March 31st the state

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,420
legislature dismissed congestion pricing

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,840
and said we'll figure this out another

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,950
way

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,780
no-go Stockholm just quickly here had a

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,520
unique challenge rapid population growth

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,650
but as an island much like Manhattan

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,750
like by totals of bridges was

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,599
geographically unable to add more roads

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,849
but had rising congestion so they set up

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,330
a time boxed six-month experiment and

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:48,760
set a $1 toll to enter the main city

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,260
hoping to reduce congestion and people

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,410
hated it it was fiercely political

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,930
people just were outraged but when

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,750
people saw what became some interesting

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,790
data it quickly became permanent it

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,270
became faster to get to where you need

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:07,690
to go right people from A to B and when

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,800
you got there the air was cleaner so the

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,930
number of people in Stockholm

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,040
transit didn't decrease just the number

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,870
of vehicles so all that what about our

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,330
freeways right we have our own politics

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,339
but fortunately for most of us we don't

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,149
have to do with the state legislature to

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:27,709
navigate and try new things right but

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,540
how many of us have looked at their

00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,790
backlog and thought things are taking

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,250
forever and nothing is getting done

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,230
right perhaps you know speaking from a

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,500
little bit of experience here I think

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,870
you can take a look at a long list of

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,610
things and it just seems like people are

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,440
working really hard doing their best

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,750
that they can but things are just kind

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,269
of taken forever

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,010
as a you know a feeling that we have and

00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,990
then on you know who thought very much

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,269
like me well maybe we need to add more

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,459
people right bring more people into this

00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:02,720
more things will get done quicker right

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:05,329
but then who also perhaps had a team

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,339
member or many team members with greater

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:11,620
than one thing assigned to them at any

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:14,270
given time marked as in progress right

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,310
so this was speaking a little bit from

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,660
our experience and our journey here this

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,700
is what we were struggling with right we

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,329
found that everyone was incredibly busy

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,890
and working really hard yet value the

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:27,890
things that people were paying us to do

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,540
to get things into production for their

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,550
customers was taking too long to get

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,420
there right people had just way too much

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,120
on their plate and others perhaps with

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,230
not enough looking for more things to do

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,360
tasks were sitting around and unknown

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,730
States waiting for people to become free

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,800
and finally work on them and it was

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,230
stressing people out as well right

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,579
seeing things assigned to them the

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,560
number of things assigning to them

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,600
always increasing and the number of

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,040
things that they're getting to done just

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,560
seems so far away so we learned right

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,870
much like this freeway that differences

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,579
in tasks variation right not all tasks

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,370
are the same not all people are the same

00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,230
makes it difficult as an organization to

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,899
provide scheduling predictions as to

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,850
when something will get done so to

00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,760
maintain a positive customer experience

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,680
for the organizations that we work with

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,480
secondary needs were created as tasks

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,370
waiting right so from the business

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,510
perspective we had to have people pretty

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,070
skilled and now

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,570
getting difficult conversations to help

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,280
explain things like why things were

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,140
taking a little bit longer when things

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,970
would be done so when they're having

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,100
those conversations they're not really

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,600
delivering any value there's a way that

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,390
we could perhaps consider avoiding those

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,580
conversations so right the difference

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,140
between adding a blog feature is a lot

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,000
different than say running security

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,700
updates right and what this ends up

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,010
being is superfluous work non

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,790
value-adding work created to satisfy

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:54,440
customer needs so we were coming from a

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,090
very command and control management

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,310
technique right you're looking a little

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,500
like today let me give you a few more

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,120
tickets right as a project manager I'll

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,280
just make sure that you have a lot of

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,470
tickets signed to you that's what I'm

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,210
doing right you sure that's enough let

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,160
me give you a little bit more right you

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,840
can always just select the name on the

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,390
drop down and click Save and just adds

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,500
it to their list so I think a lot of

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,390
that comes from traditional management

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,520
literature right that says people need

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,710
to be a hundred percent utilized in

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,660
order to get more things done so the

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,580
goal of project management was to make

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,580
sure based on the literature that

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,020
everyone always had a full plate of work

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,720
but then we kept asking ourselves is

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,000
being busy and delivering value with

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,000
predictability are those things mutually

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,070
exclusive right can you be super busy

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,100
and also have some get things done or

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,810
not you know with predictability all

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,040
right but you know we don't have

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,380
billions of dollars like the state of

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,860
Texas so we can't build more lanes just

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,300
like that so how can we work with what

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,770
we have with the tools that we have with

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,660
the team that we have the people that we

00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,450
have the skills that we have and try new

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,130
things so we experimented with what

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,230
would it look like instead of focusing

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,000
on keeping people busy we focused

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,840
instead on delivering work to the

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,120
customer as quickly as possible and you

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,670
know another way perhaps more fun of

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,520
saying this was how do we put our good

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,650
ideas into action quickly right an idea

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,540
is essentially just an idea until you

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,550
can test it in production test the

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,250
business idea of it right not the code

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,470
in production cool because that's our

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,380
goal here right the whole point of all

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:34,640
this is to work in a sustainable pace to

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,430
get our ideas into production quickly so

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,440
we experimented again with three things

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,290
very much out of the Kanban literature

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,840
we work to visualize our process and a

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,420
commonplace move outside of electronic

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,790
tool at the time we were fortunate to

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,740
all be in the same office we had great

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:56,120
walls so we could think about you know

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:59,090
using those whiteboards and limiting our

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,330
work in progress and working together as

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,970
a team to improve the way that we work

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,370
so none of these experiments involved

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,770
making people work faster making them

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,160
work longer or making them work on the

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,750
weekends so the first step usually not

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,320
visualizing our process was pretty

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,580
pretty easy we moved from at the time

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,480
we've been using a combination of

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,950
electronic tools to a physical board

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,600
with columns that represented the

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,120
different work States right this proof

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,380
created a really great opportunity for

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,270
the team to have that high level

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,120
visibility to see what's in progress

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,220
who's working on what right but also who

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,150
is too much who is too little where are

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,860
their opportunities for knowledge

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,240
sharing and learning right where can

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,770
people essentially help each other right

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,420
when you're all having that conversation

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,160
in the morning right are there any

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,590
bottlenecks this is just a lot of work

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,330
kind of piling up in one column or is a

00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:55,370
lot of work piling up on one person

00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:56,870
right with too much you know with the

00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,210
bottlenecks you can discuss it can we do

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,600
anything about it and then it also kind

00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,640
of exposes this hidden work right where

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,770
something is in progress because your

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,620
project management tool says you know

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,270
ready in progress and done right a very

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,250
simple version of that and it's in

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,080
progress but really in progress can mean

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,970
like eight different things based on

00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,720
where it is and who's working on it so

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,800
you can sort of find those things and

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,950
represent those as a column on the board

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,730
if that makes sense so the second thing

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:31,010
is always a challenge we found right how

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,110
do we limit our work in progress because

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,940
I think as a team people really want to

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,890
do their best work and they come to that

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,110
daily stand up ready to do whatever it

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:42,080
takes right but we have to ask ourselves

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,080
and ask myself this every day how many

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,850
things can I really work on at one time

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,170
right it's really stressful to try and

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,570
actively work on many things at once

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:54,620
it's easier to get distracted

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,810
lose focus and decide perhaps ah maybe

00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:00,860
I'll work on this tomorrow just speaking

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,320
about myself again when you limit your

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,930
work in progress these bottlenecks

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,970
become clear and the team it's been

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,830
really cool that the team kind of talks

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,860
amongst themselves they self organized

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:16,190
and they figure out what's in progress

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,930
and who's working on what one thing at a

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,370
time

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,080
so how do we come up with these

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,200
work-in-progress limits these whip

00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,630
limits from observing the board right I

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,240
think to take this idea back you could

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,460
throw out a number to the team talk

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,680
about as a team but just throw these

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,580
numbers in the in the column and then

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,190
make sure that you have those

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,320
opportunities to monitor you know as a

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,300
team how these whip limits are working

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,060
are things getting stuck are too many

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:48,260
people idle you know observe the flow of

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,910
work and then talk about it so we have

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,400
these things called a flow unit which is

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,870
essentially just a card right and these

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,330
are the things these represent the

00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:00,140
actual task itself as it moves through

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:02,390
the queue and you can represent this

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,270
flow unit in a number of ways for us we

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,829
use JIRA pretty heavily so we have you

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,829
know JIRA ID that ties back to an

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,180
electronic system the due date just so

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,589
quickly you know you don't want to be

00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,339
able to look at this task and know

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,870
everything about it

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,760
but the people should be able to look at

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,910
this card and know what it is and where

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,320
to go for more information

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,800
getting started pretty simple right

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,589
we take a list of our work we prioritize

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,350
it based on its business value that's a

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,690
backlog right and a very simple sense

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,840
and the team works from the top of the

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,850
list at the bottom of the list and they

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,620
self organize and figure out how to pull

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,330
the work from one column to the next

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:46,360
column and through that queue so simple

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,630
stuff I'm sure folks here are doing this

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:53,600
and you know as an example here's our

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,530
board of cards right in my life it's

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
simple right

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,880
it matches some workflow that's just me

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,620
working on stuff I don't need much of a

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,060
traditional process let's give you a

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,680
board in JIRA could be Trello or

00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,900
whatever but before we distribute

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,050
we had boards a little bit more complex

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:12,390
than this obviously for a team because

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,960
this is just me with my one thing in

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,370
progress so in this example I'm

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,930
visualizing how my work gets done

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,710
I hold the daily stand up with myself

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:25,080
and I pull tasks from to do to doing and

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,610
then from doing to done kind of one

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,300
direction right and then I repeat the

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,130
next day right and since I have a whip

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,230
limit of one I move one thirty four to

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,880
done and then I grab another because I

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,740
promised myself I wouldn't leave work

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,290
unfinished that's important to me

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,490
because I feel that unfinished work is

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,450
useless so agreeing that I would only

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,240
work on one thing at a time

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,980
I kept starting things though and you

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
know there's this problem here I'm

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,460
really busy I've got a lot of things

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,440
that I'm working on right but why is

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,180
that a problem nothing is getting too

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,710
done right nothing is getting to the

00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,620
customer nothing is delivering really

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,850
ultimately on its on the business value

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,450
that we are hoping to get into

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:09,900
production but on more complex projects

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:12,570
right with more people our boards may

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,270
look like this in this example as a

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:18,090
something that the team decided that

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,910
made sense for them not all boards need

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,880
to look like this there are whip limits

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,680
right so you've got analyze here with

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,990
the whip limit of four but there are

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,030
three things there so that's okay you've

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,650
got things in testing there's a whip

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,570
limit of five there but there are four

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,700
so kind of a pretty healthy board the

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,830
team may feel hey and that daily stand

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,450
up I think what I want to do today is up

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,550
get rid of some of these things that are

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,590
user acceptance testing right let's move

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,770
those through because I know that we've

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,120
got quite a bit over here you know and

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,950
sector for development and analyze

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,470
that'll be coming through what we don't

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,030
want is to be in a situation where we've

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,890
got a bunch of stuff in progress and we

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,690
can't move it into testing because we've

00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,850
got that whip limit there so let's focus

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,220
how can we together as a team move

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,400
things from user acceptance testing into

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:08,580
ready for deploy right so the team can

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,690
kind of perhaps swarm on that and then

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,980
if there are things that just keep

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,590
getting stuck that's a great

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,030
conversation to have in a retrospective

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,980
right or depending on how you're working

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,390
you may the team may feel like they just

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,720
want to talk about why things keep

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,370
getting

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,610
right then in there if that's a

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:26,270
productive conversation so when that

00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,740
entire team has visibility into the work

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,450
they can they have opportunities to help

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,460
each other figure out who's the best

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,200
person to do what right because the best

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,909
person to figure out whether or not a

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,850
task is appropriate for them is that

00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:40,409
person rather than someone else deciding

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:44,039
and then assigning that person that task

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:45,870
so it's a conversation and this helped

00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,789
us by doing this and proved another

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,530
issue which is that some folks had too

00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,270
much on their plate and some folks not

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,710
enough I think that may just be

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,110
something that we'll continue

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,970
experimenting with and and looking at

00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:01,080
but it is you know still something that

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:03,179
we're working on it's approved and of

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,400
course things go from to do to done

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,110
right and that's kind of what the team

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,270
decided that it makes sense for things

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:13,980
to go in one direction so this thinking

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,570
right and that Anna model here to

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,299
represent that we're asking ourselves

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,909
who's kind of adapting to who right and

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,830
the traditional approach for resources

00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:24,450
that resource efficiency approach where

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,520
you want a hundred percent people to be

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,500
busy a hundred percent of the time the

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,090
team member is always busy the flow unit

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,919
does a lot of waiting right it's sitting

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,799
one team member has three things

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,200
assigned to them you put a camera on the

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,690
shoulder of the team member of the

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,309
developer or whoever it is and the

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,840
camera is always busy right they're

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:46,799
running around they're crazy they're

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,240
juggling so a lot of things right but

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,600
since we agree now that only one flow

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,990
unit can be in progress at a time if we

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,360
flip that right and we put a camera on

00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,890
the team members shoulder again the team

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,179
member may have some slack they may not

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,610
always be busy right

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,190
but that flow unit that work itself is

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,230
constantly busy a camera on the flow

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,429
unit shoulder would show that that that

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,630
flow unit is just moving straight

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:11,280
through as quickly as possible

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,780
right and that's kind of what you want

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,809
that's the objective is to get the thing

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,600
itself the idea from one end of the cue

00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:19,980
to the other

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,450
so flow efficiency there's this great

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,970
book called this is lean I highly

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,010
recommend that if this is of interest

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,450
and it argues that flow efficiency is an

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,600
operational strategy right not a

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,340
business strategy is the sum of all the

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,950
value adding activities in a relation

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,400
- throughput time so okay cool what does

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,450
that mean

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,880
so flow efficiency is the value adding

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,860
activities or things like development

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,289
creative perhaps project management

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,880
testing those are value-adding

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:50,549
activities right they contribute to

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,650
increasing the fidelity of this idea is

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,570
something that goes from perhaps a few

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,559
words and a user story and there's

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,630
something that's sitting on production

00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,850
versus the throughput time right which

00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,679
is how long did it take from when that

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,450
ticket was created or that sticky was

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,350
written to when that idea got on

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,630
production so as an operational strategy

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,390
what we want to work toward as an

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,149
organization is reducing the non

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,340
value-adding activities like flow units

00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:20,039
waiting waiting for testing waiting for

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,799
a wide variety of things right what this

00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,600
doesn't say is make people work faster

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,950
make people work harder make people

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,450
learn more make people work on the

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:32,610
weekends so as an example here as an

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,559
administrator right I want to be able to

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,960
enable site-wide notifications perhaps

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,490
I'm a school there's a snow day so

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,260
visitors can see important alerts and

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,480
changes to the schedule in this simple

00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,940
example right so the value adding time

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,429
time spent with creative and development

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,470
eight hours right those are perhaps if

00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:51,630
in an agency setting or if you're in

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,649
sort of a cost recovery situation that's

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,049
the amount of time that you can build

00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:59,130
for right but the time period how long

00:23:55,049 --> 00:24:01,770
was that in your queue so took 120 hours

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,779
right divided by 8 the number of days so

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,490
you can calculate you know what your

00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:10,440
flow efficiency is here as a measurement

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:12,659
of being 6.6% and then let's take the

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,490
flip side of that when you're focusing

00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,380
as an organization on flow efficiency as

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,240
your operational strategy you're

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,490
evaluating time still the same eight

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,250
hours but because you built slack into

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,720
your system and your people are pulling

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,669
tasks to them rather than having things

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,840
assigned and you're limiting your work

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,940
in progress to one and you're

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,580
visualizing your progress as a team your

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,620
work flow as a team it really took 24

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,320
hours right less than a week to go from

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:40,020
when the idea was initially created or

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,630
had to when it was live on production so

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,510
your flow efficiency there is 33.3%

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:48,570
right what does that even really mean

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,980
right I don't know if and looking into

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,590
the literature if there's really such a

00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,380
thing as the target flow efficiency

00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,820
right considering the variation in our

00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,710
work not sure that it even really

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,799
matters but it's I think more of an

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,690
exercise and measuring it right so you

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:06,210
can then in a retrospective discuss as a

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,010
team hey you know every time we seem

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,799
they get a task like this things you

00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:12,240
know you know is there a way that we

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,160
could perhaps adjust the way that we

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,330
work to get this through faster like

00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,620
where does this where does this kind of

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,940
task continue to find itself getting

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,400
stuck and can we do anything about it

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,960
right because measurement when you have

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,460
those opportunities is the kind of a

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,600
great way to know if you're improving as

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,100
a team all this possible because we you

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,840
know we haven't unlimited traffic jams

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,710
right and our workflow we just now have

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,890
a fewer so when do you start that timer

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:40,290
when when does it end so when it comes

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:43,500
in to do right it can kind of be sitting

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:45,600
there not adding any value but the timer

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,610
starts when the thing is real right if

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,140
you're an organization and you need to

00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,910
get approval on certain things right so

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,000
whenever it's approved whenever it's

00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:56,070
ready for the team whenever the team can

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,160
take it and go with it

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,380
pluses are your value added time the x's

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,970
are when an item is in that state it's

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,650
not really adding any time so you want

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,410
to get something from those states

00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:09,120
through as quickly as possible and the

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,370
team can look at this and reflect on it

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:19,169
on a day to day basis and then again in

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:21,809
something like a retrospective so

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,700
another thing is we talked about

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:27,120
visualizing our workflow and we talked

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,470
about those little flow units right just

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,720
like how you think twice about driving

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,460
down a road like this your queues should

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,040
also be roadworthy right accidents

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,160
accidents can happen Q hygiene is

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,500
essential to flow efficiency right when

00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,600
you want to put good ideas into action

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,179
as quickly as possible the road needs to

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,950
be clear right you can't go or at least

00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,900
I wouldn't go 60 miles an hour down this

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,490
road and then when it constantly looks

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,640
like something just exploded on the road

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:57,350
you'll waste time as a team navigating

00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,999
around that mess so

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,519
true retrospective format on a high

00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:04,499
level what stayed the same about how we

00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,789
worked right we didn't change everything

00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,379
right there are things that were in

00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:10,049
place they made a lot of sense to

00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:11,399
continue doing right what was great is

00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:13,529
we didn't really spend an extra dollar

00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:16,230
we had everything that we needed already

00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,570
as a team and on the flip side of that

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,360
we did change a few things we switched

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,370
from or continuing to switch from a more

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,039
resource efficiency approach to more

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:30,720
flow efficiency we team members are now

00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:33,029
working to with the work rather than

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,769
being assigned the work and they pull

00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:39,059
work to themselves rather than having it

00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:41,490
be assigned so retrospectives are I

00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:44,700
think one of my favorite pieces about

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,169
working on teams in general right you're

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,210
a team you're trying new things freaking

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,999
out how to work better together what's

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,269
working right and what should change or

00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:56,460
what should we consider changing so

00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:58,259
there's this great text for folks who

00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,909
are interested in you know are several

00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,070
different retrospective activities if

00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:03,629
that's more your way of an icebreaker in

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,090
this type of conversations but you know

00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:07,980
as the team matures sometimes you can

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:11,159
just get right down to it which is great

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,299
and she provides an outline for a great

00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,740
way to do these retrospectives

00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:17,879
especially if the team is new and

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,070
informing so what did we learn quickly

00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:23,210
here to summarize start with what we

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:25,919
have people tools space skills

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:29,119
prioritize our work visualize our

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,820
process limit our work in progress

00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:35,970
hold retrospectives because those are

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,389
how we improve as a team and we focused

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:42,570
on delivering value to customers faster

00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:44,039
by creating slack in our system agile

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,840
and lean these values and principles

00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,460
everything we've been talking about are

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,769
all about experimentation and learning

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,570
there is not a one-size-fits-all model

00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,730
that you can take on one team and

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,460
perhaps deploy to another team just a

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,139
bunch of concepts and ideas and the open

00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:02,879
mind and remaining flexible and to try

00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:05,909
new things and enjoy the trip you know

00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:07,529
if you're right on Friday you should

00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:09,840
join us for some contribution sprints I

00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:14,039
never know if they should go after

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,179
but we gotta listen and I and true the

00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,250
true spirit of what we've been talking

00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,320
about feedback would be greatly

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,270
appreciated I think there's an

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,110
opportunity to do that on the session

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:27,270
page an evaluation ways to things that

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:30,289
were helpful ways to improve this talk

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:33,150
in the future be greatly appreciated and

00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:36,500
now if there are any questions more than

00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,500
happy to talk about things

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,210
yeah so the first thing that we did was

00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,270
we kind of need to take stock of where

00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:55,550
we were and how things were working by

00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,809
visualizing it and then the next thing

00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,780
that became clear is that people had a

00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:04,010
lot of things assigned to them so we

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:05,960
encourage folks to to try perhaps Chris

00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,980
moving one thing at a time and having

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,140
that be the thing that's assigned to

00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,510
them but you're right as a team there

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,550
may be five people on the team so does

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,940
your is your whip limit five use your

00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:19,790
whip limit four or is it six it's really

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,260
just about trying one thing and then if

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,940
folks don't have anything to do because

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,710
you came up with this arbitrary number

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,660
right you can be flexible and change

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:32,800
that so I don't know if that totally

00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,800
spoke to your question in the back

00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,170
where

00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:05,590
on another team perhaps yes so you could

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,299
do well like was that dependency known

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,440
before that task got pulled through or

00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:13,990
is that something that got learned okay

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,600
cool so that that when we've seen that

00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,950
in the past you know you may if it gets

00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,539
pulled well it's not ready I guess it

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,710
does another dependency right that

00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:22,500
wouldn't make sense to pull that through

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,580
isn't kind of leave it hanging out there

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,620
but if you didn't know about it and you

00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,020
learned it you know one of the things I

00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,280
think is important is the flexibility

00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,720
it's like okay well we know what the

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,820
situation is with this one particular

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,190
thing you know we don't like leaving it

00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,770
here right is now the right time to talk

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,140
about why that's still here can we move

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,640
this perhaps we need to represent the

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,840
fact that there's this dependency as

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,159
another column but that the team and

00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,840
you're talking about like organizational

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,990
dynamics right you could be pulling a

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,460
bunch of things through and then

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,140
something just keeps getting stuck so

00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,450
that would definitely be something that

00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,799
I would prioritize as a conversation you

00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,500
know is the person who did that should

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,210
they be part of the team or the person

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,590
who's the dependency if it's a person

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,960
should they be part of the team and help

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,320
remove it and encourage that to move

00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,320
forward

00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:40,070
so that's one of those working

00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,110
agreements that you know when it happens

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,030
the team could talk about hey are we all

00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,200
right with leaving this here right is it

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,850
something that's going to be resolved by

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
the end of the day or is it looking like

00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,630
it's gonna be three months from now when

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,280
someone gets around to resolving this

00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,630
but true to the point of queue hygiene

00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,299
you don't want things hanging out in

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,010
that state for you know an infinite

00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:59,960
amount of time so if it's looking like

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,940
hey we got something to work in progress

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,309
someone did 80% of it and they realized

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,110
oh hey there's this key thing that's

00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:07,659
gonna take three months you know the

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,070
team may decide you know what let's just

00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:12,230
abandon this task right let's just throw

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,090
this into the into the done column but

00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,230
document why we're not doing this

00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,240
anymore

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,520
but again that flexibility to talk about

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,110
hey it's gonna be done tomorrow we're

00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,299
okay to leave it here we're flexible and

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,220
then talk about it that next day and is

00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:27,100
it still there right what do you want to

00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,100
do about it

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
hey

00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,430
yeah

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:08,629
yeah so it sounds like you're in a

00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:10,730
situation perhaps where you continue to

00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:12,889
find yourself taking tasks that maybe

00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,480
they're ready but then when you move

00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,669
them through you find out and you

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,139
realize that they're not ready or like

00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:20,720
there's a dependency that keeps getting

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,300
blocked by something else and is there

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,830
an opportunity that you have to do

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,050
perhaps a quick discovery on that task

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,780
before you move it to in progress would

00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,190
be one thing I'd look into or rather

00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,929
move it to in progress but have it as a

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,099
discovery before it's actually the task

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,109
especially if you continue finding

00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,419
yourself in that situation but perhaps

00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:41,869
also are you alone on this team or

00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:44,030
they're other people on this team okay

00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:45,980
because if there's like one thing that

00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,510
that's worked is if there continues to

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,830
be that same dependency from another

00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,800
person in another part of an

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,089
organization perhaps one idea would be

00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,280
to see if that person could join that

00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:57,740
team just even in the mornings for the

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,140
stand up to help prioritize their day

00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,070
but that takes speaking of politics that

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,670
could take a whole lot in some

00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,670
organizations

00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,410
Oh totally

00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:25,319
yeah it's not a hard fast rule right we

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,089
got to remember that that Dogma can be

00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:28,829
really difficult it could be

00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:30,900
demoralizing to a team right if we

00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:32,880
approach this thing with those hard fast

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,829
rules it's that flexibility that we're

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,910
all humans right and that we're working

00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:36,990
on things the best that we can and

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,690
sometimes we need a little bit of a

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:42,559
break and that's okay right as long as

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,490
we're all talking about it as a team and

00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,720
definitely been in those couple

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,010
different situations like that where

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,869
someone's like hey you know I really

00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,250
want to break ground on this but I'd

00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:52,980
like to wrap up my day with this or

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,900
something like that and you know I think

00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,299
kind of where we were coming from was

00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,010
people had you know there's this one

00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:00,599
joke we used to tell you just a

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,859
scientist this person right because they

00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,599
already have like 90 things assigned to

00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,490
them right this has many many many years

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,470
ago and it just added out of this

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,700
person's list right need at it and the

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,619
person who get an email it's like okay

00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:14,579
one more thing I know I've got job

00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:16,410
security for forever now but it's going

00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:18,990
from thinking about how to help teams go

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,299
from 10 or more things assigned to one

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:28,640
person at any given time to to one or

00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:28,640
two and being flexible yeah

00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:47,349
it's a great question um I'm chuckling a

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,809
little bit because that's exactly what

00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:53,260
we had to deal with that for sure right

00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:55,450
and the be great to talk more about that

00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,859
to kind of sidebar if you'd like and how

00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:59,920
we how we address that but just kind of

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:01,510
high-level is true to the limiting our

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,150
work in progress and working at one task

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:06,700
at a time we found that it made sense to

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,940
have a team work on one project at a

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,559
time

00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,270
but then you have the ongoing support

00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,339
you know you built this amazing Drupal 8

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,569
site you shipped it and now six months

00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,920
later they're you know whatever that

00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:16,569
organization is this back with this

00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,520
feature or this enhancement and you're

00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,230
like oh well the best team to do that

00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,609
right is the team that built it but

00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,980
they're already out of the next thing so

00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:26,619
how do you handle that ongoing support

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,540
so we actually rolled out what we call

00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,250
the SLA team the service level agreement

00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,640
team and they're a team that we don't

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:35,140
schedule on bigger projects so all that

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,549
they do is they have a daily standup

00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,910
where they review all the ongoing

00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:42,640
support requests and a cue system that

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,170
we're working on but I essentially you

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,569
know those things come through that team

00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,480
I think it ranges from three to five

00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:50,619
people at any given time but the key

00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,170
point there is that they're not

00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:55,480
committed to any deadlines on any other

00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,720
projects so when those tasks come

00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,329
through they can pull them through and

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,440
it's kind of its kind of interesting as

00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,630
a business model right because you

00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,299
essentially then may have people on any

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,250
given day and that may not have anything

00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:11,290
to do right but you're building that

00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,700
slack on that team so that when those do

00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,869
those things do come through you can

00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,130
pull them through quickly and you're not

00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:17,859
interrupting someone who already has a

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:20,130
bunch of other commitments you have a

00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:20,130
question

00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,710
there's a lot more than just

00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,339
yeah it's the different different teams

00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,720
you know we like to make sure that

00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:59,650
there's a different amount there's like

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,530
a range of skills it's a

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:05,560
multidisciplinary team so there may be a

00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,599
tester on this team for example someone

00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,700
who can take all these user accepting

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,859
tests these are accepting user

00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,960
acceptance tests and make sure that they

00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:15,490
match the original criteria right and

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,910
then pull those over to ready for deploy

00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:21,040
so I've been thinking about this more as

00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:27,369
a team that has that's fortunate enough

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:29,010
oh right so like what how does the

00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:30,819
person who's working through that queue

00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,030
represent the work that they have in

00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:33,030
progress

00:39:54,370 --> 00:40:01,850
cool that's great and do they switch

00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,020
like when they get the signal that it's

00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,220
ready or do they switch that next

00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:11,840
morning because they're working on

00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:14,150
something yeah I mean that's a great

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,740
question so it could be you know the

00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,090
team could look at this and ask that

00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,680
question and say hey how are you gonna

00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,110
move all these things through and that

00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,610
daily standup perhaps and maybe people

00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:25,370
are going to say hey look why don't we

00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:27,380
as a team get all these out of the user

00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,580
acceptance testing right good to have

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,130
different people testing each other's

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,900
work and get those things are ready for

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:37,300
deploy that could be a conversation that

00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,300
they have in the morning but and then oh

00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,770
I don't know how big this team is right

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,600
so there could be in this example five

00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:46,340
people on this team and two people that

00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,830
morning may say hey in this hypothetical

00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,900
right hey I'm gonna let's let's just

00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,910
crush these you eighty tickets and

00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,940
someone else may say okay well I'm gonna

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,050
pick up this this could be either a pre

00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,060
stand-up or opposed to end up

00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:03,740
representation of this team's work I

00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:05,390
don't know if that are you on this team

00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,440
do you imagine you have your daily

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,330
stand-ups and you're talking about

00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:15,260
things and are you finding that things

00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:17,330
get stuck or oh cool and as a team

00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:23,900
what's the team thinking they are all on

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:26,290
board that idea yeah okay cool any other

00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,290
questions

00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,100
yeah

00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:41,060
so this is just sorry yep on some

00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,620
projects yep so we have some other ways

00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,780
of working and when it makes sense we

00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,040
can do you know those two-week sprints

00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,630
or whatnot with your planning meaning in

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,740
the beginning and your reviews at the

00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,250
end right if we're all familiar with

00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,900
that so perhaps in your planning meeting

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,670
right there could this may not be all

00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,650
the work for the team for the whole

00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,140
project but this is you know just a

00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,670
quick snapshot there may be you know a

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,800
product development team that's working

00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,480
on requirements gathering feedback etc

00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,700
and they're managing things kind of

00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,290
their workflow is out you know they may

00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,250
have a board like this but it's not part

00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,920
of what the development team was working

00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,200
on so in this example in that planning

00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,810
meeting they may review all those tasks

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,960
right and then and obviously as that

00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:23,330
prioritized list and then pull things to

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,500
do and prioritize them there and that's

00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,540
the planning meeting the things that

00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,830
aren't to do and then in the review

00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,540
obviously you have all your things that

00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,740
you're talking about and done but this

00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:36,260
workflow would exist inside the spring

00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:39,140
cool I think those were all the

00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,990
questions thank you everybody

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:47,890
we're doing great on time

00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:47,890
[Applause]

00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:12,970
so yep they said like in this example

00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:15,279
this was maybe an ongoing support team

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:17,650
so the to-do list just all the tickets

00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:19,299
that have come in and then you know the

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,619
team doesn't want the timer the team

00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:24,329
wants the time to start when the ticket

00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:24,329
