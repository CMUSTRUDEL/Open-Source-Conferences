Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Building a Better Authoring Experience
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Nothing brings UX, IA, design, and content strategy to life like launching a shiny new site: teasers fit neatly without any ellipses, images are cropped perfectly for different screen sizes, and related content is wonderfully relevant. But after a few months, things start to slip as ongoing content maintenance and creation steers the site away from its original pristine vision.

In this presentation, we’ll learn how to name and organize fields, and how write help text and editorial instructions that let authors do their jobs well. Most importantly, we’ll talk about how to provide ongoing support for successful structured content, information architecture, and design.

We’ll explore:

The most effective ways to communicate editorial guidelines and rules
How to prioritize which information should be included in the guidelines
How to work with our authorsI've  to build strong content together
