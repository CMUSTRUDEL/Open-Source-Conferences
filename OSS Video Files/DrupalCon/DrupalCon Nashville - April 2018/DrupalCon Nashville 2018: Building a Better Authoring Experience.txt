Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Building a Better Authoring Experience
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Nothing brings UX, IA, design, and content strategy to life like launching a shiny new site: teasers fit neatly without any ellipses, images are cropped perfectly for different screen sizes, and related content is wonderfully relevant. But after a few months, things start to slip as ongoing content maintenance and creation steers the site away from its original pristine vision.

In this presentation, we’ll learn how to name and organize fields, and how write help text and editorial instructions that let authors do their jobs well. Most importantly, we’ll talk about how to provide ongoing support for successful structured content, information architecture, and design.

We’ll explore:

The most effective ways to communicate editorial guidelines and rules
How to prioritize which information should be included in the guidelines
How to work with our authorsI've  to build strong content together

all right we're gonna get started hi

00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,650
everyone my name is Eileen Webb I am the

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,690
director of strategy and livestock at

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,180
Webb meadow we are located on a small

00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:14,830
farm in northern New Hampshire my title

00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,260
is not facetious and I am a Content

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,320
strategist and a consultant and sort of

00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,560
a digital strategist and a recovering

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,940
back-end Drupal developer I wanted to

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,979
start today by taking a moment to

00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,750
acknowledge where we are in the city

00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,310
currently known as Nashville this is the

00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,229
traditional ancestral territories of the

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,630
Chickasaw the Cherokee the Shawnee the

00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:37,630
creek and the Choctaw people's we are

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,119
guests here today I want to talk about

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,680
improving your user experience and not

00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,420
for the people who are visiting your

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,119
site but for the people who are actually

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,590
building your site and so I'm gonna

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,270
start by telling a story and you just

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,280
sort of Nod along when it starts to

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,710
sound familiar

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,690
it goes something like this you launch a

00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,970
new site or maybe you launch like a new

00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:01,960
section of your site and everything on

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,880
launch day looks great and the article

00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,619
titles are just the right length and the

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,810
events and the calendars have all the

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:10,390
relevant information teasers you're

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,900
teasing birds are singing everything's

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:19,150
pretty darn good and then three weeks

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:22,650
pass and you click over to a page and

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,650
you see something that looks like this

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,060
or maybe you've designed a hero image

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:38,900
that looks like this and someone has

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:40,970
created a new one or maybe you open up

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,350
your site on a phone or you look at the

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,740
information that's being fed through the

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:48,140
API and you see stuff like this and the

00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,650
question rolling through your mind at a

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,710
sort of fundamental level is why are you

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,840
breaking my site I worked hard to make

00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,660
this site elegant and performant and

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,340
responsive and you authors you site

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,460
admins you get your grubby little paws

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:07,670
all over it

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:10,610
so why is that what is so hard about

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,920
this so when it's time for someone to

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,810
create a new post or to update an image

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,380
on the home page let's look let's look

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,780
at what they're dealing with oh okay

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,550
wait sorry that that can't be right

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,870
no one here works on a site that makes

00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,790
any of their authors ever touch code

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,260
right we wouldn't do that to them

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,810
certainly not code that looks like this

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,890
oh yeah okay good that's much better

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,380
there's gonna be way easier for people

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,610
to use I definitely my favorite part

00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,480
about putting new content on a website

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,520
is the time travel back to 1996 but I

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:50,060
lean you say my authors do not have to

00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:52,160
work in HTML we have a CMS okay so when

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,590
the first CMS's came along this here

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,760
this was snazzy I mean look at this

00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,230
there's fields there are radio buttons

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,550
look at all the formatting choices in

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,650
the editor there's bold there's

00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,750
underline their font family which you

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,740
absolutely want people choosing

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,660
willy-nilly on a per-page basis there's

00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,430
binoculars for bird-watching there's a

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,040
purple horseshoe

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,250
you're sad man like look at all this

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,359
stuff your authors can do this is great

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,210
Eileen you say this is a Drupal

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,360
conference and also joomla 1.5 came out

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:29,860
in 2006 we're not using that our modern

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,949
CMS experiences much nicer than this

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,630
okay let's see here here's a current

00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,389
version of WordPress looks super

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,160
different I noticed that we have lost

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,870
the binoculars for bird-watching but we

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,610
still have a purple horseshoe here it

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,880
was nice

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:50,960
here's Sitecore here's adobe experience

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,289
manager I apologize from whatever is

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,539
happening in this sidebar here

00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:59,410
here's expression engine starting to

00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:02,330
look a little cleaner well-liked slicker

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,990
okay here's a here's a Drupal current

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,060
Drupal screenshot alright Wow super

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:13,789
unique really different than all the

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,349
other ones what the hell seriously like

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,289
on the front end we've gone all the way

00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:20,120
from like web 2.0 shiny bubble buttons

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:22,490
remember that that time it was a good

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,090
one right through like skeuomorphism

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,220
chalk on chalkboards photorealistic all

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,580
the way into like super flat digital

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:36,770
native design and on the back end we fix

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:42,470
it advanced to a slightly cooler icon

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,789
set in the WYSIWYG so here's my thought

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,340
I think that these two things are

00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:48,590
connected I think that authors do a

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,990
crappy job with this kind of thing

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,880
because we as the developers and

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,180
builders of a site are doing a really

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,610
crappy job with this we talk about user

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,400
centered design but the people on the

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,159
back end use the site more than any

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,630
visitor ever does and how many testing

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,430
sessions do we do with them

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,500
and how many design iterations and

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,440
Sprint's are dedicated to improving this

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,750
monstrosity so I want to talk today

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,580
about improving the authoring experience

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,500
so this is the experience where people

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,990
who are actually authoring content on a

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,750
site it's a huge topic I'm gonna cover

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:27,340
just one narrow slice of it today

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,930
just about writing content guidelines so

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,520
any sort of content creation that

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,550
happens on your site write blog posts

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,200
event listings service offerings product

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,520
pages whatever it is every piece of

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,950
content has its own set of requirements

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,560
right you've got ideal format you've got

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,440
lengths underlying message intended

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,140
audience keywords for SEO all kinds of

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,720
things it's a lot to remember and in

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,880
fact it's actually too much for a single

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,770
human being to remember and so content

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,140
guidelines are the way that we attach

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,690
reminders and help texts to each field

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,169
to each section to each content type

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,210
so that authors can do their jobs well

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,590
and so if we're gonna write content

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,510
guidelines it's important that we

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,130
understand who's going to use them and

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,730
so when I talk about building guidelines

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,140
for authors Who am I talking about

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,850
so perhaps you work at a big

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,890
organization and you have a dedicated

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,840
web team and there are people writers

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,200
usually whose job is specifically

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,080
full-time creating and managing content

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,940
those people are authors or maybe you

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,740
work at an organization that doesn't

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,990
have a dedicated web team and people

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,340
from all over deal with content on the

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,479
site right maybe you've got a number of

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,190
different departments and each

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,110
department sort of manages their own

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,940
content which means that it's really

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,640
only one small part of their jobs right

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:46,870
like maybe like one day every few weeks

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,580
is like web day for them those people

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,750
those sort of occasional site managers

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:55,600
those are authors if you work with a

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,540
site that has a community contributing

00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,070
content whether it is an internal

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,650
community of like interns and volunteers

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,330
or you are managing an external

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,370
community that connects people out in

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,290
the world those people have never had

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,700
any training in how to use your site and

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,110
what's more they're never going to get

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,080
training because that's not the kind of

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,820
relationship they have with you but the

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,720
site doesn't work well unless everyone

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:23,979
follows the same rules and so those

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,979
people are also authors and then there's

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:28,510
you maybe you are an author this one is

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,150
sometimes the hardest sell because

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,430
you're like why would I bother document

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,700
the work that I literally do all day

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,230
every day two reasons one is that you

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,750
might go out hiking and get eaten by a

00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,760
bear who could say and then no one will

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,650
know how to do your job

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,320
two is that you're not really doing it

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,260
for like now you or even for tomorrow

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,270
you you're doing this for like Friday

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,300
afternoon three months from now coming

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,370
down with a cold you who just needs to

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,200
update the press release page but don't

00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,250
remember what size image is supposed to

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,170
go with the press release because you

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,280
don't do it very often and you would

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,100
just really like to go home and take a

00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:09,390
nap you're doing it for that version of

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,920
you so the label author covers a lot of

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,660
people all the way from full-time people

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,940
all the way down tests or casual

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,190
occasional editors and it's pretty

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,410
obvious by casual people and sort of

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,630
occasional users can use extra reminders

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,430
and help but even professional writers

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,720
get distracted and they have bad days

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,960
and they're working on four different

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,950
projects at once so everyone benefits

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,450
from having well written help text it's

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,040
the first step to building good content

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,540
guidelines is to figure out a little bit

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,490
about how structure your content which

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,710
means you need to build a content model

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,970
if you work in Drupal regularly this is

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,060
probably like a pretty normal part of

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,670
the process what is a Content model what

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,110
a structured content there's like a four

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,240
and a half hours I could talk about this

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,160
just right now but I'll give you like a

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,050
few sentences a content model is a

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,330
breakdown of all of your content types

00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,280
and relationships on your site and

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,530
notice that I didn't say all the content

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,990
on your site but all the content types

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,700
so we're not really looking at it at

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,620
what it is that we are saying we're

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,350
looking at the patterns in the way that

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,670
we say it so structured content is when

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,710
you look at a bunch of different pieces

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,630
of content and you break them down into

00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,190
their component parts if you work in

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,720
design systems this will start to sound

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,520
like some of the similar language it's

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,380
essentially the language and information

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:27,510
version of a design system an easy

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,640
example here is a recipe and in fact I

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,020
am federally mandated I am not allowed

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,500
to talk about structured content without

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,600
using recipes as an example

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,430
so if you look at a bunch of recipes

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,110
you'll start to see some patterns so

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,640
this is a recipe for fresh ginger cake

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,380
it's delicious

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,350
this is a real recipe that I use on a

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,640
regular basis if you look at a number of

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,290
recipes in a row you start to see

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,020
patterns right you see the name of the

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,880
cake you see a little description of it

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,040
there is an author up there up in the

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,370
corner this is by David Lebovitz the

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,320
original publication and Epicurious as

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,280
you start to scroll down you see like

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,420
the yield this cake serves 10 to 12 mm

00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,740
questionable like maybe 6 to 8

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,530
especially if you want leftovers for

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,270
breakfast and then we start to see an

00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,310
ingredient list right and you scroll

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,810
down and there's like a bunch of

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,940
ingredients that follow a relatively

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,340
normal pattern then we get to the

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,350
instructions instructions actually have

00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,790
patterns within them as well right

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,230
baking recipes usually ask you to

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,120
preheat the oven

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,800
it usually calls for using a certain pan

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,450
size at the end there's often a

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,210
finishing touch or garnish around

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,130
serving time this is an important thing

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,050
to notice because often we get to the

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,120
point where we see sentences and we just

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,930
sort of our eyes glaze over and we're

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,160
like done block of text but just because

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,630
something is written out in long form

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,210
doesn't mean that you stop looking for

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,860
patterns so don't stop at words look for

00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,420
patterns in the information and see if

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,500
there's repeating patterns across your

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:57,800
content and then we have metadata and so

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,240
metadata is the sort of shorthand I use

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
is that it's information about the

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,680
content rather than information that is

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,750
in the content and so for recipes your

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,920
metadata might be things like categories

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,740
like whether it's breakfast lunch or

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,550
dinner what the cuisine is from whether

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,960
it's beginner or an expert level recipe

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,490
this has tags on the bottom that's a

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,740
common way to represent some metadata

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,590
you'll notice that this cake is both

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,540
good for fall and Mother's Day it's a

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:27,890
year round to ginger cake which I really

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,690
appreciate so figuring out your content

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,690
model is a matter of looking across all

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,310
of your content or at least a good sort

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,780
of sample chunk of your content and

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,900
teasing out some other repeating

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,690
patterns okay I mean this sounds like a

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,400
lot of work let's be honest why are we

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,520
bothering why are we bothering to build

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,510
a content model so content I'll help you

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,949
create really consists

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,779
content because if you show someone a

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,940
blank box like this and you say okay put

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,399
the recipe in here or like put all the

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,230
event information in here

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,600
good luck having two people do it the

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,130
same you know in two different

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,930
departments good luck having one person

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,750
do it the same on two different days or

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,360
even twice in a row whereas if you give

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,370
someone in something like this where

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,199
there's a forum and there's a field and

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,199
each field asks for a separate piece of

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,519
information and each field has its own

00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,190
reminder for what kind of information

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,430
needs to be captured what voice or tone

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,540
or format each field should take now

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,880
we're starting to actually get somewhere

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,529
where you can get consistency writing

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,310
content guidelines for a big giant white

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,750
box like this is almost impossible for

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,760
writing a bunch of little guidelines

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,649
broken down that's a much more

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,370
reasonable thing for you to tackle and

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:47,029
for your users to absorb okay so let's

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:49,519
write some help text yay help text when

00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:51,170
it comes to help text we have to find

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,209
sort of a middle point because you have

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,160
to provide enough information that the

00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,980
author's know what is needed right like

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,720
just a label isn't gonna cut it but you

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,940
also can't give them three paragraphs of

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,470
guidelines on like a single text field

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,680
because they're just gonna skim right

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:09,470
past it without reading so there's a

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,360
balance to be sought here and the the

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,920
thing to prioritize in the balance is

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,949
what is actually helpful and useful for

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,690
your team in particular and this is very

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:20,329
much like it's gonna be different for

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,889
every person in the room the last time I

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:23,149
gave this talk someone was like okay so

00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:26,120
how do you figure out which pieces to

00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:28,220
put in and I was like well I mean one

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,380
thing is that changes over time right

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,630
your your team will grow and learn to

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,399
understand things and and then they'll

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,230
sort of need different help as things

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,850
happen and I would like to be all sort

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,440
of like high-level and philosophical and

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,220
give you some like beautiful guidelines

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,959
about like you know maintaining tone and

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,380
consistency in your marketing copy or

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,910
whatever I have definitely written sites

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,430
where the help text is don't you dare

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,570
put the words click here in this box

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,610
because that's what they needed to hear

00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,589
and they needed to hear it for a while

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,000
until they broke themselves as a habit

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,110
and then we were able to use that help

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,959
text to say something a little more

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,420
interesting but that's a legitimate use

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,800
of help text is to remind people to like

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,640
not do things that are gross in the UX

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,470
so I'm gonna talk about a bunch of

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,649
categories of information that you may

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,930
want to cover in your help text so the

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,850
very first thing is names names give

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,680
contacts rightly what is this and we're

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,940
talking about a recipe or a bag Rafi or

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,399
what

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,230
in Drupal it's really easy to put a

00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,589
description for the content type as a

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,600
whole so on the top of like a new new

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,040
node form or like when you're editing a

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,899
node there'll be like a little paragraph

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,519
of information at the top that can tell

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:43,420
you what the content type is for so like

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,980
especially if you're moving from a

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,200
system where you use to just sort of put

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,760
everything in like a basic page type of

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,399
format and now you're separating out

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,470
news versus press releases versus events

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,860
give people the information they need to

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,390
figure out whether something belongs in

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,250
content type a or content type B like

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,440
does this information for as long under

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,180
events does it belong under lectures

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,779
like what is this content type even for

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,310
give people that information because you

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:11,500
can't really depend on them especially

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,180
as like turnover happens and teams grow

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,470
you can't depend on everyone having been

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,870
in your meetings and just sort of

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,240
knowing that institutional knowledge so

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,360
document that put it in the content type

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,670
description field I always encourage

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,670
people to replace generic field names I

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,459
never want to see title and body on a

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,199
page even when they feel redundant

00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:35,110
calling it something like event name and

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,850
renaming body to event description it

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,769
just helps orient the author it helps

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,240
remind them which content belongs where

00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:45,910
and what it is they're doing on that

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,920
page so editorial is sort of information

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,199
about like what we're saying and how we

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,000
are going to say it so there's a lot of

00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,709
things that fit under editorial so voice

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,240
and tone if you have a voice and tone

00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,160
guidelines in your organization which

00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,230
everyone does and that's fine but if you

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,990
have them and you have like words that

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,419
you want to use in particular reminders

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,910
to use those words any kind of

00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:08,199
underlying messages or things like be

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,790
sure to mention our environmental

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,880
initiatives in any of the things that

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,750
talk about our charlottesville programs

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,100
intended audience

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,510
this is especially helpful if you're

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,850
dealing with subject matter experts who

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,959
write like academic nerds and you would

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,589
like them to write things that normal

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,449
humans can read grammar reminders this

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,160
can be like almost like a format thing

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,590
like this should be in the form of a

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,220
question or like make this a list of

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:36,760
three bullets an information that should

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,140
or should not be included so this is

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,910
something that's especially helpful if

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,130
you're moving from a less structured

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:45,070
system to a newly structured system

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,870
people will often write things in the

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,330
body like in the description of event

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,460
like join us on July 3rd and you can

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,080
sort of remind people like the date has

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,820
its own place to live here like it's

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,530
gonna be like highlighted in the design

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,070
don't put the date in history option

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,750
field same thing with like ok sorry I

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,940
just touched touch the cable I should

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,210
have done that same thing with things

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,040
like people mentioning who the actual

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,240
speaker at an event is it's like if that

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,690
has its own field you don't need to

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,460
duplicate that information here this is

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,410
a really good place and also in the

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,669
description of the content type these

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,559
are really good places where you can

00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:22,450
link to a style guide or a mission

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,730
statement or like sort of supporting

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,740
information on your internet or in your

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,179
sort of Z Drive or wherever that stuff

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,890
lives so next we have format where

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,809
editorial was what is it that we are

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,450
saying this is more like sort of how is

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:40,750
it shaped so we've got things like fuel

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,880
blanks data format so like do you want

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,500
something in inches do you want it in

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,380
centimeters like if you have a product

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:52,059
catalog or when we when we say wait what

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:54,580
does that mean if a field uses HTML tell

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:57,549
people which tags are accepted I worked

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,530
with a client who had a field they had a

00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,640
form essentially we're like regional

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,370
offices could fill out some information

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,760
and put it in and they could style it

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,230
like look back

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,270
styling they could they chose the

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,310
font-family and they could make it pink

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,480
and sparkly and underlined and then when

00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,810
they submitted it huic stripped

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,310
everything but peas which was good and

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,720
appropriate but they didn't tell people

00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,580
that and so they've got all kinds of

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,560
upset information from people saying

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,850
like I tried to put in you know bullet

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,530
lists and links and they all got

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,510
stripped so if you're gonna strip stuff

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,200
like let people know what they're

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:33,270
allowed to use and for things like check

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,390
boxes and select lists how many

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,100
selections are allowed so these things

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,270
it's really easy to say like what we

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,890
should just validate this with

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,620
JavaScript right like this is all stuff

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,380
that could be programmed and some of

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,350
them can be programmed but most content

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,330
in the real world has exceptions right

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,690
like maybe for the most part things

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,220
should be in one category but some

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,140
things legitimately need to be in two

00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,170
categories so you can't limit it to be a

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,320
single category or maybe like field

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:07,470
lengths to like be between 40 and 60 for

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:12,180
the ideal design setup but if it ends up

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,470
being 35 or 61 that's okay too and those

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,540
kinds of things are really really

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,820
obviously hard to validate through

00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,860
hardcore programming through like actual

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,450
strict rules because they're not strict

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,040
you know all these exceptions so you

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,540
could write the JavaScript to validate

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,660
something very complex or you could read

00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,400
like a single human sentence and tell

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,630
people like in these situations pick

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:36,360
three categories in these other

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:39,450
situations pick a single category so

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,550
under images we've got image file format

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,440
and this is again something that like in

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,450
Drupal the default you know tells you

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,380
like which the allowed things are like

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:51,990
pings JPEGs etc depending on how expert

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,520
your authors are working with images

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,320
they might need a little more

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,850
information than that they might need to

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,350
know like they need to go export

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,750
something from Photoshop and use the

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,190
safe to web file or whatever the process

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:07,200
is things like image shape and size if

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,120
you've got a particular if you want

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,790
people to upload something that has the

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,870
particular aspect ratio you should tell

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,070
them because otherwise it's gonna get

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,280
Auto cropped and it will always look

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,150
terrible where and how the image will be

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,710
used is a

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,210
the helpful thing to tell people like is

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,520
this gonna be shrunk down to a thumbnail

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,650
and put in a grid or is this gonna be

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,280
like the huge background header of a

00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,050
page and because we're using structured

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,090
content and reusing things all the time

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,640
in Drupal often a single image will be

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,110
used in a bunch of places and most

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,520
people unless they actually built the

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,500
site themselves or how can I remember

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,170
all of the places off the top of their

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,460
head and so they might always think of

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,630
this is like oh I'm putting this in as

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,610
the header image and you're like oh it's

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,840
also used in three other places and we

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,290
need to make sure to pick an image that

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,650
works for all of those places

00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:57,480
similarly for art direction you know is

00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,760
this is this supposed to be a landscape

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,920
photo of like a big expensive landscape

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,630
should it be a macro photo of food if

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,070
there are people are they looking

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,720
directly at the camera are we breaking

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,760
the fourth wall like is it supposed to

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,110
be an action shot these are the kinds of

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,750
things that actually like help set the

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,650
mood of your design right and the reason

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:18,300
designers take such a long time picking

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,520
perfect photos whether it's stock photos

00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,140
or like doing photo shoots with your

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,660
teams and with your products and things

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,340
the reason that those are so carefully

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,770
crafted is because they do such a huge

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,510
job they carry a really huge burden on

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,590
the site the right photos and so if

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,410
you're gonna give people the ability to

00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,120
change photos make sure you don't also

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,150
sort of give people the ability to kind

00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:43,560
of muck with the entire intent and mood

00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:46,260
of the site and then we've got display

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,390
so where does this content go and again

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,640
this is something that's really

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:53,070
prevalent in Drupal because of the reuse

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,690
and because we do like this some

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,640
particular field might show up in four

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,340
different views right we might show up

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,510
in a sidebar and I might show up in a

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,460
footer and it might show up in teaser

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,770
format and there are all kinds of ways

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,240
that stuff is gonna be used that is not

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,060
necessarily obvious when you're just

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,160
looking at the node edit field on the

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,640
other side of the generic node template

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,080
a thing that's very helpful is to remind

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,300
people if this field is gonna control

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,500
where content will be displayed like for

00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,030
example there's putting something in a

00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,040
particular category I mean it's gonna be

00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,490
pulled over to certain calendars or to

00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,960
different areas of the site will the

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,909
contents of this field be displayed

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,830
alongside

00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,749
other information so if you have like a

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,210
teaser field and a full description

00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:37,340
field do you stack those in the full

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,509
view and so if you said if you said the

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,149
same thing and both of them that would

00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:42,799
be very like duplicative and weird or is

00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:44,450
it sort of one or the other and so they

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,139
can be duplicate duplicate it and that's

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:50,149
not gonna be an odd experience and also

00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:53,570
like water categories and tags actually

00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:55,249
used for those are words that like we

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,899
sort of we know what they mean right we

00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:58,369
know what taxonomy means but what does

00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,889
it mean on your site what does it mean

00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:02,749
in this case is it about browsing is it

00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:05,330
about filtering down a list of results

00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:07,639
are you grabbing sort of related you

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,349
might also like are they only used

00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:12,499
internally right that's something that

00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:14,059
we have often fields that we're tracking

00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:15,759
something internally but it doesn't do

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:18,590
anything on the public side of the site

00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,119
and people need to know that so that

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,379
they sort of know how it is they should

00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,729
be filling in the information in this

00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:29,029
field okay so that's a ton of

00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:30,940
information that you might gather it's a

00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:33,049
lot of bullet points on those slides

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,700
where do you start to get this

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:36,470
information like who should actually be

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,570
involved in creating these content

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:43,279
guidelines where does this stuff live in

00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:45,229
currently so when we talk about who you

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,960
should talk to to start building content

00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:50,330
guidelines designers very good people to

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,950
talk to designers often have a piece of

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,139
a design that they are very protective

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,149
of where they're like look this section

00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,979
over here it is not gonna look good if

00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:59,359
this title gets too long it needs an

00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:01,759
image that has like a bright blue color

00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,220
on the left side in order to balance the

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,309
rest of the page so talk to your

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,590
designers when they are working through

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:11,330
the visual presentation for your pages

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,340
and see if there are things that they

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,570
are concerned that other people are not

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,690
going to be able to sort of keep up to

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,700
the quality that they really want

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,379
similarly the developers who are

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,320
building out the actual features on the

00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:25,879
site I know that when I am building

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,080
sites I often get to a point where I'm

00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:31,549
like does anyone besides me actually

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,609
understand how the categories make

00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:36,590
things show up in the related sidebar no

00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:38,480
no I'm the only person who understands

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,130
okay cool

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,200
the answer is that you're always the

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,910
only person who understands you're the

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,020
developer doing that but you're the only

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,430
person who has wrapped your head

00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,200
entirely around that project because

00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,930
other people blessedly do not have to

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,970
and so it's really important to capture

00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,460
the essence of that into your content

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,590
guidelines so that later on when you win

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,970
the lottery and you're not there anymore

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,440
people will still be able to look at

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,730
that field and be like oh this controls

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,000
the way things show up in the related

00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:08,750
sidebar perfect marketing of course

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,330
marketing has a lot to say about

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,160
everything often but especially the

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,260
editorial aspects of the content right

00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,530
branding messages keywords and phrases

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,320
if you have SEO specific people or even

00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,150
just people who are sort of SEO oriented

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,370
all that kind of stuff like you want to

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,690
make sure that you have gathered any

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,540
requirements from them and that you

00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:32,150
capture them in the content guidelines

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,100
the content team if you have one might

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,250
only be a single person content team

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,980
which is fine the content team often has

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,930
a lot of information tied up in generic

00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,820
job knowledge this is something I

00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,680
encounter a lot with like writers who

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,920
think of themselves primarily as writers

00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,470
and they sort of worked in a CMS because

00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,510
that's how you do writing nowadays and

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,400
they have this huge amount of

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,200
institutional knowledge that they kind

00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,750
of don't even recognize as being

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,300
important they don't even really realize

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,950
how much they know the best look I have

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,420
getting information out of content teams

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,100
is actually shadowing them just like

00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,610
sitting with them for a couple hours at

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,110
their desks and watching them do work

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,780
and having them sort of narrate their

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,190
tasks to me so they'll like be filling

00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,960
something out on the CMS and they'll be

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,850
filling in some field and then they'll

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,770
zip over to some other screen and copy

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,690
something I'll be like wait what was

00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,010
what was that like oh I just copied the

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,750
part number from a manufacturer

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,280
spreadsheet that they spends me and like

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,400
you know then I could have didn't over

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,690
here I'm like a factory spreadsheet on

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,580
the C Drive I'm like you didn't I don't

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:40,280
even know you had a Z Drive like

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:42,480
spoiler alert everyone has a Z Drive

00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,000
until you're furiously scribbling down

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,380
you're like part number Z drive but

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,390
that's the kind of thing that like it's

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,920
so second nature to them like it's

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,060
literally their job just to like do that

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,040
and sort of have all of that knowledge

00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,420
they kind of they would not remember to

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,770
like write it down in a sheet

00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,480
necessarily so it can be really helpful

00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,550
to just sit with them and watch them do

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,290
their work and that can give you a lot

00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,980
of tips on how you could make their work

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,450
better and easier if you are lucky

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,000
enough to work in an organization that

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:12,030
has a legitimate QA department or a

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,610
customer service department those are

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:18,030
great sources of information about

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,950
habitual issues um we tend to know about

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,330
really big issues you write about things

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,150
who are like this is clearly broken

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,770
that's sort of wide knowledge but often

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,540
people like especially in customer

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,920
service they'll be like oh yeah we get

00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,180
calls all the time about people asking

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,560
for shipping weight because that's

00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,950
actually only on half of our product

00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:37,190
listings and like it's their job to just

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,580
answer that for people and so they don't

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:42,600
necessarily think to like let you know

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,530
that the website should have shipping

00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,090
rates for all of the products so talking

00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,890
to these people because their job is

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,420
basically to deal with broken stuff all

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:55,410
the time see if there are broken things

00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:58,080
that you can fix for them so as you're

00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,810
gathering these guidelines the big most

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,820
important thing is to actually build the

00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:09,210
guidelines collaboratively with the

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:12,090
people who are going to use them if you

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,250
take nothing else away from this talk

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,040
take that you should not build things by

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:20,100
yourself that if you're creating a tool

00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,490
for someone else to use we need to build

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,620
it with them and not for them see if you

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,870
can avoid sort of the big reveal right

00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,790
where you build something and you build

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,140
it all completely kind of in silence and

00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,850
in secret and then you would avail it

00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,480
you're like tada I hope you're happy

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:38,220
with this because it feels very terrible

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,510
when you've built something that doesn't

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,870
actually match their needs and they're

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:46,029
like oh thanks that's great I guess

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,289
if it's not really what they needed then

00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:48,850
you just wasted a whole bunch of your

00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,990
time and you built these beautiful

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:55,659
content guidelines and they're like

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:58,000
shrug to be clear if this is not already

00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:00,039
a piece of your workplace culture to

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,260
share things and sort of get feedback

00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,390
when stuff is in a draft format and to

00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,630
sort of work together through messy

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,520
stuff publicly it can be really scary

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:13,059
right putting something out there that

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,580
you know isn't polished can be very

00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:17,919
terrifying you're like I don't want you

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,070
to think that I think this is any good

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,890
yet it's not good yet but maybe we could

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:26,110
work on it together it's it's scary and

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,850
it feels very vulnerable and yucky

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,010
but the ability to adapt and adjust

00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:33,399
something as you are building it is

00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,049
really worth it so know that if you have

00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:39,159
that fear in you of sharing something

00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:41,320
that's kind of gross and ugly that that

00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,690
is a real fair it is a valid fear it is

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,580
not trivial it is not silly but it may

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:50,980
be holding you back from doing some of

00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:52,809
your best work okay so yay we all love

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,630
and understand the value of good content

00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,220
guidelines now good job everyone

00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,870
so you're gonna go back to work next

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,330
week you're gonna spend a bunch of time

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,559
gathering up some information you can

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,510
get all these different sources you're

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,450
gonna have some meetings you're gonna

00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:10,210
feel like you have a really solid start

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:15,240
so how do you get those guidelines from

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,240
your notes into your authors brains

00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,059
maybe you're like yes of course I lean

00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,520
content guidelines we already write

00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:25,870
those we put those in a PDF training

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:28,960
document look I get it

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:30,429
PDFs are easy right you have tons of

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,529
formatting control you can just build

00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:34,000
them on your own you don't need any

00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:38,200
development resources to build a PDF

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,890
screen save as right okay here's the

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,890
thing about PF

00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,350
which kind of belies the whole point I

00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:53,539
don't know if any of you are knitters

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:53,539
out here I'm a knitter yeah yeah

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,830
nowadays you buy knitting patterns as

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,720
PDFs online right and you download the

00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:04,039
PDF and it's all these like knitting

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,240
charts and tables and whatever I

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,259
occasionally so I buy these patterns and

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,659
I download them I keep them in a folder

00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:11,340
on my desktop whatever I occasionally

00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:13,409
will get like an update to a pattern

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,759
like someone will send some author of a

00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,679
pattern will send an update and they're

00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:18,269
like here's a new version of this

00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,649
particular sweater there were three

00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:25,619
sleeves in the medium version the first

00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:27,600
time I don't download the updates if

00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,220
I've already made the sweater and I made

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,740
like a size small and it didn't have

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,549
three sleeves or like I just haven't

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,309
gotten to it yet

00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:37,830
I don't download the new version because

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,570
I'm lazy and a normal human being and so

00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,190
like I don't maintain my own perfect

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,899
library of knitting patterns I just sort

00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,490
of download the ones when I buy them

00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:47,340
which means at some point I'm gonna make

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,269
a three sleeved sweater but this is

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,549
actually like it's a pretty normal

00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,529
behavior people don't go searching for

00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:53,639
the newest versions of PDFs before they

00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:57,749
start things they're like oh I got this

00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:59,730
one right here great perfect so you get

00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:02,519
multiple versions floating around you

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,740
get weird sweaters so PDFs are really

00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,590
like they're not a great way to deliver

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,619
information even setting aside all the

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,909
accessibility considerations like all of

00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:15,240
the things that are not great about PDFs

00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:17,580
so I have a radical idea I think that if

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,580
the content is being entered on a CMS

00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:27,809
form the content guidelines should live

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:31,259
on that CMS form it's crazy but I think

00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:32,940
it could work okay so we all have an

00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,159
appliance in our houses that has a

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,730
button you have no idea what the button

00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,399
does

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,409
I have a microwave that has a button

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,990
that has a cursive Q and the number

00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:45,570
three on it

00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:50,460
I don't know I don't know where does I'm

00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:52,350
not gonna press it safe I could look it

00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,210
up I guess but the manual lives in the

00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,440
manual drawer right which is like in a

00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,870
different part of the house than where

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,080
the microwave is so you don't know what

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:04,230
the curse of q3 is it just sits in the

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,050
middle and taking up space so when your

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,669
authors are writing if the manual is

00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,280
somewhere else right in the proverbial

00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:12,960
manual drawer of the z drive they're not

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,360
gonna go find it the chances are really

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,540
low that they're not gonna go open it

00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,669
and like I get that this is frustrating

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,000
because I feel like if we spend the work

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:26,369
to create content guidelines those

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,990
authors should throw us a party they

00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:30,000
should print out those guidelines they

00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,460
should laminate a set and keep like a

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,190
wallet version just in case they need to

00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:38,129
edit on their phone but they don't do

00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:39,929
that no one has ever actually chosen to

00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:43,230
seek out content guidelines in the

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:45,990
history of the world and so putting them

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,879
in the CMS actually puts the information

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:51,030
right where it's needed right next to

00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,770
the field that they are filling out one

00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,119
of the other pros here is that because

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,590
the instructions are right next to the

00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,570
fields it means you can organize the

00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:00,630
fields in whatever way makes content

00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,010
creation easiest right one of the great

00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,270
things about Drupal is that you don't

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,950
have to have the back end on the front

00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,320
end organize it the same way at all

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:09,720
right you can in your templates you can

00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,070
spit out the information in whatever

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,530
order makes sense for your front-end

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,830
display but the editing screen can have

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:20,010
its own entire set of ordering and

00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:21,630
information and sort of UX treatments so

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,010
maybe you want to group similar fields

00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,270
together maybe you have like a short

00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,590
description in a long description that

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,780
you put in a field group together or

00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,490
maybe you have fields grouped together

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,410
on like how they're gonna be displayed

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,000
so maybe you put like all of the fields

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,060
that show up in the teaser in the same

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,340
section or maybe you've got legacy

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,859
systems that you have to sort of contend

00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,290
with and if you have a manufacturer's

00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:45,119
catalog or some equivalent in your

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,859
organization that gets sent to you by a

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,890
third party maybe you want to make sure

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:52,350
that the fields in your CMS entry format

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,570
sort of matched the order of the columns

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,160
in that spreadsheet so that it's just

00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,290
easy for people to copy information

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,990
back and forth or maybe there's even

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,400
like old paper stuff and you want to

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,900
make sure that it matches so people can

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,940
just sort of plow through the work

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,190
instead of having to sort of pick and

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,530
choose everything fields should be

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:13,320
organized in a way that makes it easy

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,640
for authors to do their work not in a

00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,250
way that makes it easy for us to

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,650
template them in the front end and when

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,500
you customize things in the CMS you can

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,540
also customize the ax which is authoring

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,730
experience I did not invent this acronym

00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,680
but I just use it like it's normal and

00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,420
everyone knows it eventually everyone

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,160
will

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,850
ax authoring experience which is like a

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,320
UX for users or for authors when you're

00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,270
customizing things you can customize

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,960
them for your needs right not for anyone

00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,790
else's needs which might mean like maybe

00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,230
you have a calendar widget for choosing

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,150
the date instead of making people type

00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,220
in a date which is like a lovely easy

00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,620
thing to do in Drupal maybe you have

00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,050
default text so that authors only have

00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,840
to edit a few words if there's a text

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,610
that will work in 80% of your cases

00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,200
maybe you have select lists rather than

00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,390
text boxes or you have places where you

00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,070
have autocomplete fields when we think

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,810
about things like entity reference right

00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,030
you can customize what the autocomplete

00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,650
text says in the entity reference like

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:16,680
customize it to be stuff that's useful

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,180
for your authoring team just pay

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,380
attention to the overall user experience

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:24,060
of your authors like this microwave here

00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,690
this microwave has a button for grilled

00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,690
cake

00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:36,130
my microwave has a potato button I love

00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,440
potato button I have a deep and personal

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,180
relationship with potato button but this

00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,180
audience doesn't need potato right this

00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,739
audience needs grilled cake

00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:49,180
there's also healthy baby I feel like

00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:50,950
that's probably baby food let's be clear

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,779
there's nutrient soup

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,150
there's fish but you should never put in

00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:56,769
a microwave let's be honest but this is

00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,359
like this is a customized interface

00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:00,489
right this is an interface that works

00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,109
for the cuisine of the people who are

00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:04,299
heating this up there's no potato button

00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:06,099
on here so I'll be completely lost but

00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:11,170
if I need a grilled cake this is where

00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:13,569
it come my last Pro here about

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,559
displaying help text in context is that

00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:17,109
you don't have to worry about people

00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,210
using old versions right you don't have

00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:21,190
to worry about people having some

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,190
version that mentions a program that has

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,719
since been renamed or like you know sort

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,539
of mentioning an executive who's no

00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,190
longer with the organization anytime you

00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,190
decide to change anything on a global

00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:36,369
level you can put in reminders right in

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,619
the CMS so that people sort of can't

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:40,269
really ignore them a great thing about

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:43,499
Drupal if you did not already know this

00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:46,450
you can put HTML in the help text fields

00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:47,859
so you can put in spans and you can put

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,719
in all kinds of things you could put in

00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,410
lists right you gotyou ELLs and all

00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,880
kinds of stuff

00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,279
you can't go crazy because it's like

00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,190
it's still gonna sort of just displayed

00:38:54,279 --> 00:39:01,479
beneath the field but you can definitely

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:03,249
put in sort of some basic formatting and

00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:04,539
in the same way basic formatting helps

00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:06,430
users on the front end and the basic

00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:07,930
formatting helps users on the back end

00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,160
so you can put in some spans and things

00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,630
like that and then add some lines to

00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,910
your CSS and all the sudden that have

00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,680
like you know some colors and some icons

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:18,460
and just things that make it a nicer

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:21,009
experience for people the one light

00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:24,099
downside to putting information in the

00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:26,710
CMS is that you might probably require

00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,999
some development resources it's not a

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,619
bad thing inherently but you're gonna

00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:32,349
need her help that can be a roadblock

00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:34,089
sometimes because if you need developer

00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,680
help to make it work depending on the

00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:38,299
structure of your organization you might

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,859
need you know budgeting and

00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:42,829
sourcing and project management and all

00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:45,859
that kind of stuff as you know and

00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:48,589
Drupal putting in per field help texts

00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:49,939
very easy right you just if you haven't

00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:51,679
done it before you maybe need someone to

00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:54,920
show you how to do it make sure you have

00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:57,499
the right permissions but then it's very

00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,170
straightforward a lot of the most

00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:01,130
effective authoring experience

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,160
improvements are gonna be things like

00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:07,459
light UX customization like creating

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,229
sidebars or creating collapsing you know

00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:10,939
field areas and field sets and things

00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:14,569
like that and that might take a little

00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:16,759
bit more than a site admin sort of knows

00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:19,429
how to do off the bat and so that might

00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:21,319
take a little bit of developer time and

00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:23,029
so that's that's really the only

00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,619
downside is that like it might take a

00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:26,660
little bit of developer sort of

00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:30,949
brainpower to make sure that the sort of

00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:32,869
full realization can can happen so you

00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:33,739
might be like thanks Eileen this is

00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:35,539
really great

00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:37,489
next time I'm redoing my site from

00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:40,039
scratch I win a great help text right

00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:41,749
into those edit forms but over here in

00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:44,479
the real world I already have a site

00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:47,719
does not have these things what am I

00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:49,279
supposed to do I actually think that

00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:51,949
when we're doing problem solving there

00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:53,630
is a true fundamental value in

00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,939
understanding and sort of believing in

00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,589
the ideal end state even if it's not

00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:59,779
that's something that we can't quite get

00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:02,179
right now because if we know what we're

00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:04,219
aiming for it is easier to choose

00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:06,439
solutions that sort of take us along

00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:10,249
that path so what does that look like

00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:13,249
for content guidelines bare minimum if

00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:15,589
you do nothing else you can put a link

00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:18,949
to your content guidelines in the top of

00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:20,359
your content editing screen this might

00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:21,949
involve a developer if you don't know

00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:24,019
where the content type description field

00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:26,929
is it's like five minutes of developer

00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:29,239
time this at least means that if you

00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:31,699
have a PDF somewhere that like your

00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:33,619
authors will have a direct easy link to

00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:35,779
content guidelines and to voice and tone

00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:37,369
things without having to search them

00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:39,559
outright it'll just be a link on the top

00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:42,469
of every single edit screen so that's

00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:46,239
like some perfection but its progress is

00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:49,459
worth doing if you can do a little more

00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:52,090
ditch the PDF get your guidelines into

00:41:49,459 --> 00:41:53,920
HTML right PDF is a very unten

00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,680
way to keep a living document and

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,000
contact guidelines are a living document

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,560
it's really nice to know that everyone

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,840
ours always has the most updated version

00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,610
the easiest way to do that is to have

00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,010
them be on a live website somewhere in a

00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,840
single place if you have an intranet

00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,970
right you might be able to create some

00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,400
pages for your guidelines there and then

00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,710
just link to them you can also create a

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,600
page in Drupal and like leave it

00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,700
unpublished that is your content

00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,470
guidelines and so then authors will be

00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,450
able to see it because they can see

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:26,080
unpublished work but it won't be public

00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:29,020
on the site is that super hacky yes it

00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,720
is does it kind of work anyway yeah

00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,250
pretty much does like it's not great

00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,680
it's not beautiful I would not recommend

00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,600
it as like a profound long term solution

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,400
but it's a pretty good way to get

00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,430
content guidelines into a single place

00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,760
canonical spot for the guidelines link

00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:49,050
to - right from inside Drupal it's gross

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,270
but it works it's my motto

00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:54,190
and then third keep talking with your

00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,980
team write check in regularly with the

00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,840
designers and the developers like I said

00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,910
like three weeks after launch check in

00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,230
with people and be like are you offended

00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,120
by something you see on our site

00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,740
currently like has someone uploaded a

00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,290
picture that is terrible or put in

00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,450
titles that are completely wrong if

00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,980
there are places where they notice

00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,840
things that bother them see if there are

00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,790
tweaks you can make to the guidelines to

00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:19,330
help prevent those problems happening

00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:22,030
again sit with authors and editors and

00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,860
say like what's confusing here like if

00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,180
you sit with someone filling out a new

00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,530
note form and they're like well I don't

00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,070
know what this field is so I always just

00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,070
check be

00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,860
they're never gonna remember to tell you

00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,560
that because they just are sort of

00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,150
breezing past it but having people sort

00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,260
of narrate their own tasks can really

00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,600
help you find places where you're like

00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,010
oh you're right that's a terrible label

00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,250
for that field we're gonna change this

00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:48,100
so it makes more sense and then also

00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,440
check with QA right I was QA silently

00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,280
fixing stuff that you didn't know needed

00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,320
to be fixed

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,880
depending on how your QA you sort of

00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,860
culture works if you have one

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,890
sometimes QA fix the stuff and then just

00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:01,750
is like I did my job at fix things and

00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,310
if they don't sort of feed it back to

00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,080
earlier in the loop they're just gonna

00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:10,360
keep fixing those little things broken

00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,950
over and over again so I used to think

00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,750
that it was inevitable I used to think

00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,880
that a few months after launch I would

00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:18,490
sort of be guaranteed to find kind of

00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,730
misused fields and confusing headlines

00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,560
littering a site that particular kind of

00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,450
chaos that comes from combining a really

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,540
powerful CMS with untrained site

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:30,520
administrators but as I've moved my

00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,860
content guidelines into the CMS itself

00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:36,070
my post-launch check-ins have been like

00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:38,190
less annoyed grumbling and more places

00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:40,660
where I can just make small improvements

00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:43,120
when we embed instructions where they

00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:45,160
are relevant and helpful and in context

00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,260
we help our authors build good habits

00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,970
we're also helping them build confidence

00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,920
that they have a sense of how this site

00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:53,140
works and what it is doing for the

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,480
organization we allow them to maintain

00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,880
and maybe even to start expanding a

00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,910
complex site without feeling really

00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,370
really overwhelmed a website that looks

00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:05,320
perfect on launch day is a cool and

00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,420
great thing but when we improve the

00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,400
authoring experience I believe that we

00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,380
can improve the content forever and I

00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,550
find that personally a whole lot more

00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:17,230
satisfying I am Eileen Webb I'm the

00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:19,510
director of strategy and livestock at

00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,650
Webb meadow I am a hireable consultant I

00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,620
will come and yell at your team's about

00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,150
authoring experience anytime you want

00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,560
and I would love to take questions

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:30,130
because I love talking about this stuff

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,780
because I'm a nerd and you can ask me a

00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,400
question and I'll pee into the mic or

00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:37,050
you can stand at the microphone because

00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,050
we're recording so yes

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,160
yep

00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,910
so the question is how do you deal with

00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:06,740
essentially different levels of

00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:08,960
experience and some people who want to

00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,549
like be really controlling of things and

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,279
some people who are happy with the site

00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:18,829
you set up for them and sort of how do

00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:21,289
you just be at them yes always I think

00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:23,990
there's a especially if there's a team

00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,009
involved I would usually lean on sort of

00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,750
the idea of creating something

00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:28,880
sustainable that works for the team

00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,519
overall that it's not just you it's that

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,410
it needs to work for you and also for

00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:35,240
Sharon over here in this department and

00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:38,809
for Alex over here in this department

00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,609
and for people in the future and if

00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:43,160
they're enthusiastic about like wanting

00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:44,599
to do code stuff like because that's

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,799
like you know that's a place where they

00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:47,240
get a sense of confidence about their

00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:49,970
ability and their jobs which is a thing

00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,930
that should be respected and revered see

00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:53,359
if you can put them on doing

00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,869
improvements like on ax improvements if

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,839
someone's like gung ho about templating

00:46:55,869 --> 00:47:02,119
making given ax template power like it's

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,400
a good place to sort of test things out

00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,660
and make stuff better in a way that

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,130
feels kind of profound and people are

00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,839
like oh my gosh this is so much easier

00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:12,230
than it used to be and that feels really

00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:15,039
good without having to sort of bend over

00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,039
to one person's whims

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,130
early twenties

00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,700
yeah I mean there are definitely some

00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,460
times people who I would caution against

00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,930
attaching those things to age my mom

00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,730
programmed punch cards when she was in

00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,260
college and so like she's good with all

00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:56,610
this stuff and she's way older than I am

00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,810
but like but like but I mean that feels

00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,340
to me like a management thing overall

00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,840
like people have to learn to adapt to

00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,250
the way these things work for the better

00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:05,180
of like the betterment of the whole team

00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,350
not just for their own workflows yes

00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:10,140
this is a great presentation I

00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:11,310
appreciate it I realized about

00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,010
three-quarters of the way through this

00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:16,530
project I'm working on kind of migrating

00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:18,690
from SilverStripe does anybody familiar

00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,790
with SilverStripe mm-hmm

00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,380
so it was essentially like a big WYSIWYG

00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,720
and everybody just put their content in

00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,570
there and so I I wanted to make

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,940
structured content to make it easier so

00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,290
the need is there because there's so

00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,440
many different fields but one thing that

00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:37,320
I've noticed that helped me is using the

00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,910
mark-up module Drupal 7 in Drupal 8 it

00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,970
was like a beta version in Drupal 8 and

00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:45,480
you can embed markup within the edit

00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:47,940
field and so I made some images that

00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,620
sort of showed where if you if you put

00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,990
something here this is how it's gonna

00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,580
render on the page and that's really

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,500
proved to be helpful for some that

00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,900
content authors yeah I have also done

00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,740
things where using just like a little

00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,540
bit of CSS and just like a few spans

00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:05,700
essentially put little tiny screenshots

00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,960
of look this is gonna be a header area

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,400
or like this is gonna be a feature

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,480
article therefore it's gonna show up in

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,940
this thing over here and it's just

00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,650
people tend to be pretty visual in their

00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,360
work and so anything you can do that's a

00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,910
great tip anything you can do to help

00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,800
people sort of just get a more holistic

00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:21,750
sense of how the site works the site's a

00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,090
system right and so often we're working

00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:26,160
in a narrow piece of the system anything

00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:27,870
we can do to help people get a broader

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,390
sense of the sort of systemic

00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:35,400
implications of their work I think needs

00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:39,620
to a stronger site thank you do you have

00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:43,400
any advice for when the in context

00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:47,070
content guidelines are regularly ignored

00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,740
because I have one one thing one field

00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:51,280
where I actually have there do not put

00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:55,590
this here and

00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,590
regularly it's like we'll put this here

00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:05,140
how humans adorable I mean so that feels

00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,270
to me like a people problem rather than

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,760
a tech problem right like there are

00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,080
times there are times when it is great

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,340
to be able to just like type something

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,590
into a field and have people start

00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,840
paying attention which bully for all of

00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,280
us we get to do that sometimes more

00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,690
realistic I think is sometimes where you

00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,370
need to do a little bit of culture

00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,620
adjustment and a little bit of sort of

00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:26,050
training and whether that means putting

00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,680
in sort of an extra governance step to

00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,060
like I hate the man I hate but all the

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,100
analogies that pop in my head are all

00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,960
dog training because that feels terrible

00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,540
to me but like the idea of sort of

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,820
reinforcing positive things and and sort

00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,650
of giving people like a light ding when

00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,540
you're like ooh remember how oh no click

00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,360
here on this one we're not putting click

00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:48,160
here in this field anymore

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,640
you know like it feels to me like if

00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,780
people are regularly ignoring something

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,310
there's a problem behind the problem

00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,100
right there's there's a reason they're

00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:59,050
ignoring it and and that's the thing to

00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,780
solve this is an unfortunately a

00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:05,070
situation where training is impossible

00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:07,570
because it's our broader user group

00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:09,280
there are also places where depending on

00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:11,500
your development resources if it's

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,180
something that is if it's something as

00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,650
simple as click here or people putting

00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,630
dates where they shouldn't or something

00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,730
like that you could do a little light

00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,590
JavaScript validation that just for a

00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:22,300
couple months that like highlights a

00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:24,700
field read when people put bad stuff in

00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,070
you know like just that kind of stuff to

00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,050
sort of break habit and make people pay

00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:33,870
attention anew instead of just doing

00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:36,130
rope what they used to do by habit um

00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:39,340
from the perspective of a site owner

00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:41,920
works a lot with contractors on web

00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,200
projects what you have any tips for kind

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,210
of how to make express all this in terms

00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,100
of requirements so I feel like we have

00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,170
been sort of trying to make this happen

00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,690
and we say something like really good

00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:54,820
authoring experience and then you know

00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,900
projects happens and stuff happens and

00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,670
that's always kind of something that

00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,960
people think up at the end and right

00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,190
then you're behind schedule and

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,049
everybody's tired of working with each

00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,849
other and we're

00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:06,839
barely making it across the finish line

00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:08,219
to the lakes people how are you what's

00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:10,380
the best way to make sure it really

00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:12,419
happens so one thing is definitely to

00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,209
start talking about it right in the very

00:52:12,419 --> 00:52:16,949
beginning and this takes sort of

00:52:15,209 --> 00:52:18,689
diligence on someone's part who cares

00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:20,249
about this is to just bring it up over

00:52:18,689 --> 00:52:21,659
and over again much like accessibility

00:52:20,249 --> 00:52:23,909
right like this is the thing that helps

00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:26,249
people and we have to put attention on

00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:28,409
it that when even when discussions come

00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:31,589
up like sort of early in like feature

00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:33,779
meetings like think about okay well what

00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:34,919
if someone uses that feel wrong or like

00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,789
how are we going to make sure people

00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:38,399
understand the difference between

00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:39,959
category and tag or the difference

00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:43,199
between using a taxonomy here and using

00:52:39,959 --> 00:52:46,469
an entity relationship here I feel like

00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,779
there's a there's a little bit of we

00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:50,130
devalue this work generally and so it

00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:52,199
gets pushed way to the end and then it

00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,519
gets done crapoly and then we're like

00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,929
well it wasn't even worth it and so then

00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,109
we don't sort of prioritize it again in

00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:59,489
the next project so also making explicit

00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:01,709
that you want a couple weeks in the

00:52:59,489 --> 00:53:03,839
schedule just like you want an entire

00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:06,689
sprint for this or you want to make sure

00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:08,009
that like you actually have and you

00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:09,779
might just start with like I want to

00:53:08,009 --> 00:53:11,819
make sure we have three one-hour

00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:14,429
meetings in the weeks leading up to

00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:16,289
something where developers

00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:17,849
sit with our authors and the authors say

00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:19,619
what's confusing about the interface and

00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:21,929
developers like when we work together to

00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:23,519
collaborate to find a better solution so

00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:24,959
just sort of like building in some very

00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,599
like structural things we need some

00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:28,949
meetings about this we need to put time

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,359
in the schedule for this right from the

00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:36,630
beginning so that it doesn't get shoved

00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:38,969
to the end yeah hi if you have the

00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,319
benefit of working with your editors on

00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:42,569
the system that you're planning to

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,219
replace which may be completely

00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:48,089
different than the system you intend to

00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:52,409
build them what are some tips or ways

00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:55,589
that you have of getting information out

00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:57,299
of them from from that experience of

00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:59,099
what they're building so you don't end

00:53:57,299 --> 00:54:01,199
up making the same mistakes right right

00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:03,149
there's a there's a bit of a sort of we

00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:04,829
don't know what we don't know there and

00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:06,209
also people they just sort of want

00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:07,259
something lightly better than what

00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,260
they've been using and they don't

00:54:07,259 --> 00:54:09,940
necessarily realize

00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:12,820
be massively better than what they've

00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,490
been using um treat it like a true UX

00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:18,160
research project like do user testing do

00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:20,440
use your research show them a bunch of

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:24,250
pages and the nice thing about this is

00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:26,740
that like this is not this is not not UX

00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:30,100
right it's just UX it's just you X on

00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:31,870
the other side of the site and so all of

00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:35,680
the things that people talk about form

00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:36,940
design on like like gov dot UK and the

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,950
Australian Government have some really

00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,580
great information about form design like

00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:42,520
out there

00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:44,020
all that stuff applies and so treat it

00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,240
like it's treated like you're building a

00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:48,490
whole other website and do some research

00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,490
and do some brainstorming and show

00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:53,560
people front ends of sites and and all

00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:55,630
kinds of things and you know show the

00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,250
reforms on gov dot uk' and say like

00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:59,200
would it be helpful if you had something

00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:02,320
like this like give them some sense of

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:05,350
what the possibilities are so that you

00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:07,090
can start to sort of break them out of

00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:10,110
the mold of like what they have been

00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:13,480
used to thank you

00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:18,190
thanks so much it's been a great talk my

00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,750
question is about how if you have a lot

00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:22,780
of different authors that have both

00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:24,730
different levels of experience but also

00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,350
different needs in terms of what they're

00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,780
going to use the different content types

00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,880
for some of them might just want the

00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:32,790
very basic feel some of them want to do

00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,700
more robust and complex things with them

00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:40,000
how do you manage having high-level help

00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:42,370
text and then more complex advanced

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,150
things knowledge base any tips that you

00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:49,000
have the if you have like mad

00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:52,990
development resources and like an

00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,480
enthusiastic executive you can do

00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:57,370
multiple templates right a single node

00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,960
edit can have multiple templates the

00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:00,580
same way a single node can have multiple

00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,920
front-end displays you can have multiple

00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,020
edit displays there's like definitely

00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,210
like super developer resources available

00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:10,090
to maintain that and create those you

00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:12,310
can also sort of like fake that right

00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:14,380
with like field groups and with some

00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:16,840
tabs and with some sidebars and

00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,430
essentially have a default view that is

00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,460
pretty straightforward and then

00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:23,290
like you know expand this field group

00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,880
and see a number of more advanced fields

00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,910
behind it

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,460
I would I would almost start there with

00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:32,680
just making things lightly more sort of

00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:35,079
complex and layered and see how people

00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,880
respond to it and then sort of iterate

00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:38,650
from there and see if eventually it gets

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,290
worth it to do something like a whole

00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:55,990
separate tabbed you know interface with

00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:58,200
multiple edit forms thank you oh man

00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:00,280
that's a good question

00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,720
like all things with multilingual

00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,040
website so the question was if there are

00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,750
additional steps for multilingual

00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:09,609
websites I feel like this is kind of a I

00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,230
feel like with multilingual websites you

00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:13,450
just have to do everything in every

00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,890
language like you if there are three

00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,869
languages you're building three separate

00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:19,839
admin sites and that's like the most

00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:21,670
realistic way to approach it so that's

00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:25,119
if we're talking about multilingual

00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,710
editors if you're talking about having a

00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,290
single team of editors working on a

00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,450
multilingual front-end it's again like

00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:33,369
treating it like a real UX project right

00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:35,200
you have really complex intersecting you

00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:37,559
have sort of like an octopus of needs

00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:42,130
like all layered and sticky and weird

00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:44,559
and treating it like giving it the legit

00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:46,839
like research and testing phases because

00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,760
you're building something so complex see

00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:50,349
if it works for people and then sort of

00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,180
be willing to adjust I would say like

00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:55,150
build a little thing see if it works

00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:57,339
build a little things if it works rather

00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:59,319
than trying to like fix the problem

00:57:57,339 --> 00:58:04,930
because you might build something not

00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:07,960
helpful if you go too big at once hi

00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:12,510
there I'm wondering if there ever any

00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:16,329
areas of content that you conclude are

00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:19,420
too important to be left to authors and

00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:22,839
I have some very specific in mind which

00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:25,630
is tags I got a system we're putting in

00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:27,339
tags if I let authors and her tags I'll

00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,880
end up with 10,000 tags and it'll be

00:58:27,339 --> 00:58:31,390
useless

00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,700
yes absolutely that is a legit problem

00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:36,309
and I'm like yeah I think that happens

00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:39,160
all the time if you have especially if

00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:41,319
you've got authors who are maybe a more

00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,809
like a community group right you might

00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:46,269
have like a thousand authors but the

00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:48,940
taxonomy of the site requires like

00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:51,460
tightly controlled vocabulary for it to

00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,839
be functional I think that's fine like I

00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,730
think that's a completely that's

00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:56,680
essentially just separating out like

00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,720
what is needed for the site to function

00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,170
versus like what are the things that our

00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,339
authors want to need to express and

00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:05,529
what's the information they're trying to

00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:07,029
share you might like with something like

00:59:05,529 --> 00:59:09,279
that specifically you might see if

00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:11,259
having a controlled vocabulary so you

00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:14,849
control the vocabulary but authors get

00:59:11,259 --> 00:59:16,839
to choose from the the list of things

00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:18,609
that could be one thing that works it

00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,109
really depends on the use case right but

00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:22,930
I also think it's completely fine to

00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:25,930
have things that that basically some

00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:27,339
people don't get to touch the trick

00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:30,369
there is to make sure that there are

00:59:27,339 --> 00:59:32,829
resources on your end the - like if

00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:34,809
someone needs to tag every post then you

00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:39,579
have someone who's like staffed and paid

00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:41,980
whatever to tag every post do you have

00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:44,049
any tips or experiences about managing

00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,750
content in a content as a service

00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:48,789
environment or model where it's not tied

00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:52,089
to a website but tied but can be used

00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:53,650
across multiple digital channels in

00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:55,450
terms of what tell me more about like

00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:57,880
what the tell me what about the problem

00:59:55,450 --> 01:00:00,039
you're facing um so we're repeating

00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,480
content across digital channels so we're

01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:04,210
trying to centralize that in one place

01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,460
and then reuse that with only one

01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:07,869
approval cycle one review cycle and you

01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,849
want to make sure that like the content

01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:13,210
itself is like sort of written to work

01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:16,390
in a bunch of places so that's mostly

01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:18,309
like that's less a technology problem of

01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,900
how to communicate it and more to figure

01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:23,049
out like what are the actual guidelines

01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,789
you need to communicate if you think if

01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:26,019
you're thinking just like the simplest

01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:27,700
sort of example that pops into my head

01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:30,250
is like we're making something that

01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:32,470
needs to work on Facebook and on tumblr

01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:34,359
and they have like lightly different

01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:37,809
requirements for what sort of the ideal

01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:40,359
format is you need to find what the

01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:40,960
middle ground is like define what it is

01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:43,270
that you

01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,790
you need for it to work sort of what the

01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:47,680
ideal piece of content would be a thing

01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:49,900
that I think is super helpful

01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,490
in many contexts is to give people an

01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,160
example of what the correct way of doing

01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:56,020
things is right and that might need to

01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,660
be a separate PDF or like something like

01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,820
that if it is if it's a large enough

01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:03,099
piece but even within a field if you can

01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:06,160
give people a really solid example of

01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:07,450
like here's the ideal state that can be

01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,290
a really useful thing for people to sort

01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:28,530
of model off of alright thanks everyone

01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:28,530
