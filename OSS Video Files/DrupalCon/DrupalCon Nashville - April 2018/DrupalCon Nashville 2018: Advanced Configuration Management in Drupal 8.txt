Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Advanced Configuration Management in Drupal 8
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	In Drupal 8, Configuration Management is part of Core rather than relying on the Features module. However, in practice there are still many challenges remaining:

How to manage environment-specific or multi-site configuration (Config Split)
How to install sites using pre-defined configuration (Config Installer, Core patches)
How to create reusable configuration "templates" (Config Actions)
How to override configuration (Config Override vs Config Actions vs settings.php)
How to switch from a "Features-based" workflow to a more standard D8 config workflow.
This session will go through all of the above topics and discuss the various modules that are useful for managing configuration and give examples of real-life use-cases where these modules are needed.

Some basic knowledge of the Configuration Management system in Drupal 8 will be useful, but a brief overview will be provided at the beginning of the session.
