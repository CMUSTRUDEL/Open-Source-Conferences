Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Women in the Tech Workplace
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	Women in tech - it's been a hot-button issue for quite some time. Are there enough women in tech? It seems pretty clear the answer is no. In a culture of harassment, booth babes, and tech bros, what can companies do to fix things within their own ranks?

Why do some companies seem to have no issue recruiting and retaining female employees when others struggle? What attracts women to tech companies? What repels them and makes them less likely to respond to a job posting? What affect does striving for meritocracy have on diversity?

We'll talk about the myth of the "pipeline problem," address policies and benefits that may be more inclusive such as childcare and leave, your company culture and how it is perceived, and more things specific to the tech world, including things that have worked very well for some companies.



This talk is for everyone - business leaders, those who recruit and hire, those who are recruited and hired, and those who want to know more about what is going on in the tech world today and how to fix it.

hey everyone welcome this is women in

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,540
the tech workplace I'm Ilana Burke I

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:21,289
work for chromatic you can find me

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,289
online on Twitter drupal.org and github

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,689
so these are three of my guinea pigs and

00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,029
I named them after three really

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,340
important women in computer science

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:37,110
their names are Ada Hedy and Jean and

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:42,719
those women were here long before any of

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:44,879
us Ada Lovelace Hedy Lamarr and Jean

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,850
Bartik were some of the early pioneers

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,890
of computer science women have been a

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,680
part of this industry since its birth

00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:01,530
women aren't new to the tech world we've

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,920
always been here so why are we still

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,729
struggling to fit in and succeed in the

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,729
tech workplace

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:15,630
once upon a time computing was seen as

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,820
women's work programming was seen as

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,759
similar to running a telephone

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,549
switchboard in the first half of the

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,189
20th century programmer had a negative

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,530
connotation computers involved a lot of

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:32,130
manual labor when you see those old

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,860
paper time cards or cards that people

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,270
had to punch men didn't want to do that

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,020
they thought it was secretary work so

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,149
what happened well the industry exploded

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,630
by the 1960s there are more jobs than

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,549
programmers to fill them two male

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,549
psychologists William cannon and Dallas

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,409
Perry were hired to find recruits who

00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:01,890
would enjoy programming so they profiled

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:05,969
1378 programmers and only 186 of them

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:09,179
were women they came to two conclusions

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,330
the first was the people who liked

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,450
programming enjoyed solving problems

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,810
the second and problematic conclusion

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:21,860
was satisfied programmers don't like

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,800
people that personality test became

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,760
widespread and created the stereotype we

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,620
still have today which excludes women

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,640
this test me the reign of the Nerds a

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,040
self-fulfilling prophecy the industry

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,080
self-selected for anti-social

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,270
mathematically inclined males that

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,420
created the perception that programmers

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:49,880
should be antisocial mathematically

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:53,030
inclined males so what happened to women

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,340
in computer science this graph from NPR

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,739
shows that there was a peak around

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,470
nineteen eighty four and then a really

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,510
steep decline around that time there was

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,060
a huge demand for computer science

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,450
classes so universities like Berkeley

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:12,410
and MIT started restricting admission to

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,110
students only those with a 4.0 major in

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,730
it but only those with a 4.0 could major

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,880
in electrical engineering or computer

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,700
science these barriers to entry push

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,430
them even more women away computer

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,130
science became not only nerdy but

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,989
elitist the only way to become a

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:36,799
programmer was to already be a

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:39,049
programmer by 2001 to 2002 only 28% of

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,340
all undergraduate degrees in computer

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:48,920
science I went to women by 2004 to 2005

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,750
the number had declined to only 22% data

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,079
collected by the computing Research

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,530
Association showed even fewer women at

00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,739
research universities like MIT women

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,360
accounted for only 12% of undergraduate

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,250
degrees in computer science and

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,290
engineering in the United States and

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,090
Canada granted in two thousand and two

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:17,090
thousand 2006 to 2007 down from 19

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:19,849
percent in 2001 to 2002 many computer

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,580
science departments report the women now

00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,660
make up less than 10% of the newest

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,970
undergraduates

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,600
I know that when I was in school from

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:35,480
2004 to 2008 I was often the only woman

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,310
in my computer science classes so why

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,860
did this happen we talked about the

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,750
pipeline a lot a lot of people blame the

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,270
pipeline they say there aren't enough

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,100
women in tech there aren't enough women

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:51,580
graduating there aren't enough women

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,580
applying but is that the root cause

00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:57,650
women need to see other women in tech

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,600
careers to want to sign up it's not

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,090
enough to just get girls into computer

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,520
science and coding classes there have to

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,010
be successful visible role models in

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,770
tech I know that I was interested in

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,990
computers all throughout high school but

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,210
I thought it was a thing that weird

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,680
nerdy guys did I never thought it was

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,930
something that I could do or that I

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,330
wanted to do or that I would be

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,110
successful doing or I thought I would

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,950
just be too creeped out by the nerdy

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,620
stereotypical guys in the computer

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,630
science department and then I had a

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,380
really amazing role model I had an

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:36,340
amazing faculty member who I had in a

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,810
basic class that I had to take who took

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,600
every female student under her wing that

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,520
she possibly could and said look I am a

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,070
successful woman in computer science and

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,200
you can be too and she was really

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,120
successful at that and we loved her and

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,310
I'm still in touch with her today and

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,200
it's I think it's women like that that

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,750
make a huge difference we need more

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,820
visible role models because right now

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:03,730
what women are seeing in the tech

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:07,669
industry scandal wage gaps hiring bias

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:10,160
bro culture and the few highly visible

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:14,150
successful women are just not cutting

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,610
through that noise here's a good example

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:20,770
of what happens when you do try to

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:25,669
ignore the whole pipeline crap in 2015

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:28,310
thank you Intel set a goal that 40% of

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:32,410
all new hires would be women or

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,100
underrepresented minorities they got

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,760
43.1%

00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:41,280
an Intel chief executive

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,260
Crow's NH said if the pipeline was such

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,960
a big problem I would have come back as

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,990
a failure there so if one huge tech

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,500
company can do this in one year with one

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,260
goal

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:57,930
anyone can don't believe that the

00:06:52,260 --> 00:07:00,890
pipeline is a problem so getting women

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:05,010
into tech one problem keeping them is

00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:06,720
another the leaky bucket is the name

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,000
given to women trickling out of the

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,580
industry the tech world needs to attack

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,450
this issue on both fronts attraction and

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,550
retention getting women into tech is

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,910
pointless if there's no effort to retain

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:25,490
them but we can't make assumptions as to

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,860
why women leave so why are women leaving

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,500
one of the main reasons is pay women are

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,980
actually more likely than men to leave

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:39,450
because of pay and the other reason is

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,590
bias why don't women leave they're

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,340
actually not leaving because of

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,230
motherhood companies assume the women of

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,180
childbearing age are leaving because

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,700
they're having children but that's

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:55,830
really just not the case most women who

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,960
leave their job stay in the workforce so

00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,400
when it comes to retention

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,010
don't focus your retention strategies on

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,570
motherhood the difference between men

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,240
and women's reasons for leaving are

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,790
really highly overstated so don't assume

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,920
talk to women in your company if you're

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:17,970
losing women and develop data-driven

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:21,300
retention strategies I read a really

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,620
fascinating study called the it was

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,360
called gender bias against women of

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,400
color and science and they talked about

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,690
the five biases pushing women out of

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,270
stem it was the center for work-life law

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,590
they did they studied decades of gender

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,640
research as well as doing some of their

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:41,250
own studies and they identified five key

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,540
biases encountered by women in STEM

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:49,740
fields so the first one they called

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,570
prove it again so women often have to

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,750
provide

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,770
more evidence of competence than men in

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,940
order to be seen as equally competent

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,640
the Harvard Business Review did a

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,610
follow-up study on this and two-thirds

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,120
of women reported having to prove

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,370
themselves over and over again they had

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,710
their successes discounted and their

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:19,190
expertise questioned the next bias they

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,200
called the tightrope women often find

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,750
themselves walking a tightrope between

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,700
being seen as too feminine to be

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,550
competent or too masculine to be likable

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,840
women are also more likely to take on

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,170
administrative tasks or things like

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,870
kitchen duty and to be looked down on if

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,580
they don't I know this one is one I can

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,710
really identify with throughout my

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,630
career I know a lot of other women in

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,130
the tech industry too you know

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,720
especially when you're younger you think

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,780
should I act like one of the boys to fit

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,730
in do I prove I'm have to be a girl now

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,790
am I being too girly am i trying too

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,470
hard to fit in I also identify with the

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,050
other part of it and feeling like I want

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,570
to do administrative tasks or clean up

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,660
after things although I don't think I've

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,150
ever been treated poorly for not doing

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:13,010
them but I know this is a really really

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:17,150
tough one especially in our industry the

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:19,160
third one the maternal wall so when

00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,890
women have children professional

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,640
opportunities dry up there are strong

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,110
assumptions that when women that women

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,730
lose their work commitment and

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:33,770
competence after they have children but

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,870
women who remain indisputably committed

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,820
to their work are then penalized because

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,850
people assume they're not good mothers

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,290
so it's a catch-22 people assume you

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,030
lose your commitment to your work when

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,000
you have children but they look down on

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,080
you a few they assume you are

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,670
prioritizing your work over your

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,850
children you literally can't win a quote

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,890
in this study from an asian-american

00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,230
immunologist said I have to fight very

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,540
hard to show that I am a good scientist

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,959
as well as a good mother

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,990
a black microbiologist said there is an

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,050
assumption that your career is more of a

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:20,279
hobby than a career and I think these

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:21,930
coats are just heartbreaking the next

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,230
type of bias that they identified they

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:29,000
called tug of war sometimes gender bias

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:31,860
against women fuels conflict among women

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,740
women often exhibit the same bias

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,459
against women in traditionally masculine

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,199
careers that men do and when women have

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,569
experienced discrimination early in

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:48,870
their careers they may distance

00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:51,870
themselves from other women and I have

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,850
to say that this one this one really

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,699
bums me out you know women have to deal

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,040
with and we just have enough to deal

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,649
with and we should be in a position to

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,170
support one another you know if you're a

00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,420
women developer or anyone of course

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,389
who's met another woman and you've

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:13,139
questioned her technical skills based on

00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:15,870
her gender or been surprised that she

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,000
was developer or an engineer I want you

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,139
to sit with that and really think about

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,610
what made you think that or assume that

00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,699
and think about how you can change your

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,260
thinking in the future because that's

00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:31,110
really important you know you want

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,889
others to think of you the same way that

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,269
you think about them right you know I

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,130
don't want to judge women for thinking

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,510
about this because like they said a lot

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,880
of this is based on how we've been

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,199
treated but we just have so much to deal

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,959
with that we should try to make sure

00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:50,670
that we're lifting each other up as much

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,889
as we possibly can and the last kind of

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:57,269
bias is not a surprise it's sexual

00:12:52,889 --> 00:13:01,860
harassment in a study of 60 science

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:06,329
tests all women of color 34.5% reported

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:11,009
sexual harassment in a 2014 study of

00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:14,040
scientists that 64 percent of 666

00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:16,389
respondents had experienced some sort of

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,829
sexual harassment while doing field

00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:23,470
sexual harassment is also a major

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:23,470
problem in science fields at university

00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:29,690
Kelly Ellis Susan Fowler Julianne

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:34,459
Horvath

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:36,560
Katrina Lake and Whitney Wolfe what do

00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:38,750
all these women have in common they are

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,000
just a few of the women who have spoken

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:45,160
up about sexual harassment at tech

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,259
companies like Google Buber and github

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,259
sexual harassment is a huge an ongoing

00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:54,670
issue in the tech industry and we are

00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,670
just starting to pull back the curtain

00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:02,569
this quote from Katie Levinson and lean

00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:05,600
out really nails the culture of hushing

00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:08,300
up and keeping quiet we don't call

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,870
anybody who talks about sexism and tech

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,360
a whistleblower but there is a

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:18,920
revolution happening and women aren't

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,220
keeping quiet anymore so what needs to

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:26,149
change break the silence keep talking

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:30,139
about it call it out we also need clear

00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:33,889
codes of conduct we need clear reporting

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:36,889
and follow up with no retaliation most

00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:39,230
women don't report harassment some don't

00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,480
want to take the risk alone some fear

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,040
retaliation some don't know who to

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,009
report it to or they don't think

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,630
anything will be done some don't want to

00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:50,540
end someone's career they just want to

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,339
stop the behavior we also need a very

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,189
serious personal commitment at all

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:57,439
levels to stopping this everyone at

00:14:55,189 --> 00:15:01,250
every level in every organization needs

00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:02,750
to be committed to this also in the

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,910
university level when it comes to a

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,230
legal discrimination against parents and

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,319
pregnant women which has also been

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,160
reported in the science field

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:13,040
universities need to take this really

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,589
seriously if federal funding is involved

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,069
title 9 also covers women against this

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:20,899
discrimination and harassment

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:22,579
so some tools for change a really

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,730
interesting site called know your title

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:27,500
9 it empowers students to stop sexual

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,190
violence it has a lot of really good

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,720
information

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,209
another really interesting thing is

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
called bystander training sexual

00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:37,500
harassment training as we know it is

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,709
mostly useless at worst it enforces

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,069
gender stereotypes bystander training on

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:47,220
the other hand empowers people to do

00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:49,620
things like call out offensive jokes ask

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,500
a co-worker if they're okay after being

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,620
the butt of a crude joke or offering to

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,600
accompany them to HR it helps to create

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,740
a dialogue and tell people that it's

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,800
okay to speak up we also need to promote

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,949
more women research has continually

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,680
shown that companies with more women and

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:13,620
management have less sexual harassment

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,720
it's partly because harassment

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,269
flourishes when men are in power and

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,430
women aren't and men feel pressure to

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:26,850
accept other men's sexualized behavior

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:28,800
so speaking of promoting women let's

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,850
talk a little bit about hiring and also

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,740
imposter syndrome women are often less

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,939
confident than men and their technical

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:42,240
skills men apply for a job when they

00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:44,310
meet only 60% of the qualifications but

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:52,680
women will generally only apply when

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:54,620
they meet 100% of them we do not all

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,939
have the confidence of Olivia Pope

00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:03,269
unfortunately but is it just a

00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:06,419
perception and confidence issue imposter

00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:08,370
syndrome is very real but women often do

00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,079
need to meet more of the qualifications

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,890
to be hired than to their male

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,419
counterparts

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:18,390
a 2011 McKinsey report found that men

00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:22,380
are often hired or promoted based on

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:24,510
their potential and women are hired or

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:31,590
promoted based on their experience and

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:34,559
track record so what do I do here do we

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,960
just have to get better do we just have

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,720
to be so much more amazing and

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,750
everything that we do do we make sure we

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,040
have a gender-blind application and

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:50,300
during process do we hire for skill do

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,670
we hire for merit and ability let's talk

00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:57,410
about that one and talk about

00:17:52,670 --> 00:18:01,990
meritocracy here are some words that

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,990
come up when we think about meritocracy

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:17,180
these are all quotes a lot of them from

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:20,540
companies like uber and Google super

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:24,140
pumped meritocracy and toe stepping I

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:29,660
did not make that up we always see words

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:31,640
like rock star guru ninja unicorn people

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,460
refer to those whom themselves as a self

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,330
great made great man they say let's get

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:41,030
people like us we don't make mistakes

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:44,720
always be hustling he's a top performer

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:48,830
he's the chosen one well what's the

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,110
problem with getting people like us this

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,910
is a quote from the book lean out by

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:56,060
someone who's sort of an avatar called

00:18:52,910 --> 00:19:00,230
fate Grimlock and they say if you let

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:03,470
someone build tomorrow tomorrow will

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:09,580
belong to someone else they will build a

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,580
better tomorrow for everyone like them

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,690
so meritocracy at its basis is selecting

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,650
people on the basis of their ability and

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,570
it's crap it doesn't work the term

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:28,270
became popular after it was used in a

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:31,700
1958 satirical essay by Michael Young

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:34,700
which pictured the UK ruled by a class

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,850
they put aptitude and intelligence above

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,390
all else it results in hiring people

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:44,540
like you because you view their ability

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:48,590
through your lens and ability is a

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:51,770
function of Education and privilege so

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,500
say you're an MIT educated upper middle

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,160
class white man who majored in computer

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,470
science

00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,480
you're probably going to think very

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:04,580
highly of the ability of another MIT

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,030
educated upper middle class white man

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:10,570
who majored in computer science

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:13,910
especially compared to say a

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:16,160
working-class woman of color who went to

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,790
night school and got her associate's and

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,220
then self-taught with online classes if

00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,490
they can code the same what's the

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,930
difference they have the same ability

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:32,540
right but you MIT educated upper middle

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,970
class white man are thinking well the

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,970
quality of his education is higher but

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:43,430
now you're judging his privilege and his

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:46,010
background and not his ability so you

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,870
think what's the worst thing if we only

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,340
hire a brilliant programmers as long as

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,070
they come from all walks of life

00:20:49,340 --> 00:21:00,280
you get genius coders and

00:20:52,070 --> 00:21:02,810
there's no room for them anymore and

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,760
people should never be hired or judged

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:08,960
on one characteristic it doesn't matter

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,970
what it is and a lot of startups say

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,440
okay but I need to hire people now so

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,760
I'm just gonna hire people I trust I'll

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,960
hire all the people from my school and

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,200
then I'll hire a whole bunch of black

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,150
people and ladies yeah okay but if you

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,370
start hiring people who look and think

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,500
like you it only gets harder and harder

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,240
and harder to become diverse down the

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,620
road because who's gonna want to come

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,340
work for your stupid company full of

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,020
white dudes

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:36,380
nobody white dudes because guess what

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:39,440
being a woman of color in tech is even

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,830
harder in a study of women in STEM

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,130
fields black women were seventy six

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,980
point nine percent more likely to report

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,050
having to provide more evidence of

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,140
competence than others to prove

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,500
themselves to colleagues again Olivia

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,500
Pope

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:06,470
48% of black women and 46.9% of Latinas

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:09,660
report having been mistaken for Miss

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,120
administrative or custodial staff this

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,470
is from that same study of women in stem

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,060
these are scientists being mistaken for

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:21,590
janitors because of the color of their

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:24,900
skin this is messed up

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,790
black women also reported being openly

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,870
confronted by negative racial

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:34,020
stereotypes the postdoctoral advisor of

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:37,470
a biologist quote turns to me and says

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:41,400
hey do you have any family on drugs or

00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:49,230
in jail this is a woman who is working

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:50,480
on her PhD okay let's move on to

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,030
something else

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,320
work-life balance slack has it right

00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,110
they have signs in their office that

00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,670
says work hard and go home that should

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,750
be the norm why is that not the norm

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,080
that's what we should do at work we

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,300
should work hard and go home women are

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,730
especially penalized for having to leave

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,560
at normal hours because women are more

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,420
likely to be primary caretakers of

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,640
children or relatives and they're

00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,250
penalized for being seen as less

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,190
committed to their jobs but a healthy

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:23,280
work environment recognizes and

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,720
encourages a life outside of work did a

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,710
whole talk on work-life balance last

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:32,760
year along with work-life balance we

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,800
also need good benefits big tech

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,470
companies now offer many benefits that

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,980
are aimed particularly at women and

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:44,370
mothers childcare parental leave egg

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,430
freezing IVF surrogacy paid parental

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,380
leave for partners concierge and

00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,650
convenient services for new parents

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:55,110
fancy shipping breast milk comb when

00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:57,870
traveling for work this is a huge step

00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,290
up but equal pay at 40-hour weeks would

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,290
be even better

00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:06,130
especially because many of these

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,100
benefits kind of seem aimed at delaying

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,050
motherhood for the sake of career or

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,100
getting moms back in the office a little

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:16,420
faster so let's talk about that pay by

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,950
the way I found out today that it's

00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,110
equal pay day and I didn't know that

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,010
until I had already left the house so

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,930
this is very very OnPoint hired calm did

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,500
a study called the state of wage

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:33,010
inequality in the workplace so here's

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,560
one on average women are offered four

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:40,450
percent less money than men for the same

00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:42,880
role in the same company so here's a

00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,650
graph showing that there's a high

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,090
variation in the salaries offered to

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,250
candidates for the same job the same

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,770
company and the number of times women

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,140
are offered less than men is almost two

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:57,610
times greater than the number of times

00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:01,030
that men are offered less than women not

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:03,370
cool they also found that 63% of the

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,050
time men are offered higher salaries for

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,480
women than women for the same role at

00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,370
the same company on average these women

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,710
these companies offer women four percent

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,410
less than men for the same role with

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:23,650
some offering women up to forty five

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:27,190
percent less for the same role age also

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:30,730
plays a role ages women ages 41 to 45

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:34,510
get paid 90 cents on the dollar compared

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:37,600
to men women ages 20 to 25 are doing the

00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,780
best at 97 percent 97 cents on the

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,780
dollar

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,450
naturally experience plays a role in

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:48,730
salary you'd think at 13 to 14 years

00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,520
experience the wage gap really wouldn't

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:55,090
be a thing anymore right but women with

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:59,410
13 to 14 years experience or 92 cents on

00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:03,790
the dollar compared to men I have so

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:06,820
much to look forward to and when broken

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:10,750
down by race and gender black and

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,370
hispanic women made the least at ninety

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,880
cents on the dollar compared to white

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:20,350
men

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:22,720
I also did a state of salaries report

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,970
and these were the average preferred

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,220
salaries and then offered salaries by

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,170
race and this shows a significant

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,230
difference and the salaries asked for

00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:35,440
and received by candidates according to

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:39,040
race with black candidates receiving the

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,170
lowest lower still were candidates who

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,780
identified at multiracial with an

00:26:41,170 --> 00:27:01,150
average preferred salary of just 123 K

00:26:43,780 --> 00:27:06,120
and an average offer of 128 K so what

00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:12,780
can we do about all this how about that

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:18,970
equal pay for equal work we can also

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:22,510
hire women find them recruit them do the

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:25,540
work stop sitting around blaming other

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:28,750
things don't blame the pipeline the

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:31,420
leaky bucket don't passively wonder why

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:34,510
there aren't women in your company talk

00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:38,050
to women ask women to look at your job

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:41,050
descriptions avoid loaded and masculine

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,660
terms don't ask for ninjas and gurus and

00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:46,110
rock stars don't have beer in your

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:49,750
office stop with the ping pong and the

00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,700
happy hour women don't want to play ping

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,770
pong and drink beer in the office ok

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:59,740
it's not that we don't like ping pong

00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:01,690
and beer it just makes it just makes us

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:06,160
think that it's a bro culture and that's

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:08,380
not what we want I actually recently

00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,750
wrote a blog post where I asked all the

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,540
women in our company like what made you

00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,790
want to work at chromatic like what drew

00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,260
you in and and what are things that have

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,900
made you not want to work at other

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,510
companies and one of the things that a

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:25,300
lot of the women said was one that we

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:27,610
didn't say we wanted ninjas and guru

00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,230
and rock stars and that we didn't apply

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,800
to other companies because they did want

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,390
ninjas and rock stars that language

00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,120
matters and it gives you an impression

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:40,060
of the company and its culture and and

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,790
what's going on there and you also

00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,890
really need to assess and evaluate your

00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,340
culture and find out if it's friendly to

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,160
women

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,590
and if you don't know you have to ask

00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,780
women if there aren't women in your

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,660
company you have to see some out and

00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,280
find them and talk to them talk to women

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,510
and other companies find some

00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:05,320
consultants talk to them we're we're not

00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:08,380
scary we're here and and we will answer

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,450
your questions you know you have to you

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,880
have to do your research you have to

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,400
approach this as any other business need

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,460
making your company diverse isn't just

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,800
some some pipe dream it's it's vital

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,620
it's it's how your company is going to

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,760
grow and and have different voices and

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:30,100
have different perspectives and and be

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:34,660
intelligent and it's just it's so

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,970
important I just I just can't stress

00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,590
that enough I feel like there are so

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:41,170
many companies out there that just sit

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,450
around going like dude oh where are the

00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,970
women and and they don't do anything

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,400
about it so I just I want companies to

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:52,330
just reach out and and talk to people

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,610
and talk to women you know and put it up

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:58,660
there with all of the other important

00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:01,060
business needs that they have so I

00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,280
that's that's my last slide I finished a

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,050
little bit a little bit early so if

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,940
there's any questions or QA I would be

00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,940
happy to to answer

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,590
hi Dave

at the time all white men what advice

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,010
would you give to a woman looking to

00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:35,870
enter into a team that might be in the

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:39,440
same position I did give it a lot of

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:44,000
thought I researched the company pretty

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,790

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:37,429
conversations and that made me

00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,230
comfortable and then when when I came on

00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:41,300
full-time we spent the entire dinner

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,830
talking about me being the first woman

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,880
and you sort of being an ambassador for

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,679
the company and that made me really

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,270
comfortable and that and that you guys

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,309
were passionate about diversity and that

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,070
you were excited to bring a woman on and

00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:54,290
that made me really happy so those were

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,210
all really good signs and I knew that

00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,770
you guys had been it showed me that you

00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,690
were trying and that you were happy to

00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,120
like be increasing the diversity and

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,380
this wasn't just ahead like like oh yeah

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,809
yeah we're just a bunch of white dudes

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,280
and like we just were little now you're

00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:09,220
just a woman bla bla bla like that you

00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,809
were happy and this was purposeful and

00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,910
that just all made things feel really

00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,050
good to me so I would you know I would

00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,120
encourage other women to do that like

00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,440
have the conversation like see that

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,169
these are individual people that you

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,740
want to work with because somebody has

00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:24,809
to be the first woman and

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,340
it's a woman led company in which case

00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:30,210
you have to be the first guy so do the

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:35,070
same thing I guess does that answer your

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:45,440
okay but now we have five women which is

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:45,440
pretty cool anything else anybody

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,210
you know I totally agree I think there's

00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,460
also another layer to that of like

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:52,910
companies that tend to have a beer and

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:55,940
ping pong like they their level of

00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:58,640
serious might be like a different you

00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,680
know the way that they see themselves in

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,050
the way that their their culture is is

00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,480
something that is often just not as

00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:08,210
friendly to women like they just it's

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,460
not even just about fun but they they

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:12,020
tend to also be the cultures that you

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,030
know they don't take sexual harassment

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,380
as seriously or you know people are you

00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,610
know and when people are drinking in the

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,130
office especially during the work day

00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:22,430
like that's not gonna be a safe of a

00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,750
place to be for anybody you know and

00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,490
things like that so I think a lot of

00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,160
women see that as a turn-off not just

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,570
because of the fun aspect but like you

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,030
know are you taking the things you need

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,830
to be taking seriously seriously or are

00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,450
you all just like yeah let's just have

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:40,490
fun and like bust out some code like

00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,900
this is just you know so I think you

00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,910
know those especially that sort of start

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,650
up five where it's like no we're not a

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:48,170
business we're just like some dudes

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,540
having fun like and I think that that's

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:56,200
that can be a real sketchy area for

00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:56,200
women yeah

00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:04,290
oh yeah sorry the answer might be

00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,940
obvious I mean Google indeed all these

00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:08,570
things LinkedIn but where would you say

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:12,000
is the best place to find women to hire

00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:13,590
I think that's a really good question

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,869
there are a lot of there are a lot more

00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:20,010
job sites that are for women

00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:26,460
specifically these days I haven't been

00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:30,210
looking for a talk recently so I'm not

00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,010
sure I know that a good one that I

00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:35,130
recommend to people who are looking for

00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:37,859
remote jobs is called power to fly

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,859
because they specifically try and place

00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:43,530
women like flexible remote jobs but I

00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:47,190
think that that is a growing like a

00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:52,109
growing industry of like job sites for

00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:59,630
for women but if not there need to be

00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:59,630
certainly more of them sure I just I

00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,970
will say first that I'm upset that so

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,240
many of your anecdotes deeply relate to

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:12,839
my experiences in the tech workplace but

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,790
I just want to ask so I work in a non

00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:17,040
tech environment and I'm the only

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:19,230
technical person there I'm also up

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,330
against a strong age difference and my

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:24,000
supervisor line up about 20 years

00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,710
difference the youngest person there and

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,420
so I just I want to ask about your

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,670
questions for advocating for your

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,440
technical needs resources professional

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,960
development when you have non-technical

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,990
people above you I think that can be a

00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,089
really tough one and depends a lot on

00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,570
your relationship with like your

00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:44,460
managers and your higher-ups I had dealt

00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,770
with that one once and what had worked

00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,390
for me was I had a really non-technical

00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,359
direct manager but I had a better

00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,160
relationship with his manager so I would

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,599
sometimes just wind up having to go a

00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,940
little bit over his head even though

00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,950
that was uncomfortable but he understood

00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,589
my needs a lot better because he just

00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,030
came from a more similar background so

00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:05,040
sometimes just finding someone else in

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,710
your organization who can relate to you

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,320
a little bit better can be the best

00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,460
thing

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,470
even if it's not the person that you're

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,300
supposed to and that can really depend

00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:17,200
on your organization but just finding

00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:20,690
the right person but I think also just

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,800
finding data to back up your needs and

00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:27,530
saying like you know and also not asking

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,220
saying like I need this because data and

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,900
I need to do this because data and you

00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,420
know instead of just saying could I may

00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,480
I and just putting out there especially

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,550
because you're younger and you know

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,800
asking permission might make you feel

00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:45,170
like you're a kid just saying like can I

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,790
please do this and instead just stating

00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,920
your needs and saying I need to do this

00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:51,280
I think can help you feel a little more

00:38:48,920 --> 00:39:07,790
you know just putting it out there and

00:38:51,280 --> 00:39:10,610
saying that it's what you need I have a

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:15,700
suggestion in your review process can

00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:17,510
you ask specifically to have a line of

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,640
somebody who's doing the same job as you

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,970
in another area give feedback because we

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,500
even at Penn State go god you know they

00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,540
don't do anything anything but they do

00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:30,950
it in the review process they do allow

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,300
feedback from a colleague on the same

00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,640
level

00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:39,320
maybe that for the review process of it

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,240
at all yes exactly like like my top

00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,110
title as multimedia specialist too so I

00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,700
could say somebody from another

00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,130
department like my friend Nicky back

00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:49,070
here if I did since we're doing the same

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,440
type of work she could review me on the

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:54,520
work that I'm doing the technical work

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,520
so then my boss can see that

00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:07,540
this microphone is for tall people so

00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,910
yeah I've been in tech since about 2000

00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:13,030
and the majority of my career has been

00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:16,120
with companies run by men working mostly

00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,650
with men which is not unusual I

00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,240
currently work for a company called

00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,700
communicate health and it's actually a

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,290
women-owned women run company we're not

00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,360
just a web development company though we

00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,720
do communications for the public health

00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,520
sectors so we have researchers writers

00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,530
developers designers so we have a kind

00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,170
of small development team within our

00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:39,400
larger team but even on our development

00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:41,230
team in a company run by women we have

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,190
seven developers and only two of us are

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,670
women which is interesting so I know

00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,380
we're working are we're actually

00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:53,140
dedicated to trying to get a more

00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,000
diverse group of people in our in our

00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,220
employees now and that's something that

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,680
the company is actually like striving

00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,990
for so what advice would you give a

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,870
company trying to find more women

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,370
technical women like where do you find

00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,610
them how do you go about finding them

00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,490
like actual real world ways of

00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:14,350
recruiting them and seeking them out I

00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:17,920
think one way would be to get involved

00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:19,360
and look at like you know if you're you

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,260
know if you're not distributed look at

00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:26,410
like local groups like you know who's

00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,280
doing who's teaching you know say if

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,560
you're looking for a JavaScript

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,350
developer who's teaching the local girl

00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:36,250
development JavaScript class you know

00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:38,200
who's teaching the local you know like

00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,000
ladies learning code class or things

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,440
like that like reach out and you know

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,540
see who's doing that like who are the

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,360
local subject matter experts and the

00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:48,250
thing that you want to do like look on

00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:51,370
Meetup look on Twitter and like actually

00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:55,060
seek them out and like recruit those

00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:57,190
women directly and find them like that's

00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,380
that's what I would do like that's what

00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,640
I you know I was the I'm the track chair

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,030
for the back-end development team and

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:07,570
like I actually went out and like

00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:10,000
searched for women in you know the space

00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:11,680
that I wanted to and send them messages

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,440
and was like hey I would love for you to

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,509
submit

00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,220
and that was a much broader thing but I

00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:19,160
think especially if you're in a location

00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:21,109
yeah it's even easier like find find

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,630
organizations and find the women in them

00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:25,940
and and or just go to meetups and talk

00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:28,269
to women and put your name out there and

00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,269
things like that

00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:35,660
hello I mean for me I often think about

00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,059
like impact intent of our privileged

00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,440
positions like I'm a company you know

00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,240
whether it will have a beard I'm a dude

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,400
and I always tend to think about just

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,710
you know what position can I be in to

00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,690
really help people and your constant

00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,309
toggled language before metaphors too

00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,779
that we use are very powerful it could

00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:52,940
be a sports metaphor to contribute

00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:55,279
contribute to like bro culture the

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,990
pronouns we use a lot of latent things

00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:58,430
that we do they're implicit that caste

00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,750
valuing meeting and we really need to

00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,279
kind of look at that so something some

00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:03,170
tight end to think about plus a question

00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:04,730
I'm curious what you think yeah I

00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,289
totally agree and also like coming from

00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,420
a place of privilege like you have the

00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:11,539
best vantage point to call that stuff

00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,329
out because the other people in the room

00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:16,190
are gonna be less comfortable like you

00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:18,529
know if someone's saying like hey Bros

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,819
or hey dudes or whatever you are the

00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,410
strongest person in the room to call

00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:23,569
that out and say hey maybe you don't say

00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,609
that or if someone says an inappropriate

00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:27,019
joke or anything like that like you have

00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:28,130
the privilege the most comfortable

00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:30,829
privilege to call that out because

00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,299
you're not going to get flack or if you

00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:33,829
do it's not going to affect you in the

00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:36,440
same way that it's gonna affect someone

00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:37,549
else so the people with the privilege of

00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:46,910
the people who have to do the calling

00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:50,599
out yeah come up this might have been

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,380
answered earlier so I apologize but I

00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:53,210
don't think there's much difference

00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,589
between the needs of a man and the woman

00:43:53,210 --> 00:44:00,529
but I'm just curious if there are any

00:43:57,589 --> 00:44:03,980
specific needs for females is it more

00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:05,480
because of historical values historical

00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,920
reasons that causes these values or is

00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,559
it more intrinsic for example like

00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,789
safety in a workplace historically has

00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:13,279
been a little bit more difficult for

00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:14,750
female than for men I don't think that

00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:18,349
the needs are different I think that

00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:21,259
we've made the reality different so we

00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:23,809
need to change that reality so that

00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:25,759
we're facing the same thing like you

00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:26,390
know our safety we both have the same

00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:28,430
knee

00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:32,510
for safety but our reality is different

00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:35,480
because we're treated differently you

00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:38,690
know like because you know in general

00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,519
like women are preyed on by men in a way

00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,970
that men aren't preyed on by women so

00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:48,829
men don't have the safety needs that we

00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:51,710
that women have so it's not it's not

00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:53,930
that our needs are different you know

00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:56,150
and like or in terms of pay like we

00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,920
don't have different needs for pay but

00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,069
we aren't valued in the same way that

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,650
men are so we need to change our reality

00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:04,849
to match the reality of men does that

00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,269
make sense does that answer your

00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:10,849
question okay I think there was someone

00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:14,260
else over here who was about to stand up

00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:14,260
and then didn't oh come on

00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:20,510
maybe this is like a bigger and harder

00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,430
question but I couldn't help but notice

00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:25,279
that there's more women in this room

00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:27,260
than men and this talk seemed like it

00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:29,000
would be a really important one for all

00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:33,230
the men in our community so how do we

00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:40,309
get more men in a room like this do you

00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:41,900
have any ideas for that I I think that's

00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:45,380
a tough one and I'm happy to see that

00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:48,259
there are men here I I don't know

00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,170
honestly and I was happy that this was

00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,950
in the business track I had some

00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,450
discussions with the track chairs and we

00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:56,990
decided to put it there and one of the

00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:58,609
reasons was to get more men in it um I

00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,069
had originally we thought about putting

00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:01,970
it and maybe being human and we felt no

00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:03,589
let's you know this is a

00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,730
business-related discussion this is

00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:06,170
about the workplace

00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,400
and maybe we'll get some more guys in

00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,740
here and I'm happy to see that there are

00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,470
guys in here but no you're right and um

00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:15,430
I'm not I'm not sure how to get more men

00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:19,269
in here other than to just keep trying

00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:19,269
go for it come up to the mic

00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:29,160
I was just gonna speak to that because

00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:31,050
we have a few diversity initiative

00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,790
groups at four kitchens right now

00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,110
and there's like four different groups

00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,740
who are kind of tackling different

00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:40,470
issues like marketing like how do we fix

00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,780
our marketing to like be more inclusive

00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,750
how do we fix our interviewing to be

00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,490
more inclusive you know etc and when we

00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,230
opened up the group's to volunteers

00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:52,410
it was immediately like all of the women

00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:54,060
who volunteered and so I just called

00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:57,690
people out and I was like we need more

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,490
men like there's also diversity issues

00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:02,040
on that end if we don't have like you

00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,870
guys supporting us and being a part of

00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,150
the conversation so call people out and

00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:08,250
just like if you have your team say

00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,690
there's this session I'm going to you

00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,300
should come with me because I know that

00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:16,310
you know it's important to me for me to

00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,310
have that support so that's my advice

00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,940
hey I'm being represented by the guys on

00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:25,890
my team here so ladies bring your male

00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,460
team members to the diversity sessions

00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:37,860
just saying is there anyone else we've

00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:40,890
still got a few more minutes come up but

00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:43,740
I just wanted to say that I think part

00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:48,440
of the thing that separates us puts us

00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:48,440
in a different place from men is that

00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,820
things that are expected of men aren't

00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,070
necessarily expected of women were

00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,630
raised in a different way where we're

00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,460
not challenged you know things aren't

00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:04,460
expected so we're forced to do these

00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:07,170
things but also part of that is is us

00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,330
sort of supporting this male stereotype

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,550
where we're expecting men to know things

00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:13,950
we're going to them for help we're

00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:16,110
asking them to do like certain manly

00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:20,760
things and we're treating them as if we

00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:22,560
expect them to have their manly role so

00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,060
I think part of it is not just thinking

00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,600
about how men can treat us but how we

00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:30,270
can treat men and and not sort of like

00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,010
supporting the stereotype that they have

00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:36,840
to be doing there Matt

00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:39,360
men things because it sort of reinforces

00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,310
the you know the need for them to feel

00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,300
like they have to act in that way where

00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,950
they have to act like they know

00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,800
everything and they have to act like

00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:49,470
they have to take care of you know do

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,660
things for women and you know not expect

00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,490
things of women so I just want to

00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,840
mention that part of it is you know

00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:57,630
thinking about the way we treat men

00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:01,110
because it's also difficult for them to

00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:02,520
have these expectations that they've

00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:06,270
grown up with that we haven't

00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:09,140
necessarily grown up with and yeah just

00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:11,520
like kind of keeping that in mind also

00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,780
yeah I know I've definitely thought

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,400
about that one before and there's been

00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,870
times where I've like asked a male

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,280
coworker to grab my suitcase and I'm

00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,200
like am I asking him because he's a guy

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:25,290
or is it because he lifts weights

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:28,020
competitively hmm so sometimes you can

00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:30,350
overthink that one but know that is

00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:35,520
definitely a good thing to keep in mind

00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:37,170
is there anything else just made me

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,970
think of the whole issue of toxic

00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,740
masculinity and is something that I feel

00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:43,230
like needs to be come at it in order to

00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,410
make things more equal for women and

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:49,530
that includes equal parental leave for

00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:56,700
dads too so that's seen as not a women's

00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:59,390
issue but a human issue yes yes I like I

00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:07,110
like your future geek shirts

00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:08,820
yes this is not a question but just on

00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,790
in terms of hiring and job posts there

00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:13,230
are like tools out there that you can

00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,060
use you just put your job posting and

00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,710
they'll read through you'd be surprised

00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,410
what other words get picked up and

00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:21,210
flagged as more masculine coded versus

00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,920
feminine coded so I always make sure to

00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,030
run my job posts through this just to

00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,850
make sure that they're more feminine

00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:28,410
coded because it's shown that like men

00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:31,110
are still going to apply to more

00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:32,700
feminine coded job posts than women are

00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:35,130
so women are gonna mostly apply to

00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,290
feminine coded job posts so just things

00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:40,500
that come up are like things that sound

00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:42,330
super competitive will generally deter

00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,190
women so I can never remember the URL

00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,020
for it but I would just Google

00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,000
gender decoder job posts and I usually

00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,710
find it just put your job post in and

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,610
that's a good place to start if you

00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,320
don't have any women in your

00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:57,090
organization to review your job post

00:50:52,320 --> 00:51:04,800
that's an easy place to start so what is

00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:08,310
it te XT IO calm okay yeah I think it

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,260
even Flags things like outgoing because

00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,570
you know some women don't want to be

00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:20,720
like hey team how's it going every

00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:28,350
morning's really who does anybody else

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:30,480
got a couple minutes run up I miss him

00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,760
your presentation too so if you covered

00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,270
this already I apologize you talked

00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,740
earlier about like a boozy culture being

00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:40,680
something that might want to be avoided

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:44,160
from a discomfort level too if you're

00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:46,530
looking at making it a more inclusive

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,080
culture kind of from the top or at least

00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:51,360
from all of the different groups levels

00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,430
I don't think it's arguable that there

00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,810
tends to be different cultures depending

00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,430
on the disciplines and the technology

00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:58,200
company right sales marketing

00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:00,690
development that kind of thing too so

00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,980
besides not having a boozy culture what

00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,330
what else do you think might be a

00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,740
consistent thing that we could either

00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:10,170
proactively do or proactively avoid that

00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,360
would still be applicable whether a

00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:14,760
female was in sales or marketing or

00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,800
development or anything like that where

00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,780
it's maybe that would be a great fit for

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,640
a development manager to be concerned

00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,620
with but not necessarily something that

00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,240
would I mean you want a salesperson to

00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:25,890
be outgoing right so you wouldn't

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,540
necessarily want to avoid that in a job

00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,800
description for a salesperson so what

00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,960
are the other things that maybe we can

00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,010
do from a consistency standpoint that

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,270
would apply to all these different

00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,400
groups and cultures within a larger

00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:37,950
organization do you mean in terms of job

00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,920
listings or in terms of like other like

00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:42,660
extracurricular type yeah or like

00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,940
extracurricular type or just how

00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,560
communications and are done throughout

00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,000
the day stuff like that I didn't

00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,680
necessarily mean job description but

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,120
when we talk about even job descriptions

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,980
right I mean there are some very

00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,140
specific roles within companies and

00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,460
again you don't want a salesperson to

00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:00,040
not be outgoing for instance right so in

00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,780
something might make any developer

00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,849
frustrated whereas it would be nothing

00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,920
to any salesperson so but there's got to

00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:08,320
be consistencies across those groups in

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,640
general I think well I mean obviously I

00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,050
think it's it's fine to use a term like

00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,609
outgoing for a salesperson I was

00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:14,320
thinking more like you know tech that

00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:18,160
can be a really off-putting term to a

00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:20,440
lot of people one thing that I find that

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:26,950
I see in more and more tech cultures is

00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:29,230
like a lot of like hey we go hiking and

00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:32,650
we do yoga and we have all this like

00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:34,720
in-house like working out and that can

00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:36,670
be like you know that can start to

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,220
border on like the ablest kind of thing

00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:41,530
and you know not everyone can or wants

00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,930
to work out and again that can also be

00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:46,450
kind of veering into like broke culture

00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:50,250
of like hey we all want to like get

00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:54,369
pumped in the morning and you know not

00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:56,650
into that so you know obviously offering

00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:58,720
workout classes is one thing but when

00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,609
you start to make them feel compulsory

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,010
or feel like something that everybody in

00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:05,290
the company has to do like that needs to

00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:07,030
stop and I'm seeing a lot more of that

00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:09,010
not just in the tech culture but like

00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:11,500
all over the place I don't know if

00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:13,450
anyone reads ask a manager it's a really

00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,950
fantastic site but there was just a

00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,880
question the other day about I think or

00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,820
maybe I was reading an old one about

00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:21,940
like mandatory yoga and I was like why

00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:23,470
would you do that like that's the worst

00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,700
thing I've ever heard of because the

00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:28,119
person was saying the blaylak couldn't

00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:29,800
do it so things like that like actually

00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:32,200
I mean anything that that's mandatory

00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,640
that any mandatory fun should never be a

00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,730
thing like no one should have a

00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,630
mandatory fun but I mean thinking about

00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,910
anything that can make people

00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,470
uncomfortable like you know the only

00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,180
thing that should be mandatory is you

00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:45,520
know doing your work and communicating

00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,750
with your co-workers and your clients

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,320
there really shouldn't be anything else

00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,940
that's ever mandatory and you know

00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,099
things like you know you should never

00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:56,380
have a drinking culture it's you know

00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:57,880
the obviously you know like we got to

00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,859
DrupalCon we have a few drinks but some

00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,970
people don't drink or like I only have a

00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:02,800
couple drinks because I get migraines

00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,450
and no one ever pressures anybody and

00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,119
it's fine and you have to make sure that

00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:09,700
that's that's a totally okay level like

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,550
it's okay to to not do things and it's

00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,190
okay to

00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:15,890
just be yourself and that needs to be

00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:18,080
like the level that it is and and things

00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,790
like that so I hope that that answer

00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,530
your question I don't run a company so I

00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:26,030
can't answer like how all departments

00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:27,560
should be right I would say it's

00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,820
important to men and women but I know

00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,130
what's really important to me is

00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:33,380
work-life balance so anything that like

00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,880
verbally promotes that you know oh it's

00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,770
okay you know she has this great thing

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,070
to go to like just you know saying that

00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:48,860
we you know we should be able to to turn

00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:50,180
off so that's almost one so I think we

00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,810
can wrap it up thank you oh you're

00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:56,289
amazing question

00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:56,289
