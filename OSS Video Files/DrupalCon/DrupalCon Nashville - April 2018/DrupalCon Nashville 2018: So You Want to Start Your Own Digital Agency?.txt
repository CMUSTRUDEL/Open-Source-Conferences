Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: So You Want to Start Your Own Digital Agency?
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	The path to running a successful agency is riddled with obstacles, hoops to jump through, and laws to comply with - and that's all before you do the actual work. How about some real world advice from someone who transitioned from being a fledgling freelancer to a successful agency owner? It only took a decade of starts, stops, misfires and outright guesswork to get here.

This session is less of a success story and more of a guide to help would-be entrepreneurs and newly-minted agencies get started on the right foot. Rather than being a deep-dive into the HOW, this session will address the WHAT and WHY of the most critical considerations.

Attend this session and you'll come away armed to the teeth with (most) everything you need to run a successful digital agency. 

Some topics we'll cover:

Critical must-haves right out of the gate. What you need and don't need.
Strategies on transitioning from a one-man band to a team of producers.
Tools of the trade: building proposals, tracking expenses, running payroll.
Attracting the right talent.
Building culture.

and I'm ready for this to be a thing of

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,010
the past so let's get started my name is

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,849
Chris free

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,940
I run a shop called chromatic and to

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,680
begin I wish this talk well I don't

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,930
really wish this talk was more than 25

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,609
minutes but for the what I'm going to

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,840
cover 25 minutes it's not a lot of time

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:29,779
so starting a digital agency is a really

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,830
huge topic and so I've taken my sort of

00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,020
all the experience I've had in the last

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,510
ten years running chromatic and sort of

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,520
whittled it down into the advice and the

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,219
this is like the Cliff Notes version of

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,500
the talk I'd like to give someday I will

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,320
say before I get started that running a

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,780
shop is really hard but running a shop

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,129
is really awesome and this is where I

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:56,129
pause and drink some water and try not

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:58,440
to faint so if you're here presumably

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,410
you're curious about starting your own

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,670
shop or maybe you already have started

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,280
your own shop and you want to take it to

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,720
the next level so whatever your reason I

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,590
hope this talk helps you along your way

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,930
so let's talk a little bit about my

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,280
journey to get to where I'm standing

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,080
before you today back in 2008 I was two

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,170
years into my professional web

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,560
development career I was working for an

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,630
advertising agency outside Chicago and I

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,290
was sort of hand-coding microsites for

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,930
larger brands my manager Andy is in the

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,079
audience here hi Andy sorry for the

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,310
things I'm about to say now Andy Andy

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,130
was actually really great and he was a

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,649
good mentor for me everyone else at the

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,280
agency didn't really have a good sense

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,460
of what the internet could be or what

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,860
web developers could be traditionally

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,310
they were a print agency so thereby I

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,600
was underpaid I was underappreciated and

00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:02,729
on top of that I was full of righteous

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,950
ambition I was also incredibly naive by

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,039
Halloween of that same year I'd sort of

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,160
had enough of being paid only $30,000

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,300
and not really anybody really

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,790
understanding what it was that I could

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,799
bring to

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,019
agency so I decided I was going to

00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:18,700
strike out on my own and join a

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:22,540
newly-minted agency that I'd been

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,709
freelancing for called chromatic at this

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,040
time chromatic we had a really shitty

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,329
logo it wasn't this one and it was

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,459
basically two guys I went to college

00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:33,519
with who were doing professional web

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:35,260
development so I quit my job at the

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,900
advertising agency and I moved in with

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,030
my in-laws or who would later become my

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,269
in-laws and I started working full-time

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,939
for chromatic I'd saved up two months

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,769
take-home pay or roughly $1,600 and

00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:52,599
thought that oh this is plenty of

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:53,769
padding I can I can build a company well

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,359
I'm here to tell you those first few

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,569
years were really rough

00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:00,069
we were fixed bidding projects basically

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,370
taking any website or any digital

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,439
project that would come our way and

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,859
saying yes we were getting killed

00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,900
financially we were going way over

00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:13,569
budget and we were agreeing agreeing to

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,280
really poorly scope projects bottom line

00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,739
is we were not prepared to run an agency

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,090
we were not prepared to run projects

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:25,000
effectively and certainly not profitably

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,879
there were months many consecutive where

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,790
I didn't take home a single dollar so

00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:35,079
it's not all doom and gloom fast forward

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,590
to today roughly 10 years and I now own

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,879
33% of chromatic we have 15 employees

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,069
distributed across the United States and

00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,500
Europe and we work on some of the

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:48,459
biggest Drupal sites on the planet and

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,060
beyond that we have actual profit on we

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,169
have revenues in the millions of dollars

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,729
so what lessons that I learned in those

00:03:53,169 --> 00:04:00,819
10 years to start the first lessons have

00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,579
to do with money obviously money is

00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,949
fundamental to running any business

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,209
digital agencies are no different and

00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,819
you know there's much to consider with

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,620
regards to money but what I want to talk

00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:15,060
about today can be distilled down into

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,609
sort of three categories making money

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,070
taking money and borrowing money so

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:22,270
let's start with making money like I

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,650
said in the beginning we really didn't

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,969
know how we were going to make money and

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,479
we certainly didn't know how we're going

00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,479
to attract clients

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,389
this is called business development I

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,810
didn't know about business

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,000
development when I got started I

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,039
probably had never even heard that term

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,430
at that time I knew that I could code

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,070
websites I could do Drupal I didn't know

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,570
that I needed to be a marketer and then

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,669
I needed to market my skills and I

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,259
needed to effectively speak to potential

00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,570
clients to get them to give me their

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,229
dollars upfront before building a

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,490
project

00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:58,570
so my advice let's start there there are

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,289
many ways you can handle your business

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:06,100
development SEO SEM cold-calling

00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:09,220
how bout email if you're a douche public

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,530
speaking but here are a few things or

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,330
two things that have really been

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,060
beneficial to us and the first is just

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,530
doing great work we sort of fell

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,970
backwards into this we were looking we

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,680
are looking at the folks like Lola bots

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,190
who are doing really great work and just

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,500
trying to emulate what they were doing

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,300
by doing so it made us better and our

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,949
reputation sort of started to catch on

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,130
and it preceded us and it helped us

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:38,400
close deals and so doing really good

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,550
work is your best business development

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,770
and beyond that networking networking

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,889
has worked really well for us and even

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:50,229
today I would say that probably 80% of

00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,659
all of our business comes from people we

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,300
already know comes from the network

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:57,310
we've built over the last ten years you

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,750
know we get plenty of requests through

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,810
the website to do work from people we've

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,789
never met before we close almost no none

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,470
of those deals it's through people we've

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,699
met people we've collaborated with

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,970
people who've gotten to know us

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:12,099
personally so networking network network

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,780
network this is going to be really

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:18,639
important as you start start to build

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:21,070
your agency so pricing I talked a little

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,400
bit about that early on we really

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,720
struggled with making any money and in

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,099
part because we didn't know how to price

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,740
things we were fixed bidding and fixed

00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,570
bidding can be really tough I even after

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,719
10 years fixed bid is really tough we do

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,590
some fixed bid but even if you're really

00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:42,440
good at managing projects and

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:46,220
clients and managing scope fixed bid is

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,680
really tough I'm not suggesting that

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,750
time and materials is sort of a magic

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,240
bullet but when we switch to time and

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,850
materials we started to make money we

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,470
started to make real money and we

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,110
started to be able to grow our agency

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,460
because of it I think the most important

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,770
thing with regards to pricing though and

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,920
this took me way too long to realize is

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,600
that don't sell yourself short build

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,880
what you need to build to run a

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,990
profitable business and to take home a

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,300
reasonable salary and the last thing I

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,100
want to talk about with regards to

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,320
making money is sort of figuring out

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,800
your agencies why what's what's your

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,520
focus if you establish this early on it

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,720
will be really beneficial to you when we

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,390
first got started we were basically

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,510
taking anybody that had green US

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,790
currency and had a digital project so

00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,790
that meant Drupal builds that mint

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,620
expression engine builds that mint

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,270
microsites that meant really terrible

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,320
branding that I hope you never dig up on

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,260
the Internet Archive it wasn't until we

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,700
started to narrow our focus on Drupal

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,790
that we started to roll we got really

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,910
good at Drupal we got really good at

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,980
selling Drupal and because we were

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,840
focused on Drupal people trusted us with

00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,900
their drupal you know Drupal is really

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,120
complicated so I'm here to suggest that

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,060
identifying your focus can help you make

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,340
money so what does that mean that can be

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:18,010
by discipline design development SEO SEM

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,020
that can be by technology drupal

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,480
javascript headless etc or maybe it's by

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:28,370
vertical publishing healthcare there's

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,180
some mix of these like achromatic all

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,510
right so let's talk a little bit about

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,450
taking money we're making money was

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,550
really strategic taking money is sort of

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,940
tactical so if you're starting a company

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,980
I had no idea what you would need to do

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,100
to run a business how do you even start

00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,910
a business what does that mean well

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,350
you're gonna have to figure out what

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,770
your entity structure is going to be are

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,320
you going to be an LLC and that's core

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,490
etc I don't know anything

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,250
this stuff I still don't know much about

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,730
it my partners know much more about it

00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,680
than I do

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,850
but if you're like me and don't know too

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,740
much about it and how you want to

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,080
structure things I have some links at

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,460
the end of the deck nerd wallet has a

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,510
great quiz sba.gov has a ton of

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,790
different business structures and the

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,070
pros and cons I will say that the

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,430
hardest part with starting an entity for

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,290
me at least was picking the name naming

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,940
things is really hard

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,920
so in rapid-fire what else do you need

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,600
to take money from clients you're gonna

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,970
need an EIN you're gonna need a bank

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,150
account ìin at least here in the States

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,990
is just a tax identification number

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,260
you're gonna need a business banking

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,950
account probably checking and savings

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,660
what else you gonna do you're gonna need

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,910
two billing some billing software and

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,210
invoicing software we use and love

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,400
harvest you might also consider a

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,690
merchant account if you want people to

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,870
be able to be able to pay you of your

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,720
credit card this is fine we did this for

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,670
a long time but you'd be surprised how

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,290
many folks will pay you via direct

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,570
deposit or via check if you just ask

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,100
merchant account compliance is a pain

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,950
and giving credit card companies a

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,860
percentage of your profits is

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:12,970
so if you can get away with not doing it

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,250
don't so what else with money borrowing

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,020
money if you're getting started you

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,770
might be thinking I need that retina 5k

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,170
display

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,490
I need that Herman Miller chair I need

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,110
to rent an office so I can entertain

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:29,800
clients have meetings and all that stuff

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,990
don't borrow money . you don't need a

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,750
bunch of capital capital to get rolling

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,640
in this business you need a laptop you

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,500
need an internet connection some

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,560
software and some hustle you do not need

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,140
to borrow money chromatics been around

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,350
for ten years we have have and they have

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:51,160
always been debt-free and we have no

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,330
plans to borrow any money though i wish

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,940
i had borrowed some money when i was

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:58,560
living with my in-laws

00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,560
maybe I've gotten out of there sooner

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,550
so don't borrow money you might also be

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,860
thinking I need a credit line to buy

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,110
hardware for my employees that sort of

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,860
thing chromatic didn't have a credit

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,400
line until roughly 2015-2016 and to date

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,390
we've never used it

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,930
so if money is the first major

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,730
consideration with regards to starting

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,420
an agency I would say that people are a

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:28,060
close second and people are critical to

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,750
your organization I wish I'd realized

00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,800
this sooner and my good friend Jen Derry

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,710
she shared this quote with me recently

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,840
and it sort of it really resonated with

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,660
me that you are the average of the five

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,090
people you spend the most time with and

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,460
this is pretty obvious you know at least

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,690
in my personal life that I can make

00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,860
sense of that but I hadn't really

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:53,350
considered it in my professional life

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,830
and when I did I realized it was the

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,450
people that I surrounded myself with

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,820
intentionally that raised the level the

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,350
water level of my organization so

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,540
surround yourself with a plus human

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,880
beings and talented people sort of the

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,110
people you want to be like and it's

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,360
gonna make your organization better

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,440
they're gonna rub off on you and in turn

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,890
they're gonna rub off on your

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,510
organization these people might turn

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,220
into clients they'll turn it into

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,940
employees and they'll turn into

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,320
strategic strategic partners so network

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,250
network network this is getting back to

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,350
that core business development in it and

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,640
it's really interesting chromatics

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:37,060
history is deeply rooted in this

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:40,330
conference you have some water it was at

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,970
Drupal con Chicago or Dave look now

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,590
partner and managing director it was

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,390
where we first started talking about

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:52,530
joining forces it was at Rubicon Denver

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:56,350
where I first recruited Gus childs and

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:59,830
it was also a Drupal con Denver where we

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,000
hired Adam Zimmerman now these two these

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,040
last two that I just mentioned are our

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,860
longest tenured employees they're still

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,150
with us today they fundamentally shaped

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,880
this company and we

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,220
could've done it without them it was

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,550
also a DrupalCon Denver where we first

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,020
met mark Dorson Mark Dolson is now

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,890
partner and technical director at

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,540
chromatic Oh after years and years of

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,340
collaborating together and getting to

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,550
know each other sort of cultivating that

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,640
relationship at DrupalCon Austin over

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,390
many beers we talked about merging our

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,790
two companies and these things aren't

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,610
accidental these were carefully

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,740
maintained relationships these were the

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,170
five or so people that I was surrounding

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,460
myself with so this is some of that a

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,080
plus human beings I'm talking about

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,020
surround yourself with these people and

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,990
they're gonna become the people that

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:56,690
build your organization so when I'm

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,630
talking about people what I'm really

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,120
probably talking about its culture and

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,790
my friend Todd CEO and co-founder at

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:10,970
four kitchens who couldn't be bothered

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:12,620
to join the session I realize he talks

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,930
about culture really well in this quote

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,050
from a blog post awhile ago and he says

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:20,860
that company culture cannot be built or

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,210
bought culture emerges from attention

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,330
interaction in countless tiny moments

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:28,790
every day and what's hot is saying here

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:33,290
is that culture is not accidental it

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,940
requires real care day in and day out so

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,750
if I'm suggesting that culture is so

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,290
important to running your digital agency

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,930
what are the ways that you can

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,390
materially shape your culture I have a

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,890
few things that have worked well for us

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,480
but like I said this is sort of the

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,570
Cliff Notes version of the talk I'd like

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,610
to give so keep that in mind core values

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,850
write them down publish them on your

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,140
website you might think that you know

00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,760
what your company is all about what

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,620
you're all about as a human being is

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,740
obvious in your day to day interactions

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,880
with employees and clients but going

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,350
through the exercise of writing down

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,500
your core values it sort of makes them

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,150
real and it shares them with the world

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,760
beyond being a guiding light for you and

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,590
your company they will help others

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,250
identify with you be it potential

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,810
clients or potential employees that has

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,060
a real impact

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,350
your core values will also be a guiding

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,279
light when you need to make hard

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,870
decisions and there will be many and I

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,760
can't stress enough how many people have

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,800
come up to us and said like you guys

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,779
your core values they made a difference

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,910
when we were making a decision about

00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,550
either reaching out to you for work or

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,450
about applying to work at your company

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,400
these things really matter

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,420
they also matter for the people that

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,640
currently work for you

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,140
they are like sort of you're drawing a

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,860
line in the sand that this is who we are

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,360
it's really important you can also

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,089
materially shape your culture review an

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,550
employee handbook and a good employee

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,529
handbook like core values helps guide

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,350
your people it defines your policies and

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:06,080
processes of everything that your

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:11,570
business is and does and as your company

00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:13,070
starts to grow 1 to 2 2 to 4 4 to 8 more

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,170
and more of how things work and how you

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,570
want them done it needs to get out of

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,730
your head and into a handbook

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:23,480
I suggest you started early and adjust

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,250
it often like most things we waited way

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,020
too long to do this

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,510
I don't know how we survive without this

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,490
document and this can cover your core

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,050
values and cultural things it can also

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,910
cover like how do you request time off

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,200
that sort of thing these things really

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,130
matter and make it easier for your folks

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,480
to do things speaking of your folks I

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,450
think it's really important that you

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,150
provide really good benefits this is

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,860
another great way to shape your culture

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,970
you can really steer what your culture

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,980
and your organization is going to be

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,980
like but what are the benefits that you

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,540
offer so I suggest make them awesome and

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,000
offer them as soon as possible

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,520
and beyond being sort of the right thing

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,470
to do for your employees they believe

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,179
breath' loyalty and they help keep those

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,560
a plus human beings I talked about

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:11,510
clothes table stakes today you know with

00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,980
competition are really high you've got

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,449
to have good benefits to keep good

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,310
people

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,949
so today chromatic pays 100% of our

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,079
employees healthcare a percentage of

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,199
their dependents we have medical dental

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,520
disability insurance you name it but

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,660
more so we just treat everyone like

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,100
adults

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,420
and I think that has a really good

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,500
impact so your culture good or bad is

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,050
going to have a major impact on your

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,540
culture

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:41,630
all right so if money and people are

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,700
sort of the two biggest things I talked

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,610
about today that's sort of all companies

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,740
are right well let me just go through a

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,350
few things that I screwed up and make

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,940
sure that you don't so I'm gonna call

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,780
these details with the last few minutes

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:59,450
remaining legal you gotta have contracts

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,430
for all your work like full stop they

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,380
protect you they protect your business

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,720
and I hear my bit partner laughing

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,830
because we're 90% of the way through a

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,330
project right now and don't have a

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:13,070
contract signed so anyways if having if

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,260
you're just getting started in figuring

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,780
out how to draw up contracts or hiring

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,400
an attorney sounds expensive my friend

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,230
Dan mall is super friendly he's actually

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,970
open sourced his service agreement and

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,610
it's linked at the end of the deck which

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,850
I'll post online it's a start

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,310
so make sure you have contracts also

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,720
with regards to legal you can need an

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,110
operating agreement and a buy-sell

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,710
agreement you will thank me when the day

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,090
comes that you need these documents

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,070
partner buyouts are painful and I have

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,360
the scars to prove it

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,190
but even if you're the sole owner you

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,360
need an operating agreement this this is

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,370
document it's going to define what

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,200
happens if something happens to you what

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,700
happens to your company what happens to

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,340
your clients what happens to the money

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,340
in the bank you need to draw this up

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,570
bench players

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,830
these aren't full-time employees at

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,260
chromatic but they've been really

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,360
beneficial and really critical as we've

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,860
grown so what I'm talking about our your

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,890
attorneys your accountants your

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,660
bookkeepers if you can find folks with

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,770
expertise working with digital agencies

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,000
that's made a big difference for us also

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,980
in with regards to bench players

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,960
especially when you're getting started

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,830
and you're trying to do project work I

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,570
suggest finding trusted contractors find

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,850
some folks that can extend the

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,320
capabilities of your organization and be

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,570
force multipliers when you sign that

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,330
first big deal have folks that you can

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,820
tap to say hey we signed a big deal

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,890
whilst a farm we need to start a new pro

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,900
when you get together and run a new

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,100
company that's what happened with

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,460
chromatic

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,410
and don't forget these things well you

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,120
need some basic tools probably gonna

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,530
want to track time we use harvest we

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,330
love it

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,060
you need something right proposals for

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,020
sure we also use harvest but also have a

00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,220
custom tool that we built your need some

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,520
communication and project management

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,840
software we use slack email github I'm

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,860
sure most everyone this room has that

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,900
covered and last three things legal

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,030
compliance wherever you're set up to run

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,810
your business make sure you're legally

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,070
compliant this can come back to bite you

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,480
as your projects grow your going to

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,330
start dealing with attorneys at other

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,740
organizations they're most certainly

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,810
going to demand that you have errors in

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,390
omissions insurance make sure you get

00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,830
that it's not that expensive and it'll

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,400
be a leg up on others that you're

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,450
competing against in quarterly taxes at

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,980
least here in the States

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,280
there comes a time when you have to pay

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:46,730
quarterly taxes and the first time I

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,160
learned about this I was very late and

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:52,460
it was a very painful weekend so make

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:55,160
sure you know about quarterly taxes so

00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,200
money people and details that's what I

00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,060
wanted to cover today it's sort of the

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,850
Cliff Notes version again of the talk

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,220
I'd really like to give obviously

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,810
running a successful agency is really

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,890
hard building a company is really hard

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:12,770
and if I had some of this information

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,180
back in 2008 when I quit my job when I

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,480
walked into Andy's office and said hey

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,220
I'm out of here I probably wouldn't have

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,590
lived with my in-laws for as long as I

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,570
did so if you're interested in picking

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,230
my brain further come on up and say

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:30,440
hello or ask a question I'd love to

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,530
share more of what I know thanks for

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,609
listening

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,609
[Applause]

00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:47,159
I also like beers any questions shoot

00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,200
I'll happily read back the questions

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,529
people don't want to get up to the mic

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,029
and you said you have employees in

00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:03,700
different continents and different

00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:06,549
countries how do you manage the culture

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,409
and the fun part of benefits I know you

00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,599
paid benefits but the fun side of your

00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:12,070
culture when people are working remotely

00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,289
how do you involve me you know I

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,669
realized now I didn't mention if you

00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:20,559
don't know chromatic we're entirely

00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:23,859
remote we do a number of things like fly

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,090
everybody into Nashville and spend time

00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,259
together and go out to dinners and

00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,080
things like that we also do a team

00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:30,989
retreat every year it's last year we're

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,039
in Vermont we get everybody together

00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:35,049
kind of do a State of the Union and the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,389
company and then just spend three four

00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,879
days cooking food and in by being a

00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:42,519
little bit those are two the biggest

00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:45,039
ways for us you know we got slack we're

00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,769
connected we do zoom calls for all our

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,909
meetings we want to see you we want you

00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:53,499
to see us that sort of thing

00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:56,919
Coffee zoom Friday mornings we have a

00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:57,999
coffee zoom so it's sort of like just

00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,109
join the zoom if you want to hang out

00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:01,239
you're not in a meeting or anything else

00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:03,190
just we're all sitting here working and

00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:06,519
it's just sort of an open video

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:09,309
conference we end up talking about comic

00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,659
books and weightlifting and all kinds of

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,799
stuff you know it's sort of you get to

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:14,320
know people just like it's the

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,840
watercooler it's forced but it's you

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:24,609
know it's participation you know if you

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:26,710
want sort of thing thank you very much

00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:29,649
for sharing your experience I'm curious

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,330
if you can share some thoughts on when

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:34,840
you're taking that first step building a

00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:37,869
business starting an agency one idea is

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,399
how do you find someone and when someone

00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:42,519
who wants to get some work done from

00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:44,320
your agency and then if you do then the

00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,600
trepidation start can I deliver am i

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,060
pricing right can you

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:55,260
and thoughts on that you could start by

00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:56,700
being really young and dumb if I I find

00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,600
knew then what I know now I probably

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,480
would have done it I don't say that to

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,980
discourage anyone else from doing it but

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,630
I'm a really conservative individual

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:13,920
despite the three-quarter sleeve tattoo

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:15,540
so you know I would say like having some

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,400
courage and you know betting on yourself

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,130
is important you know if you can do the

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,230
work and somebody's like willing to pay

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,290
you money like give it a shot

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:37,730
what's the worst that happens so I you

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:43,260
know go for it man first starting up

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:45,390
looking to doing work for other more

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,860
established agency and you know if so

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,960
what's your thought and that did that

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,550
turn out to be worthwhile or is that

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,460
something that you would prefer to not

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:57,000
have done at all in the beginning it

00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:00,140
worked out we were the little brother to

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,190
agency you might have heard of la la ba

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:08,040
we it was just sort of deliberate to

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:10,110
sort of be small enough and good enough

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,960
that a company like Lal about would

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:17,970
trust us with their overflow work and in

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,380
doing so not only did we we didn't have

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,730
to focus so much on the biz dev we got

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,200
to focus on getting good so we were

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,620
starting to make money that sort of

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,570
thing

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,070
it was really beneficial for us until

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:35,430
about now when a company like all about

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,740
stops seeing us as a friend and more of

00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:43,800
an enemy

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:46,980
we're probably frenemies now but it's

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,610
co-op petition yeah if we had if we had

00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,360
spent all those years where we were

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,670
collaborating with other aids and she's

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,870
and we still do this we probably would

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,880
have been forced to learn a little bit

00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,360
more about biz dev and sort of building

00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,340
our own

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,460
and learning to swim on our own a lot

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,420
sooner but I don't say I don't think it

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,200
was really a mistake

00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,850
it's just now now that we're sort of no

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,360
longer the little brother were tall
