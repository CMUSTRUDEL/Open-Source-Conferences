Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: So You Want to Start Your Own Digital Agency?
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	The path to running a successful agency is riddled with obstacles, hoops to jump through, and laws to comply with - and that's all before you do the actual work. How about some real world advice from someone who transitioned from being a fledgling freelancer to a successful agency owner? It only took a decade of starts, stops, misfires and outright guesswork to get here.

This session is less of a success story and more of a guide to help would-be entrepreneurs and newly-minted agencies get started on the right foot. Rather than being a deep-dive into the HOW, this session will address the WHAT and WHY of the most critical considerations.

Attend this session and you'll come away armed to the teeth with (most) everything you need to run a successful digital agency. 

Some topics we'll cover:

Critical must-haves right out of the gate. What you need and don't need.
Strategies on transitioning from a one-man band to a team of producers.
Tools of the trade: building proposals, tracking expenses, running payroll.
Attracting the right talent.
Building culture.
