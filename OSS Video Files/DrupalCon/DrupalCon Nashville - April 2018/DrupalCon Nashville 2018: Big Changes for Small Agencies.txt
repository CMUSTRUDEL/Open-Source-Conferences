Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Big Changes for Small Agencies
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	In 2017 the second Drupal Business Survey was released with good news for businesses offering Drupal services. Drupal is growing steadily and Drupal 8 has a strong place in the market. But the survey also points to some trends that Drupal shops need to be aware of. For example the survey had this to say:

The evolution of the CMS marketplace to favor more comprehensive and thus also more complex solutions is favoring bigger companies with stronger competences through number of experts in specific fields. This can be a struggle for small vendors, as mastering clients’ needs requires more expertise than is available on their staff.

If the trend is truly towards larger businesses building enterprise level projects, how will smaller Drupal agencies survive? This session will discuss how the release of Drupal 8 and trends in the marketplace affect smaller Drupal agencies. We’ll look at how the release of Drupal 8 has changed our target market, and propose ways for smaller Drupal shops to thrive in this new environment.

How big is big?
What do we mean when we talk about larger businesses? How big is a large Drupal agency? What do we consider as small. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics 90% of companies are under 20 employees. There are only a few large Drupal service providers with over 500 employees. And while there are many Drupal agencies with over 20 employees, most businesses providing Drupal services are closer to 12 employees with the majority being microshops with 2 or 3 employees. Let’s look at agency sizes and how size may relate to competitiveness.

Enterprise Drupal
Yes the sophistication of Drupal 8 is more suited for larger projects and great for the enterprise. Let’s parse out what types of projects are more suitable, and where smaller Drupal shops can provide value. We'll look at some lessons learned from past experiences in the enterprise market, and make some connections with Drupal's enterprise aspirations.  

Higher Level of Entry
There’s a lot of talk going round about Drupal 8 demanding more technical expertise. Let's take a close look at the skills required to provide solutions with Drupal 8. What do these changes mean to site builders. What might smaller agencies do to survive the move to Drupal 8.

Drupal People
What do these trends mean for the Drupal community? This session will take a look at how trends might affect the Drupal community, contributions, and the Drupal labor pool. What are larger firms doing? What can smaller agencies learn from them.

hello my name is Daniel Schiavoni I'm a

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,480
partner at snake Hill web agency in

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:17,630
Baltimore I'm so happy to have you here

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,630
DrupalCon coming off that juries know

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,020
I'm I've been really freaking out

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,950
really freaking out last

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:36,670
year in Baltimore a Drupal Business

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:40,809
Survey came out and me and my partner

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,510
who is also my wife we've been talking

00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,040
about it ever since

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,600
disagreeing butting heads like business

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,190
partners and spouses will do

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,480
and

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,460
I'm happy to say that I'm freaking out

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,899
laughs after this morning's trees note

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,790
which is fantastic

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:08,270
and so and I'm happy to say that it

00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,270
seems like this discussion is relevant

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,979
yeah

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,979
so back as I mentioned last year

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,970
around the time of Baltimore DrupalCon

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,970
the Business Survey came out

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,000
and there were some poll quotes in the

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,890
survey and some data

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,890
and this is one of the poll quotes

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,840
kind of repeating a message that's been

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:48,880
in Drew's notes now for several years

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:54,830
that Drupal 8 is for bigger enterprise

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,540
projects sophisticated solutions however

00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,600
you want to word it and it's been a

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,520
message that's been hammered through

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:07,820
several times and then put into this

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:10,270
context of being a small agency started

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,270
to freak out

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,100
the Triple Business Survey 239 responses

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,090
40 different countries as you can see

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:27,010
mostly Europe

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:30,069
big chunk in Europe and in this lesson

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,100
Europe about two thirds in North America

00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,440
and the rest distributed and so I'm

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,310
interesting if you haven't taken a look

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,310
definitely take a look at this

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,290
so it made me think about what you know

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,220
we're saying that I'm gonna go back to

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,190
the quote

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,560
the evolution of the CMS marketplace to

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,930
favor more comprehensive and thus also

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,550
more complex solutions is favoring

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,640
bigger companies with stronger

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:03,340
competencies through a number of experts

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,420
in specific fields this can be a

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,150
struggle struggle for smaller vendors as

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,310
mess as mastering clients needs requires

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,700
more expertise than is available on

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,700
their staff

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:23,760
so what do we mean by big and what do we

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:27,090
mean by small so this is a data from the

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,130
Bureau of Labor Statistics showing the

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,810
distribution of small companies and

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,100
large companies based on number of

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,830
employees and as you can see over half

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:43,050
the companies out there are are small

00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,480
very few are the larger

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,570
companies so 90% of companies are under

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,740
20 employees the average business

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:55,170
generates 1.1 million in sales and has

00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,450
about four employees and pays the

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,880
average compensation of 41,000 now it's

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,580
across many industries not necessarily

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,500
technology small and medium-sized

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,820
business businesses account for 50

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,240
percent of employment in the United

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,240
States

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,900
so there are some trends going on in the

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,700
past few years with businesses and we've

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,690
all noticed this with very large

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:23,790
companies like Walmart Amazon Facebook

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:26,800
and in the tech tech industries

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:32,250
companies smaller than 500 employees the

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:35,800
the firm size actually shrank the past

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,110
since 2001 so on average they used to be

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,240
19 out of 13 so small companies are

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,470
getting smaller new businesses are

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,470
starting to stay small

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,490
the average size of companies with

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,780
between 500 and 10,000 employees has has

00:04:51,490 --> 00:05:00,180
grown tremendously 35% during those 10

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,010
years on average 2200 employees

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,220
let's bring this back to the drupal

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,220
world

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:12,060
how do we measure ourselves in the

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,670
Drupal world under 20 I would say is a

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,950
break point because at 20 you're at

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,360
direct supervision it means I own the

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,130
company or I own the company with

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,160
partner we are directly supervising

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:27,630
everyone in the company somewhere

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,000
between 20 and 50 in order to grow my

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,070
company and I've been at this point

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,390
before but the previous company that

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:39,150
helped start we were four of us the

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,910
first year we did half a million in

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,390
sales second year we were twelve we did

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:49,320
1.2 million in sales the third year we

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:53,690
were around 20 we did 2.2 million in

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,690
sales and then things got complicated

00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:01,679
so between 20 or 50 the supervisors have

00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:04,079
to start supervising other supervisors

00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:06,809
and that's where it gets complicated and

00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,459
some of you may be at that breakpoint or

00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:16,019
may have come across that before

00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:18,059
next step is 50 to 100 where the the

00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,339
business owners are really disengaging

00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:23,999
from the business they're focused on

00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:27,259
growth they're disengaged in direct

00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,259
operations I should say

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:33,139
somewhere around 100 and 500 you become

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,330
divisional where is that the

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,509
organization is so big you have to have

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,369
division heads and the and we start to

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,090
split up and then over 500 we're

00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:45,130
considered possibly global

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:49,250
so I think these are good break points

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,290
to use with the Drupal community

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,140
so what's the size and the Drupal

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,750
ecosphere this is data pulled together

00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:00,560
from the Drupal marketplace on

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,360
drupal.org now there's some caveats here

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,490
of course you know we're working with

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,210
anytime you you look at data you kind of

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,770
- you know parse it but also be critical

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,630
at looking at it so we're counting

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,120
Drupal accounts associated with

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,450
businesses we're not we're not including

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,310
people in organizations who are not

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,170
registered on drupal.org and having the

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,300
association some of these associations

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,480
might be out of date but I think the

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,580
data gives us a pretty accurate picture

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,350
of the lay of the land in a Drupal

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,890
community this is also out of the nine

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:40,840
hundred and fifty six organizations in

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:44,390
the marketplaces is it I only got to 502

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,820
County after that sometime as you go

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,419
through the marketplace the numbers are

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,960
stayed pretty small organizations of

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:56,270
single-person to people under six but

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,880
the trend continues here so I would say

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:03,919
with this data some of the largest are

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:06,890
probably larger so you know they would

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,319
have more support staff they might be in

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:13,729
diverse business ventures marketing etc

00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,500
but overall I think this is a good

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,900
picture of the label and what's

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
interesting here

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,529
is that

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,529
[Music]

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,830
the majority of community works for

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,829
small shops 74% of the drupal community

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,339
provide service providers have 20

00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:40,589
employees or less and less than 2% of

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,680
drupal service providers have over 200

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,680
employees

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,870
and the focus of the largest of the

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,390
Drupal organization are in hosting

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,660
marketing and consulting and by

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:59,050
consulting I would say most of that is

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:03,510
placing placement

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,510
placing expertise within

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,249
go back

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:16,900
and of this 1200

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,930
there's our six and under

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,320
that's pretty remarkable there 74% of

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,320
you

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,210
good chocolate

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,890
they're starting the supervisors

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,370
supervise

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:50,050
so it fits in with the overall data from

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:50,050
the Bureau of Labor Statistics which is

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,829
which leads me

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,119
it's a pretty accurate vision

00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,119
so small agencies

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,160
how accurate is this current narrative

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,160
that we're hearing

00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:12,749
the Business Survey how accurate is that

00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:15,600
narrative and I think today at the

00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:17,820
reason I was really happy that the

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,680
narrative shifted

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:25,100
and a more positive direction at least

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:27,770
for a person who owns a small Jubilee

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,700
how do we rally the majority of Drupal

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,190
service providers to drive Drupal growth

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,740
and grow our businesses and how does

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,080
this majority thrive with Drupal 8 so

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,080
let's talk about a few things let's talk

00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,070
about enterprise software this is the

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,610
image from altered carving these are the

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,610
the clouds

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,240
okay what is enterprise software because

00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:01,830
here's some definitions satify satisfies

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:04,500
satisfies the needs of an organization

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,470
rather than individual users business

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,190
oriented tools tends to cost more and

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,300
the complexity needs specialists to

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,870
implement

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:20,180
I thought these this was an interesting

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,980
take on the differences here this person

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,710
points out that the enterprise purchased

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:29,029
a lot purchases a lot of software and a

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:33,020
lot of that software is not necessarily

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:36,190
enterprise software and the distinction

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:44,540
is that enterprise software is is

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:46,400
purchased by a c-level manager or person

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,850
in the organization often a

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,830
non-technical person again comforting to

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,130
see in the DRI's note that there's a

00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,760
focus on that and it's purchased for the

00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,760
entire enterprise

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,210
so how do people sell enterprise

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,760
software so Aqua is selling to the

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,860
enterprise they have to target c-level

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,190
decision-makers they engage through

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,850
salespeople they have longer sales

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:22,070
cycles pay annually rather than monthly

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:25,460
add-ons upsells focus on big deals but

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:30,270
there's this thing called the consumer a

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:32,550
consumerization of IT and that has

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,820
certainly accelerated with the advent of

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:38,850
smartphones and tablets and and the

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,150
ubiquity of electronic devices within

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,820
the home so with the average American

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,730
adult spending more than 60 hours per

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:51,150
week on a digital device expectations

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,500
change and they go to work it affects

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,500
the way they see enterprise software

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:59,040
so we have disruption of processes

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,710
processes we see this

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,500
bring-your-own-device

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,720
we've seen it with Barack Obama couldn't

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,480
have his BlackBerry anymore when he went

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,110
to the White House you go to work for

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,660
IBM or a big enterprise you have to have

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,779
their computer be on a VPN that kind of

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,550
thing

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,410
consistency of user experience

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:26,130
expectations are higher we tend to

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:28,200
multiple multiple devices I think having

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,150
a work phone and a home phone is

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,500
becoming less and less more people using

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:37,140
their private phone for work there's

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:43,980
easier sharing and and we're really

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:45,779
expecting better UI's overall so even

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,670
though we might be focused on enterprise

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,230
market consumer market is pretty

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,850
important because there's faster

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,290
innovation there's higher bar for

00:13:50,850 --> 00:14:00,839
usability and it's a big market

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:03,630
influence consumers are Enterprise

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,480
decision-makers and you see this all the

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,270
time where business owners they have an

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,209
experience they experience software and

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:16,430
their private lives they expect the

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,430
similar experience in the workplace

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,390
often enterprise businesses all

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:25,250
businesses have mixed environments and

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,250
there's crossover applications

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:32,590
so let me tell you a story of enterprise

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,590
software

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,899
there was this enterprise software

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,480
called Lotus Notes and you may or may

00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:46,589
not be familiar with it and my ELISA had

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,130
grown from you last year at Baltimore

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:51,450
DrupalCon

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:55,200
I got Kevin petit who is known as in the

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,800
Lotus world as Lotus guru who runs a

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,550
blog Lotus guru calm to come to Juba con

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,310
Baltimore trying to lure him to the open

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:09,570
source community let me tell you about

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:13,290
the story so I was group where the idea

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:17,970
was to connect people involved email and

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:19,800
databases individuals within the

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,990
enterprise could create their own

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,610
databases there were professionals they

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,730
are creating databases creating

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:29,940
workflows there are some interesting

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,670
technical achievements among the product

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,850
it was highly secured use public key

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,800
encryption so your head have the key

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,399
sound familiar you had to have the key

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,860
on your local computer it had to match

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,589
with the public key on the server in

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,380
order for you to do anything we're

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:56,690
talking when I got involved with Lotus

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,690
Notes it was early 90s maybe 92 but it

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:06,620
you had keep in mind this is enterprise

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:09,870
email software so you had the file size

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,480
compared to Outlook Outlook had a size

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:16,620
limit Lotus Notes didn't it didn't

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,720
matter it had an innovative flat file

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,760
database before its time now we talk

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:26,730
about no sequel it's kind of a trend

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:28,470
thing back then it was didn't matter it

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,810
was more performant email server and

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,420
needed less hardware you stood up

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:37,110
exchange environment you needed three

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:40,550
four servers it couldn't handle the load

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:46,560
as well as their server didn't matter

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:48,740
and in the end consumer software outlook

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,830
that was installed on every Windows

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,080
machine out there overtook it it drove

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,260
the expectations and the purchasing

00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,709
decisions at the management level so

00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:05,760
what does this have to do a triple let's

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:09,929
look at market share and this is the

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,370
trend between March 1st 2017 and March

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:18,689
1st 2018 so this is pretty current data

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:22,500
this is WordPress with 60% of the CMS

00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:26,189
market share and growing next down there

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:32,179
we have Joomla which is in decline and

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,179
we have Drupal which is in decline

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,700
so we keep saying let's stop comparing

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,940
Drupal and WordPress we're not competing

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,390
with WordPress I think we've been wrong

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,870
for several years now we are in direct

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:52,330
competition with WordPress

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,880
yes software-as-a-service is a factor a

00:17:52,330 --> 00:18:01,720
lot of this is off of sites like

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:04,450
WordPress calm and but WordPress is

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,810
entering the enterprise market it's

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,720
starting to nibble at the edges yes our

00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:13,950
technology is better as you can see in

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,190
the previous slide that doesn't matter

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:20,590
and WordPress has a large community that

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,010
if it was mobilized to actually fix the

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,350
things are wrong with WordPress would be

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:33,040
a formidable opponent in the enterprise

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:37,180
market let's take a closer look so a lot

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,920
of what's the chatter about Drupal being

00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,440
enterprise software and competing the

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,330
enterprise market talks about competing

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,180
with these two guys site core CMS an

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:55,090
adobe experience manager

00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:59,830
there's Drupal with our 4.5 ish % of CMS

00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:02,610
market share in decline and we want to

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,610
be those guys

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,500
so

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,080
yeah let that sink in alright let's

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,090
let's talk more about enterprise market

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,660
so they're probably software market is

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:25,950
complicated selling to enterprise is

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:30,660
complicated you're you have to sell to

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:36,390
someone who's authorized to spend six

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:38,540
figures ish and more consumer market

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,370
influences that enterprise market and

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:46,410
influences that influences those

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:51,660
non-technical decision makers and giving

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:54,720
up ground and the CMS marketplace would

00:19:51,660 --> 00:20:00,830
be a tremendous risk right now for the

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:03,300
Drupal ecosystem and I would say that

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:07,730
enterprise software the difference is

00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,730
might be more social than technical

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:16,890
so enterprise Drupal you might have seen

00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:22,350
I think this exact chart was in Adreno

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:25,890
in Baltimore it's showing Acquia up here

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:30,320
with psych core an adobe experience

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,320
manager competing in that quadrant

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,600
so this this chart I've struggled with

00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:43,169
this this graph for a while the first

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,919
thing that people noticed that it talked

00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:52,889
we are not Drupal and and I guess that's

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:54,869
consistent with most of the graph but

00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:57,480
overall I've come to accept this it's

00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:59,490
this this is good for Drupal it measures

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,320
the Ock but it measures the aqua

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:06,860
platform and not just Drupal Drupal is

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,340
the center of aqueous business strategy

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:17,070
but yours your business strategy and

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,659
mine is different and we have to think

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:24,240
through how Drupal fits into our

00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:27,090
strategy and I would point out there's a

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,350
reason why the top three sponsors at the

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:33,889
cons are hosting companies and Drupal

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,889
agencies

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:43,610
so the differences between aqueon

00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:47,809
business strategy as I mentioned as a

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:50,149
small Drupal agency small medium sized

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,799
our business strategy has to be

00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:55,570
different

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:59,659
it can include enterprise sales

00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:03,950
enterprise clients but it probably

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:07,909
includes more than that our resources

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:12,049
are different as we saw earlier most of

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:15,860
us are under 20 employees and a good

00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:19,850
many of us a major majority are really

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,980
under around 40 50 so we're smaller our

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,320
resources are different our target

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,279
market may be different there may be

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,169
overlap but it's different and certainly

00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:33,980
our value proposition how we sell

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:36,309
ourselves is different than how the

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,570
biggest organizations sell themselves

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:42,159
the good thing is I think there are

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,159
enough opportunities to go around

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,640
so here's more from the business survey

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:55,890
there is no easy work left and many

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,450
people who came in during the good times

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,240
will not be able to sustain their

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:03,630
careers in the new world i I was

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,299
freaking out when I write I'm a

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:10,049
technical person so I'm not afraid a

00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:13,820
composer or the command line but there's

00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:17,429
something that would be quite a pivot

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:21,419
considering the trends we saw with

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:26,929
Drupal 7 you know it made me feel like

00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,929
Milton I'm being left out

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:34,349
so let's let's tackle this was Drupal 7

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:34,349
all that easy

00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:40,239
site building did become a thing you

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:44,379
know we had site builders they could be

00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:46,719
a bit less technical than some of the

00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:50,469
other people in the organization they

00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:53,649
could do useful work to stand up Drupal

00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:56,080
sites we had panels and things like that

00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:58,929
there were front-end tools then didn't

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,580
have a lot of command line so my

00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:07,419
question is well Jubilate who's it hard

00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,399
for certainly you know is it site

00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:12,009
builders programmers themers I would say

00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:16,509
theming experience much better user

00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:20,859
experience better needs work site

00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:23,049
builder experience it's we're working on

00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:26,200
it we see it in the DRI's note right we

00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:29,169
have all these layout tools program

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,769
experience yeah okay if I'm a I'm a I'm

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:35,289
a command-line programmer it's a little

00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,789
more complicated right but that's what

00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:40,719
we love right that's why we're

00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:42,849
programmers so you also saw this in the

00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:46,599
and the DRI's note this is from matthew

00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:52,029
Grasmick and so you've all familiar with

00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:55,119
what's going on here so it's great that

00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:56,889
we're gonna address this obstacle you

00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,429
know it's it's definitely a serious

00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:04,900
obstacle but I would also question for a

00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:09,020
project between 50k 200k

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,780
around that range how big of a obstacle

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,730
is this right you've got a team of

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:17,630
developers working on a site for six

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:20,900
months they've got what was it put it

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,970
end up being 41 clicks this morning they

00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,390
they click through 41 times one time

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,760
there's a site up you know they're very

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,880
good to go we start work we have six

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,670
months more work after that it's

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,490
certainly a barrier in the evaluation

00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,430
and again it's it's comforting to know

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,800
that that's being addressed some of

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,110
these drupal paradox that exists right

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,030
we want to lower the required skills we

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,040
want lower skills because that lowers

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,010
cost is a business owner how many people

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,190
are business owners here great good all

00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:59,120
right so we all know our biggest costs

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:02,030
being a service provider is labor so if

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,090
we can lower the skill set and pay a

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:09,020
little less for labor that leaves us

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:11,240
with more profit for growth right but

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:15,770
we're raising complexity which raises

00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:20,360
required skills which raises the costs

00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:22,820
of a cost of skills

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,110
so those two things we seem to have a

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,240
paradox going on

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:30,080
we wanted to dribble to be easy to use

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,419
but we keep making it more complicated I

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,549
think you know that's oversimplification

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:36,230
I think we're making some strides in

00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:40,190
some areas Drupal 7 was supposed to be a

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,500
user experience release yeah I mean

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,210
quite hit the mark

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,919
Jubilees I do believe

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,390
Drupal 8 is heading in the right

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,720
direction we've got some great things

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,700
going on there we build stuff for site

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,799
builders but we tell them do blades not

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,480
their thing I think this is the most

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,490
serious thing that's been going on the

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,090
past few years since the release

00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:04,100
interplay so we keep we keep harping on

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:08,539
this thing that Drupal 8 is hard it's

00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:11,059
for enterprise websites sophisticated

00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:15,440
user experiences which you can take it

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:21,769
you know that's that's fair how do we

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:24,409
how we parse that so we don't want to

00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:27,260
depend on this guy this is kind of what

00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:31,429
I'm saying I actually worked with

00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:34,519
someone who would do this you know be

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:35,809
coding and you know I'm a god you know

00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,909
that kind of thing we don't want to

00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:43,580
depend on this guy because that guy ends

00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:45,740
up like that then there's the community

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,470
in the long tail of Drupal contribution

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,289
we don't let's think about this long

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,820
tail in a different way because in the

00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:54,740
past we've

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,900
we've thought about the long tail is a

00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:00,110
bad thing how to shorten the tail get

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:03,140
more people doing more commits but we

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:06,560
need that long tail that long tail isn't

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:11,980
out there we don't have the spike at the

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,980
very end of the tail become shorter

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:26,600
so the Drupal community individuals and

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:28,460
small shops we create Drupal talent how

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,889
many people started how many stories

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:34,610
have we heard there was a story during

00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:36,370
the DRI's note up and I started playing

00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:39,590
around with it I found that I could

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:42,980
install Drupal that I could like I could

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,649
work with the CSS I don't have a

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:49,129
computer science degree you know we've

00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:51,320
heard that story many times so small

00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:55,639
shops individuals are really important

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:58,220
for creating Drupal talent small shops

00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:02,809
make contributions to corn contribs

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:05,539
see many core contributors around that

00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:08,899
are working for themselves or working

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:12,200
for smaller organizations smaller shops

00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:16,730
drive adoption by giving a bigger

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:20,649
footprint to the product and small shops

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,649
more importantly so a lot of Drupal

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:28,990
so being small there's no comforting

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,450
side note there is no correlation

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:37,930
between bigger companies getting bigger

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:42,360
and smaller companies closing so there's

00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:45,360
no direct correlation you can say that

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,360
yeah

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:58,690
so let's look at some positive things

00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:03,010
ployment amongst web developers is on

00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:05,250
the rise expected to grow 15% the next

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,250
10 years

00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:13,289
we've got the social media ad spending

00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:15,750
is suspected the past newspapers in 2020

00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:17,789
somebody's our industry drivers 1

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:23,460
million Drupal 7 sites will need to be

00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:27,600
migrated in the near future around 46%

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,490
of web sites do not use a CMS you know a

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,620
half a small businesses do not have a

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,470
web site majority of web sites are still

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:38,039
not mobile-friendly and this bottom one

00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:40,950
got cut off but basically Congress in

00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,539
late December pests the connected

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,620
government Act which requires all

00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:50,760
federal agencies that create or redesign

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:53,130
their web sites for public used to be to

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,750
the greatest extent possible to be

00:30:53,130 --> 00:31:01,289
mobile friendly so there's a lot of work

00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:04,100
to be done here and small/medium triples

00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:09,419
Drupal agencies are there to do it

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:11,299
there's also the mid-market they tend to

00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:15,289
be a hundred to five hundred employees

00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:18,419
ten million to 1 billion annual revenue

00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:21,090
they make technology purchases and they

00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:25,019
tend to focus on functionality reporting

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:27,330
capabilities and if this market were its

00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:30,029
own country it would be the fourth

00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:33,960
largest economy in the world so the

00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:36,600
small medium business market and in the

00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,899
in Europe is referred to the small

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,230
medium enterprise market is pretty

00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,230
substantial

00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:53,020
so how do we compete against the bigger

00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:55,540
Drupal agencies well we make size our

00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:59,950
strength right flexibility speed nimble

00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,420
we were personal a lot of a lot of

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,180
business owners a lot of business

00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:09,100
managers like talking to the owner to

00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:12,520
the boss we make that personal we're

00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:16,390
local a lot of people will select make

00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:19,120
their selection based on you know I can

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,610
actually meet with you in person that's

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,910
a selling point we can be unique in our

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:30,420
own ways and we can also work with the

00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:30,420
larger larger businesses

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:39,030
and selling our small agency Drupal as

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:42,210
around you know there's several places

00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:44,520
where we can sell around of being nimble

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:48,180
with our design and builds personalized

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,550
support you know there are some areas

00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,130
you need to diversify in might be

00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,110
content marketing there might be things

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:59,160
that you can focus in specialize in like

00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:01,130
upgrades and migrations and being the

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,540
consultant being the shock troops

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:10,380
dropping it especially I was talking to

00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:13,980
a person who as a freelancer yesterday

00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:17,880
and just talking about how he can drop

00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:22,980
in either to another large agency or to

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,930
a client to solve a problem for a period

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,680
of time and then move on to the next

00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:32,150
place to solve a problem and that's what

00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:36,870
we can do is is small Drupal agencies

00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:41,420
and we can also leverage complementary

00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:45,000
technologies so you know we show clients

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,280
you know things like MailChimp looking

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,110
at analytics that kind of thing being

00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:54,650
the cones consultants being the rebbe

00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:54,650
web strategist for their business

00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:04,670
so in conclusion don't panic

00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,600
we're open source you can stay involved

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:16,500
let your voice be heard contribute help

00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:21,720
to steer the ship I think I think it's

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:23,940
small and medium sized Drupal agencies I

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,700
think we need to be more active and more

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:32,250
vocal we need to get our message out

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:36,060
it'd be great to see some sort of

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:39,869
initiated initiative around growing this

00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:44,369
core Drupal market the cord ripple

00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:49,379
service providers 74% of the triple o

00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:52,800
Drupal community so it'd be great to see

00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:55,649
that conversation continue and we're in

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,650
demand and Drupal has always been for

00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:02,820
the enterprise it's never been a tool to

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:04,080
build restaurant sites right some of

00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,850
that might have been going on but it's

00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,750
never been really suited for that so

00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:12,810
it's in many ways there's nothing new so

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,850
there's some related talks going on

00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:20,250
tomorrow you might want to check out in

00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:22,830
defense of small Drupal I think this is

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:28,609
more technical oriented how to improve

00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:32,490
Drupal and make it more suitable for for

00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:35,940
you know easier for people implement for

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:39,990
individuals to lower the barriers to

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,280
entry now we have wordpress vs. drupal

00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,910
how the website industry is evolving

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,190
that's Zack frozen from pantheon half

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,010
the sights on Pantheon they're 200 sites

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:54,600
on 200,000 sights on Pantheon half of

00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:57,000
them are WordPress but I bet they they

00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,450
haven't taken a chip out of WordPress

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,329
calm yet so it's very interesting and I

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:05,430
think they have

00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:10,170
by doing that was a very smart move on

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:14,749
their part I mean that's and and I'd

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:18,349
love to talk more around around that

00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:22,200
we've heard a lot of fur a lot about

00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:25,410
again and the Drupal Business Survey

00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:30,539
they talk about agencies doing more

00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:34,739
WordPress to kind of useful them the

00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:38,279
smaller sites and I I understand the

00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:40,049
logic behind that I don't understand

00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:44,420
yeah there's something there's something

00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:44,420
not that it's not jiving with

00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:52,080
alright so references these are some

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:53,730
posts out there Drupal is the worst

00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,260
content management system except for all

00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,560
those other solutions that's a really

00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,840
great place to start to find out more

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,540
about this topic we've got another other

00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,910
decent post have we reached peak Drupal

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,590
so this is a conversations happening out

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:11,190
in the community and I think it's I

00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:13,650
think it's being heard I think it was

00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,540
interesting at the DRI's know Matthew

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:20,220
Grasmick getting a shot a major

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,420
shout-out for his work there some of

00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,340
these other posts so people are

00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,660
listening so it's a very important had

00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,120
that conversation having that

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,920
conversation out in public to improve

00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:34,100
things and again I think the DRI's note

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:38,130
really calmed some of my freaking out

00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:43,550
for the past year so I'll open this up

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,550
for questions or discussion yes sir

00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,290
that was at the pantheon partner

00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,700
yesterday so I think I've already seen

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,230
what Zacks going to talk about and you

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,820
should go do it there were some really

00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,140
interesting insights okay

00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,940
especially with you don't have it again

00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,620
all those wordpress and drupal on one

00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,870
platform i think we're seeing some

00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,430
things that you know an aqua it wasn't

00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:13,670
seen because they don't have the site

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,059
into wordpress cool

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,819
a mite out small business come on Joe

00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:20,770
dude

00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:23,240
Daniel that was great

00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,710
I've been stressing a little ass to

00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,410
myself yeah we probably should've got a

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,000
coffee a year ago but I wanted to say

00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:32,000
that I you know without I don't know

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,589
it's a very small sampling that's survey

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,240
but certainly some need to be attended

00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:37,490
to and you wonder who sent it out was it

00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,680
driven by a major hosting provider that

00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:43,400
has a very heavily heavy influence in

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,079
the in the Drupal community or but two

00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,540
things that I think resonated from what

00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,150
you had said was first working with

00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,430
larger businesses I think is helping a

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,490
small agency like mine because there's

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,700
so much more than just Drupal now that

00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:01,130
companies are looking for or web CMS and

00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,890
then this so that's a positive thing I

00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,260
think also selling our subject matter

00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,140
matter expertise or situational fluency

00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,030
if you're a small agency you know that

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,980
gravitas of the original founder that's

00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,660
been doing this for a long time

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,690
something very hard for large

00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,490
enterprises to you know to try to copy

00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,770
when they're going in and talking with a

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,809
prospect and then on the other side

00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:27,099
which I wanted to hear more about we've

00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:29,930
seen in the last six months a lot more

00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:32,569
prospects they're wanting to go to

00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:36,079
WordPress

00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:37,339
which was surprising you know to us

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,989
because we haven't seen as much we don't

00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:40,279
do WordPress and then a lot more

00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:42,589
customers are saying well they want to

00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:45,650
do a site core epi server so it's almost

00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:46,880
like a return to 10-15 years ago and I

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,449
wondered if other people were seeing the

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,099
same kind of a thing you know we're in

00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:56,599
New York City agency but we do operate

00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:58,789
all around the the East Coast yeah I

00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:02,179
don't have any additional data for that

00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:05,029
I've you know I was curious about the

00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:07,219
sampling size and when I saw that Europe

00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:09,499
was so well represented among said

00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:12,789
sampling I know that some of the people

00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:16,640
work on the survey where you're based I

00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:19,039
wonder if that had an influence I I

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,559
think we can get the raw data and I'd be

00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:25,130
interested in taking a look at that it

00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:28,869
also shows the you know when you when

00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:32,199
you do pull quotes from respondents I

00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:35,269
wonder what's the best practice for that

00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,819
you know because you you're focusing in

00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:39,979
on something you're making a subjective

00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:41,569
decision when you pull something out

00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:45,979
like that

00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:48,109
which makes me question in it and as far

00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:49,969
as the competitive market I do think I

00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:52,929
do think we got to look at the full

00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:55,699
spectrum I don't think we can say

00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:59,269
WordPress is for blogs it's not a factor

00:40:55,699 --> 00:41:01,159
because it is major factor and we're

00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:04,640
we're seeing it we're seeing encroaching

00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:07,069
in on exist you know Drupal sites being

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,959
replaced WordPress WordPress doing

00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:10,549
larger sites and we know all the

00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:14,269
technical difficulties with that but

00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:16,789
like a like I mentioned earlier it's not

00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:18,140
about the decision makers at that point

00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,509
are not

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:23,119
technical they're not making technical

00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:25,569
decisions you can have a they you have a

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,859
product that's worse technically a

00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:30,650
probably is better and that is not

00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:32,599
necessarily a factor depending on the

00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:35,289
Advocate who's advocating it within the

00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,289
organization

00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:43,119
I was thinking about something lately

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,220
that I think may be summarized as a key

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,780
pain point that our small agency has

00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:50,140
professionally had and wondering if you

00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:53,710
had thoughts are very advice on it in

00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:57,220
being a small agency doing Drupal and

00:41:53,710 --> 00:42:00,069
therefore large projects we're doing

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,730
these big thousand several thousand our

00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:06,339
engagements is our typical kind of thing

00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:09,569
we are always seemingly in the situation

00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:13,720
of not having much redundancy in our

00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:17,680
active client base so we can become very

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:19,900
dependent on whatever large project

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,800
we're actively doing yesterday at the

00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,599
Business Summit the guys from Summit

00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,329
accounting agency said they try to make

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,359
sure all their clients wearable agencies

00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,829
do not rely on any particular customer

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,369
for more than 10 percent of their

00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:38,079
revenue which is a lovely goal how I

00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:42,000
possibly achieve it and it seems like

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,000
who's there for an inherent

00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:49,230
malalignment of being a small shop if

00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,300
you're doing large projects if we were

00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,670
much larger number of people we could

00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,800
have a much larger number of large

00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:59,250
projects going on simultaneously and

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,830
then if one you know gets plugged polar

00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:04,560
driver we're not dependent on it do you

00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:06,270
see that as an actual configuration to

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,360
resources for this there's a book called

00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:11,460
the e-myth revisited and our business

00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,040
consultant has assigned it to us right

00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,220
off the bat it talks about this

00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,730
dependency on one large client and and

00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:23,550
how how what a negative effect that can

00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,740
have on your business and number two is

00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:29,040
last year at Drupa con Baltimore there

00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,440
was a session that Jam did it was down

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,190
on the product floor he did it with the

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,100
head of typo3 and they talked about SLA

00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:40,140
is telling us LA's service level

00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:44,960
agreements right and that's really the

00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:44,960
business aqua isn't enterprise s always

00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:50,489
and Pantheon is in that business and

00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:53,489
guess what we're in that business too so

00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:56,069
if you have a retainer with a client

00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:58,829
you're giving them an SLA you're saying

00:43:56,069 --> 00:44:01,649
okay you've got this site it's it's

00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:04,130
complicated we're supporting that site

00:44:01,649 --> 00:44:07,169
and that's a I think that's a good

00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:13,019
regular stream of income and you can do

00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:15,179
things with that by saying okay you know

00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:17,999
not only you have keeping the site up

00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:20,099
and running but how can we increase

00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:24,539
traffic of the site how can we help you

00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:27,389
manage content for the site is you know

00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:29,880
you you do I do you think there's a need

00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:31,769
to diversify whether that's within your

00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,159
organization over the partners to offer

00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:37,859
other services like online content

00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:41,609
marketing certainly the support

00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:44,999
agreements I think the days of us

00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:47,789
managing hosting if certain you know

00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:50,159
that that's a high risk in my mind but

00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:54,289
you can white label things so platform

00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:58,439
SH has a wonderful program for agencies

00:44:54,289 --> 00:45:01,319
now the big three hosting options

00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:03,599
there's is the most technically complex

00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:06,479
but it's also the most

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,969
of the three by nuna I do know that

00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:11,309
Pantheon is restructuring their hosting

00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:13,920
agreements so if there's a gap you know

00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:16,999
you get the $25 starter and you've got

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,789
$100 then you got $400 and then you have

00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:23,160
$12,000 it's like it

00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:25,680
there's clients in between that and I

00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:29,910
think that's and I think there's for us

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,739
and for larger agencies there are

00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:35,609
clients who are in between like our

00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:40,589
target is 50 to 200 thousand that's our

00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:43,289
that's our sweet spot right so yeah

00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:47,119
creating that was I don't know if we'll

00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:50,009
ever get to 10% you know we'll always be

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,739
always have that stress I think I think

00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:56,369
that's probably unrealistic until you

00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:59,190
get up to that 30 40 50 employee level a

00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:00,869
lot of us decide not to do that I don't

00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,549
want to be that big I've been there

00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:05,339
before I've been to that inflection

00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:07,170
point we're at 24 employees we had a

00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:10,170
chief operating officer we had two

00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:15,029
salespeople I was managing eight nine

00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:17,880
people at a time which is that's your

00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:22,559
maxed out at that point my partner's

00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:24,719
were managing X amount of people we were

00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,999
we were doing great but it suddenly

00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,739
changed and we were we were gonna change

00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:30,420
into a body shop we at that point I

00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:31,709
wasn't doing Drupal up I was doing we

00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,430
were doing I was in charge of the

00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:36,900
software all the software development

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,339
and we were changing into a body shop

00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,279
and that's another business model

00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:43,469
placing people and seats and that's what

00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:45,900
a lot of the bigger organizations are

00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:48,290
doing especially around our area and

00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:51,680
Baltimore Washington with all those

00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:55,520
federal work is a placing those where

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,810
they call them FTEs you know but that's

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,480
not a business they interest me

00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:04,450
I mean I like the creative part which is

00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:07,960
the high-risk part unfortunately yeah

00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,980
anybody else's be great a more

00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,619
conversation certainly after this would

00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,170
love to find a way to do this after oh I

00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:17,330
came here from Ukraine so I'm interested

00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,640
in about cooperation between agencies

00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,790
right so for example I'm working kind of

00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,109
a big company but through Paul direction

00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,600
started just I think three four years

00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:28,070
ago and in my CT I mean small cities so

00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,320
we just started team from three people

00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:32,119
and we grow two team of ten people

00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,070
during the year and what is interesting

00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,930
experience which we have this is that we

00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:38,480
are looking for small cities like

00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:41,930
regional cities in Ukraine and we kind

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,060
of trying to build cooperation between

00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:46,070
agencies so for example we help strong

00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,690
on one direction it wasn't pretty

00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,940
mention about subject matter expertise

00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:52,070
right so we have like strong bas

00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,900
requirements managers but Drupal is what

00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,690
we're development of example vice versa

00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,760
and then when we joined together we can

00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:00,710
do actually big a project for bigger

00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,700
enterprise or like so for anybody

00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:08,240
because when small agencies like

00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:10,190
cooperation they becoming like big team

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,109
with still independent

00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,240
sub agencies right if you split together

00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:15,280
right so it's interesting about similar

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,370
experience if you

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,230
oh yeah and I think the partnering thing

00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:22,690
is real important too

00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:25,510
we didn't get it on the schedule this

00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:27,280
year yet but I'm gonna run up to the

00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,040
main room hopefully there'll be a slot

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,410
for a buff we've been doing a buff every

00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,030
year since Chicago I even here when I

00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,670
didn't show up in LA they still did it

00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:40,210
was called freelancer speed dating and

00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:42,520
we helped get in the room and we meet

00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:45,670
each other and I've met so many people

00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:48,100
I've had relationships like from that

00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,680
over the years even though you might not

00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,960
pull them into something for several

00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,940
years but you'll see them the neck I

00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,950
mean I think it's real important to have

00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,710
opportunities especially the next few

00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:02,080
days to have one-on-one conversations

00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:04,510
with each other that that for me this

00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,780
makes DrupalCon worthwhile if I can have

00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:09,610
some great conversations with

00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:15,730
individuals and get to know people more

00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:17,770
I like many years ago I saw it's it's

00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:21,070
funny how you get connections so many

00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:24,310
years ago there's a friend of my now

00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:28,690
friend of mine Val Val he's known as Val

00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:31,390
the ball on drupal.org and he tweeted

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,700
like oh like I've just been fired

00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:37,120
basically I've been fired for my job and

00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:39,250
I treats him well there's no reason to

00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,750
worry and you can find and we start a

00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,990
conversation I ended up working for us

00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:46,060
for several years and I work for ffw and

00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,460
through him I met other people around

00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:51,130
the world and we can take advantage of

00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:53,140
that global economy but the were there

00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,260
works with me is where I have individual

00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,060
relationships with people so we have a

00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,080
developer has been with us for five

00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:04,820
years he's in Israel

00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:06,950
and that relationship we didn't meet in

00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:08,300
person till last year in Baltimore and

00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,550
he had his whole family with him

00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,070
everything it was great so you know I

00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,870
think partnering is you know there's an

00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:17,480
art to it I think you got to spent some

00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,010
time nurturing those those relationships

00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,200
you never know

00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:25,490
there are certain things you you never

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,500
can tell by how a person looks whether

00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:31,610
they're going to be a good client a good

00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:33,680
employee you can't you can't make that

00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,870
judgment it's so important to keep an

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,060
open mind and keep those conversations

00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,190
going don't rush it you know it's like

00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,920
you're the sometimes you hear it looks

00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:44,860
like dating you know yeah you go out for

00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,090
coffee first you know but lunch

00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,350
non-committal

00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:50,060
and overtime you nurture those

00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,860
relationships you never know where they

00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,930
go well that's where being a small

00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,580
business that's why that's why I enjoyed

00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:58,640
so much it's about those those

00:50:55,580 --> 00:51:03,820
individual relationships not you know

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,820
it's very personal but thanks thanks

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,039
this is a conversation that has been

00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,680
very interesting to me over the past

00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,720
couple years the same reasons in New

00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,749
Orleans we had a bar for small Drupal

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,089
shops and so we're doing that buffing in

00:51:23,749 --> 00:51:28,519
tonight at five o'clock guys interested

00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:30,799
in discussing more unique pain points

00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:33,410
for smaller organizations but out of

00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:35,930
that we started a a slack channel small

00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,609
Drupal shop slack calm and so there's a

00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:40,670
couple of us small agencies and we've

00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:43,819
been able to do some of that where you

00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:45,559
know I had more work than we could do in

00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:46,910
another shop was looking for work and we

00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:50,140
were able to partner like he was talking

00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:52,579
about and kind of work together and

00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:55,640
solve a problem for us but provide work

00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:57,019
for them so if anybody's interested that

00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,529
you can jump on there and request an

00:51:57,019 --> 00:52:06,259
invite and we'll add you himself right

00:51:59,529 --> 00:52:09,980
small Drupal shop slack com yes I there

00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:14,089
was a there was a Drupal group on

00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:17,059
drupal.org called micro shop and I did

00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:19,099
get to admin access to that so maybe

00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:22,609
I'll attend the buff and maybe we can

00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:25,579
talk about strategizing you know

00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:28,160
communications like I've been thinking

00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:30,710
that the the small Drupal shop slack

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,779
channel needs to needs to be needs to be

00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:39,220
a channel within Drupal's channel that

00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:39,220
might be something that we consider

00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:49,800
all of it good point so yeah so like a

00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:51,660
good communication strategy making these

00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,180
connections and fostering them in

00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,130
between camps and and yeah that that's

00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,640
great

00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,640
one more

00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:05,829
like my experience with I have struggled

00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:09,220
with the same problems and so I trying

00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:11,829
to reach to a lot of startup communities

00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,930
to like sell more them into the Drupal

00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:17,040
since is more complex than WordPress for

00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:20,670
example or you can do more things so I'm

00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,569
trying to see if there is room for

00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,839
improvement there maybe you have

00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:27,579
experiences to meet some because I mean

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,700
it's not necessarily blog or e-commerce

00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:33,730
site but you know they have experience

00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:36,790
with startups to using do powerful yeah

00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:41,369
my experience startups have not been

00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:44,410
good clients for us their bootstrapping

00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:46,900
their they've got to be especially lean

00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:52,920
you can they are very accessible and

00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:55,900
even both more there's there's there's

00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:59,800
this organization called technically

00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:02,400
it's a dot ly and they hold these

00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:07,599
breakfast --is Tech breakfast --is

00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:09,520
around there around the US and they so

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,680
they do dog and pony shows you can go to

00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,200
and go there and network with startups

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,390
so it's a good place to find people but

00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:20,380
I think if the vet you have to be

00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:22,990
careful about vetting them they they're

00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:25,089
really tight on budget and they're they

00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:26,490
there tend to be technical people that

00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:29,020
are tough clients

00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:32,849
that's just my you know personal

00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:32,849
experience I hope you two better

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,390
Daniel I own a small agency and I have a

00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:44,490
question or what sighs we are team of

00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:47,430
thirty people we have an office in India

00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:49,440
as well that's very good thank you you

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:52,230
know the largest shop in Germany I was

00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,660
talking to a woman yesterday it's about

00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:58,350
30 people I think she's the largest shop

00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:02,760
in German so one of my experience has

00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:05,010
been that with Drupal when you inherit

00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,570
projects which are being done by some of

00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,390
the developers or some other agencies

00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:11,910
and you see that they have not followed

00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:13,290
the good practices and they blame it on

00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:16,200
technology because the business people

00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:18,090
have no understanding of what's the

00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,460
content types and blocks in paragraphs

00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:23,130
are and when you try to educate them and

00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,840
try to do the right thing for them in

00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:27,540
some sense it is kind of backfiring you

00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:30,270
and sometimes WordPress is so easy to

00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,550
make them I guess understand that just

00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,250
curious if you had any thoughts or if

00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:40,380
you want to share any comments on that

00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:43,800
we we've done a lot of salvage product

00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:46,440
projects you know come across our last

00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,540
big one we were the third vendor they

00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:53,430
went through two other vendors we're

00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:54,900
very frustrated I don't know the exact

00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:58,200
amount of money they spent but they

00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,940
probably spent you know but you know

00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,250
over a hundred thousand dollars already

00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:06,780
with two vendors over a two year period

00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:13,100
and had nothing to show for so it it's a

00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:16,860
it's I think it's a it's a good area to

00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:19,800
target but it's also it takes nuance

00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,830
right it takes you have to be really

00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:26,700
straightforward your documentation

00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:28,470
everything has to be far more detailed

00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,020
because you're already starting at a

00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,270
position of mistrust right

00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:36,210
and so you've got to go the extra mile

00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:39,600
to re-establish the trust even though

00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:45,270
you're not the person who who who

00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:46,710
started on the wrong track right so you

00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:48,240
got up your game which is not

00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:51,210
necessarily a bad thing you should

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:54,300
probably be upping you know looking at

00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:56,310
all those things to do better across the

00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,070
board for new clients and better

00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:01,560
communications better documentation

00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:06,690
managing client experience at client

00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:09,210
expectations but yeah that has been an

00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:13,910
area that we've we've worked in a quite

00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:17,700
a bit I do think it's a there there are

00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:20,190
unfortunately quite a few organizations

00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:24,240
out there then have had a bad experience

00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:26,369
with other vendors all right not it

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,100
I see Amanda's here so we're ready to

00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:32,810
switch change the guard five o'clock do

00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:38,130
you know which room the small Drupal

00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:39,030
baths one all right I'll be there thank

00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:45,479
you

00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:45,479
