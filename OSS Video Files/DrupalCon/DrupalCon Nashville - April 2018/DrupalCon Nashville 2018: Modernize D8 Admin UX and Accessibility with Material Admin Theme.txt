Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Modernize D8 Admin UX and Accessibility with Material Admin Theme
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	The good news: Drupal 8 architecture is a huge step forward in creating ambitious digital experiences - The adoption of Composer, Symfony, Twig, and OO PHP provide the building blocks for delivering modern sites and applications.

The bad news: The authoring experience, site management, siloed user flow patterns, multi-device (touch) support lack the tools that users expect, which in turn, has a negative weight on the project.

The good news (again!): These problems were the catalyst for creating a 'plug-and-play' new administration theme and support module. Material Admin & Material Admin Support

Google Material Design Langauge is one of the most widely adopted style guides for developing the web - Material Admin utilizes Google Material Design as a base for design, accessibility, and user interactions. The web adoption means that users will already be 'trained' in various interactions.

This session will highlight the patterns and features that Material Admin provides, how you can use it in any D8 project, How you can contribute, and the future for design and UX for D8 administration.

I'd actually say what the name of the

00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,990
session changed out there I was just I

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,899
don't think so either

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,899
yeah yeah right

00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:40,260

yeah so

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,480

00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,640
the one that's on the schedule the the

00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,890

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,970
session is different and again I won't

feel bad if you want to go catch

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,040
something else but I think you might

then yes sir so again this is maybe

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,940
different than what were you expected on

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,370
here the web accessibility for higher ed

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,350
session is not happening because the

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,380
speaker couldn't make it so I was I was

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,420
asked to fill in yesterday so again if

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,150
you want to go see something else please

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,150
please go do that I got no problem with

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,580
that this session is on d8 admin theme

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,290
and and some of the issues that revolve

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:27,400
around that and how we solve those

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:29,620
problems so yeah so given the short

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,660
timeline of finding about this yesterday

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,680
I did what I could to prepare for it and

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,480
part of this I would like to have you

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
know an open discussion about this I

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,459
think it is a it is a topic that affects

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,830
everybody honestly you know whether

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,920
you're whether you're developer site

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,510
builder your designer your you know the

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,180
actual person who is using the site

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,760
consuming it content authors you know I

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,570
think that one of the areas that Drupal

00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,239
has started to fall behind on is you

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,459
know how we how we author and how we do

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,580
things from the admin side and you know

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:09,100
what we're going to do about that I have

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,850
taken some steps but you know we'll see

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,850
what we'll go from there

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,769
so just to start out yeah my name is

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,500
brian wolde i I worked for Acquia and

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,200
the solutions architecture department

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,080
been doing Drupal for 11 years been to

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,110
nine nine drew pecans this is the third

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,210
session that I'll be speaking at some

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,000

looking for more people to help solve

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,360
this topic the bottom here I talked a

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,570
little bit about so my role at Acquia is

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,979
a bit unique inside what we do in the

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,770
solutions architecture you know in

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:54,040
pre-sales is that I run a small

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:57,220
engineering team that focuses on you

00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,360
know building out the kind of the art of

00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,090
the possible right

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,590
you know as we all

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,780
when you when you install Drupal you're

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,250
not seeing all that much right it's it's

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,139
it's looked at as a framework in that

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,700
way you've heard a lot of things that

00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,350
Greece is talking about to improve that

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,419
and I've been been working with him on a

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,889
number of those things and I've also

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,090
worked in a couple initiatives myself

00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,889
and our team's been working on some

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,250
initiatives to to solve those problems

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:20,600
as well and I think that you know I

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,160
think that there's a lot that a lot can

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,530
be done here there's a lot of area of

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,040
improvement um we are making a lot of

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,230
improvement this area right now but you

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,470
know given the role that I have I spend

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,750
a lot of time with prospective customers

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,310
whether they're you know never use

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,169
Drupal in their life never even heard of

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,419
it all the way down to we've been using

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,000
Drupal since 6 you know we're trying to

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,160
make improvements incremental stuff so

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,639
I've heard a lot of feedback one of

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,479
those things is is that we're behind

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,300
right what I've heard is that in a

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:59,180
compete situation where we are you know

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,090
working to try to convince somebody that

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,860
Drupal is the best solution for them

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,350
every single customer who decides not to

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,600
go with Drupal they bring up and they

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,490
cite that the UX experience was a major

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,070
factor for them choosing not choosing it

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,020
right happens all the time I know we all

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,450
hear that we all have our complaints

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,490
around that and so the other thing is

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,680
you know self-guided exploration as a

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,740
CMS you know when you go in and install

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,970
it it's it's not intuitive and and how

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,260
to do that it's not a true div and what

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,680
you need to do or how you go about

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,479
building that and that leads to

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,919
abandonment you know I think it's it's a

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,030
bit unfair right you know that's what

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,039
we're that's what we're trying to solve

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,780
is like well hold on a second you know

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,370
this may name what you're looking at at

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,810
first but there's a lot of reasons why

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,970
it's better and this is why we want to

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,470
prove that but we really do need to

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,970
solve that gap right we need to get

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,460
people excited about it again we want

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,770
people to be you know looking this is a

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,479
solution that can be good for them all

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,010
the way from the developers side of

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,110
things which were very very good at all

00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,820
the way through the authoring side of

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,080
thing which we're not great at right now

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,910
so that and then kind of ways into the

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,620
the technical benefits you know we can

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,479
talk about that all day long with in the

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,980
day if we're talking to people who are

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,080
going to be using the authoring tool

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,670
you know that can outweigh that because

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,980
they they have expectations because

00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,770
they've seen other things you know some

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,540
of the other CMS's and web content

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,330
management systems that we've competed

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,610
against all of those tend to do a lot

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,230
better of that out of the box right you

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,990
know we think about it sometimes as a

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,580
framework versus out-of-the-box CMS and

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,970
and that is true but I think that

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,020
there's definitely room to do both so I

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,030
think one of the things that I started

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,440
think about well you know what there's

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,450
actually a lot of kind of low-hanging

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,150
fruit here right I think that it's not

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,430
so much that the experience is bad it's

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,050
just you know they have expectations and

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,910
we haven't been we haven't been keeping

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,980
up with those and on top of that I think

00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,510
you know one of my opinion is and as

00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,130
I've seen this happening and as I've had

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,780
conversations with with people like

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,420
trees and and you know the community

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,640
members is you know authoring an admin

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,530
UX is going to be one of the most

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,360
important things to attracting new users

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,240
right you know they're starting to look

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,890
at like what can we do very quickly how

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,870
can we spin this up and so we can start

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,880
working today but then also build out

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,890
and expand this project into something

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,150
that's a lot bigger right and so we

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,580
really want to try to capture those

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,890
capture that piece and try to you know

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,540
tackle that in the right way that allows

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,940
people to still have the flexibility

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,380
that they have with Drupal but also

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,080
gives them a little bit more of an

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,820
opinionated workflow right that that

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,500
things are that are look like they all

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,390
work together we have this ecosystem

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,510
that's so amazing but the problem with

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,730
it is you know oftentimes the experience

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,500
of working with multiple modules

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,740
together I'm sure a lot of you have had

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,500
this problem they don't they don't all

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,610
act the same they all have different

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,740
actions they all have different ways of

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,810
doing things and you know maybe the end

00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,280
result is what you want but you know

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,220
trying to train somebody and all those

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,080
things can be can be a hard work and not

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,740
easy not easy for people to continuously

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,120
want to use it and and in the first

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,300
impressions matter like I said before

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,950
right like that market expectations that

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,380
where things are moving with all of

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,150
these you know kind of simplistic CMS

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,850
systems like the square spaces of the

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,190
world right they get expectations around

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,060
that and we say well you know there's a

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,820
lot of distance

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,170
edges to tools like that but you know at

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,210
the end of the day they want that

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,550
experience as well so we want to drive

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,810
towards that it's next one's pretty

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,510
interesting to me is that perceived

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,770
performance right one of the things that

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,330
I'll get to a little bit later here

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,900
after I talk about what I've heard from

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:45,180
from the theme I've been working on is

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,670
an outdated UI makes it feel slower

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,530
right you feel like you're this it

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,880
doesn't work as well you feel like it's

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,200
clunky you feel like there's going to be

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,140
pretty you're gonna run into problems

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,940
that's it's all perceived right it's

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,560
just they have expectations around what

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,080
the UI should look like how it should

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,490
interact they want it to be like like

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,260
Google they want it to be like whatever

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,330
tool that they're used to using on their

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,530
phones we don't have that experience

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,680
right now and that's something we're

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:13,410
trying to work towards any device you

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,790
know I don't think anyone would I would

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,430
venture to say there's not very many

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,290
people who use their phone to do any

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,990
type of tasks inside your book right

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,720
it's just not you just can't really do

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,420
it it's too hard they're not built to be

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,180
responsive out-of-the-box lots of of the

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,680
admin modules don't have any notion of

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,540
doing that but click points all that

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,920
stuff is just not there

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,720
but that's low-hanging fruit right

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,550
that's that's the good news there and

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,310
the consistency in simplicity I so I've

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,500
seen this earlier right with modules you

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,570
know there's no guidelines for how you

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,730
would go about doing your style guides

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,800
how you go about having interaction

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,330
patterns we have tools like the Uniform

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,700
API and things like that which help with

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,740
consistency but you can still build that

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,600
admin UI to look any way you want you

00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,340
can use anything you want which is great

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,380
the problem is when you start combining

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,230
different things together all the Sun

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,580
doesn't work very well anymore kind of

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,490
gets into that ramp up time too it's

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,560
like why does it take so long just to

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,320
set something up where I can put a piece

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,850
of media on the page and have it look

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
the way I want it to right those are

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,900
things that people expect to be able to

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,370
do day one and of course you can do that

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,020
and you can do that very well but it

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,400
takes a long time to get it set up so

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,010
that it's there and you have to do it

00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,870
every single project trying to try to

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,540
get away from that piece and having more

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,960
of that experience it is the direction

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,700
that we're trying to move here one thing

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,590
I've always said is that you know our

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,200
strength is also also

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,290
of our biggest weaknesses right the

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,390
ability to to build an architecture

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,710
exactly how you want to to to the

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,830
project requirements that you're doing

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:52,710
is is very easy and in really really

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,750
specific that it's a totally different

00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,030
than every other CMS out there that they

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,550
just simply can't do what we can do with

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,050
the velocity and speed they don't even

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,480
have the ability to even have those

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,460
conversations in many cases it's it's an

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,920
absolute strength than pupil that I've

00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,360
thought you know since since I started

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,150
Drupal you know ten or eleven years ago

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,610
but the problem with that is it doesn't

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,140
extend into the UX and the digital

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,460
experience it doesn't extend into that

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,950
you can't think that way

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,510
when you talk about UX doesn't work we

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,670
you know we try to think about being

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,440
open and allow you to do what you want

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,420
and that's great when you talk about

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,880
architecture not great when you talk

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,830
about UX and and more importantly a

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,720
shoot beyond it shouldn't be the

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,550
responsibility of the person making the

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,760
site or the person using the Speight to

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,050
fix those problems right that's there's

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,810
a making a sense there's a lot of repeat

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,550
work it's it's confusing

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,540
every project can be different of course

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,010
you want to put your own business

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,820
requirements into that when you need to

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,500
but the the 90% or 95% of that should

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,030
already be there and he can do that it's

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,410
just a matter of changing the way we

00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,440
think about it in the perspective of

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:01,020
that and I think that that's kind of a

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,870
really important area to think about

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,120
when we're thinking you know next

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,300
generation of Drupal next generation of

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,970
applications is do we want to have that

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,860
experience be you know connected do we

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,750
want the experience of contributed

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,240
modules to work in the same way do we

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:21,750
want you know the UI to be accessible

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,880
from your phone I mean that to me if we

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,710
don't that we're not going to have any

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,920
growth right that's going to be a huge

00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,900
piece of of keeping this project you

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,910
know having the passion behind it and

00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,710
the people behind it this say yes this

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,880
is what we want next generation this is

00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:42,390
where we want to spend our time building

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:44,100
projects so I sat down I said well what

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,230
can what can easily be done here right

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,730
you know there's a lot of things that

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,470
I've been talking about with this

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,880
perceived performance and that this

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,120
looks old so it probably

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,740
sucks kind of mentality there's a lot of

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,000
ways around that and it was very it was

00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,500
very frustrating to me because I would

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,540
try to explain that you know those

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,520
things are mostly just made up in your

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,500
mind right yeah sure you may not like

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,510
the way this looks within the dates it

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,110
is fast it is accessible it's easy to

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,580
use but you know that's not that's not

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,550
good enough anymore right we can't think

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,590
that way so I said well okay I can I can

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,660
pick off a few of these things really

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,790
really quickly right you know modern

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,130
theme style guide right what's having a

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,630
real actual style guide what are the

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,130
interaction patterns when you click a

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,200
button what are the interaction patterns

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:32,040
when you drag and drop something you

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,930
know how would you find content orders

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,550
that the filters go things like that

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,860
there's a lot of things that with just

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,260
some simplicity and making those always

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,540
consistent across the map would would

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,160
make that much easier which goes into

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,770
next in the decluttering right so

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,660
decluttering the interface there's you

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:52,530
know you've probably all built a note

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,720
type that has you know 54 form fields

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,490
and it's like absolutely insane to go

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,290
through and to actually create one the

00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,640
end result is amazing but that piece

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,350
where you're actually creating that it's

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,490
really really complicated and confusing

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:08,970
it takes a long time it's cluttered so

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,500
you know what about like so I started

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,390
think about okay so what about like the

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,560
little pieces in between and this is

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,960
something that we do when we're talking

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,280
about demonstrating Drupal is like well

00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,770
we have to build these kind of little

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,630
glue spots in between these modules and

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,610
glue spots in between themes and how we

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,850
interact with things that's actually

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,080
easier than I thought it was right

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,490
there's no process for that right now

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,640
which is the bigger problem which I'll

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,600
get to but I do think that that is

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:38,810
something that we can all be thinking

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,920
about to make it easier so I said well

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm gonna create an admin theme see what

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,000
happens right just let's just give this

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,470
a shot and I was and I was kind of

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,720
making a simple bet so I'm saying you're

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,450
sighs like I bet you that if I just make

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,830
an admin theme that utilizes the the

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,700
style guide that people are used to

00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,950
they're gonna think that it's a lot

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,480
better and a lot easier to use so I went

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,339
out and did that and I said well what's

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,350
gonna be the easiest you know easiest

00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,510
proof of Const

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,160
to get me in there and that was to take

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,190
that was take material design right I

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,550
think that everybody who has worked

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,080
inside and want anything in the web now

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,640
is they're familiar with Google's

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,050
products one way or another you know

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,610
they're gonna know how those interaction

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,410
patterns work they're just gonna see it

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,240
and it's gonna be intuitive for them so

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,100
I said well let me take that design

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,790
language and make a theme with it and

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,860
see what happens

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,620
and the idea was I'm not gonna change

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,060
any code really other than the you know

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,430
styling things differently

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,550
turns out I did a little bit but at the

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,860
end it was more about you know there's

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,080
there's small low-hanging things with

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,910
the designs that if we just made those

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,830
look and feel how we expect them to

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,330
we're going to get to a place that's

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,740
going to be a lot easier to use right

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,740
out of the box just with that change

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,900
nothing else at all and then the mobile

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,270
focus which I've already mentioned I

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,610
focused on doing that with where we're

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,230
able to actually create content from

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,570
your phone be able to create content

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,460
from touch devices you're able to click

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,990
buttons and without clicking five

00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,450
different buttons at once on your with

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,600
your finger you know that all that stuff

00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:14,300
makes it feel and work in a way that's

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,470
much faster simpler to use and familiar

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,400
with what you're used to with all your

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:21,530
other applications and so I call this

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,330
step one point five which was like okay

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,180
well yeah that wasn't as easy as I

00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:28,550
thought so turns out I need to make some

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,720
modules to do what I want to do you know

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,420
there's some limitations from a

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,170
technical standpoint around being able

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,670
to create well be able to do certain

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,830
things inside rip will require modules

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,590
there are already themes out there that

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,180
do this but at the end of the day you

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,680
know that's what you have to do so what

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,400
I did is they created the support module

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,230
that installs the next three modules and

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,650
and you'll see when I get into the demo

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,790
why I did that and what those things do

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,010
but really at the end of the day if you

00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,110
want material admin it's you go install

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,880
the theme if you want some of the extra

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,500
features you can install material admin

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,070
support and all that other stuff will

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,200
come with it

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,240
I should mention one of my goals with

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,680
this too was which is one of my pet

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,450
peeves sometimes with Drupal is that

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,400
there's never a time where I can just

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,980
turn on a module and it and it's just

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,630
kind of done you know I mean it happens

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,670
sometimes but

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,410
sometimes there's lots of configuration

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,670
you have to go into other modules and

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,890
configure them so that they work well

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,750
with it and I didn't want to do any of

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,880
that so I was I really wanted to focus

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,560
on okay you turn on this month this

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,090
theme you've got a new you've got a

00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,010
totally new look and feel you turn on

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,390
this module and adds in it's a couple

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,150
features automatically for you without

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,300
having to do anything and for the more

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,740
more or less that's that's what it does

00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,930
there's a couple of little caveats here

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,330
and there but I can talk about that one

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,830
when I get into the demo as well and

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,690
I've got a couple of use cases here as

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,660
well so if you've heard about the

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,700
distribution Contenta content of ships

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,640
out of the box with material admin as

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,490
its theme both front and back-end which

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,810
I wasn't anticipating but you know I

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,900
think that that's really gained some

00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,790
traction around you know why it's

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,280
important to have an administration

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:12,280
theme that works really well is when you

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,590
think about a decoupled solution like

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,180
Contenta is it's like well the only

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,760
thing that I'm using Drupal for at this

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,110
point is my add administration tasks

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,120
that's it that's all I do to the front

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,970
ends up you know some other angular

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,650
react whatever it may be so we got to

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,540
make sure that that's the best possible

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,340
because if not there's all these other

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,190
CMS's out there that are focusing on

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,200
doing just exactly that you know content

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,680
fools is one of those for example that's

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,660
API only CMS they focus on creating an

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,610
administration theme and in the

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,500
experience there and then what you do

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,200
whatever you want so if we're going to

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,640
do that we really need to focus on you

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,380
know what's most important for those

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,910
types of projects as we look forward and

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,490
what's important for the future of these

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,850
projects and demo framework which is the

00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:00,280
project that I own and showing off

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,280
various different you know how Drupal

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,270
can be more of an out of box experience

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,250
you can check it out there's an

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,040
open-source version of that I will admit

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,350
that that's been a bit neglected lately

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,090
but it does give you an idea of like

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,620
what you know what and out of box

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,170
appearance could be like for drupal and

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,520
this is kind of interesting in parallel

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,800
with word reefs is talking about in

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,570
keynote this morning around you know

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,130
UNAMI and all those other things that

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,860
come out of the box why we need that why

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,660
it's important so you know you can kind

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,970
of see what that is like maybe a first

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,640
direction of the

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,530
so maybe I'll just jump into well before

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,060
that is anyone have any specific

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,400
questions around you know I'm talking

00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:45,140
about is it make sense anything like

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,350
that go Bob will jump in to show you

00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,270
show you what I've been working on then

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,910
I guess before I go there these are kind

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,230
of the highlights where I feel like

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,200
areas that I tried to focus on right you

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,150
know forms Drupal's just series of forms

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,760
right at the end of the day from an

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,840
authoring experience standpoint so that

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,210
was important to me

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,980
navigation you know wayfinding knowing

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,320
where I'm at being able to say okay I

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,660
know exactly where I'm at right now

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,160
and and I know where to find other stuff

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,480
as well which is more importantly rather

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,740
than having to go oh I have to jump

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,050
around to these ten different places

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,760
just to get this field to work properly

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,400
right enter your reference field may be

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,890
a good example of that tooltips

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,660
moral cleaning things up responsive of

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,430
course action buttons that are clickable

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,140
from your phone action buttons that make

00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,960
sense in the same place in every single

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,400
page I can a graffiti is more modern and

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:41,660
what people are used to seeing and

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:46,210
expect things like that so anymore I'll

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,350
kind of jump into that so first of all

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,730
[Music]

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,530
yeah this starting on the appearance

00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,480
page right so some of the things I've

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,430
been trying to do is say well when it

00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,890
makes sense to use cards write that card

00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,450
model I'm going to I've started to do

00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,030
that in a few places like the theme page

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,320
you know making it easier to see you

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,990
know that we're again back to the

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,580
responsive piece of things things things

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,280
work a lot more how you would expect

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,960
them to as an application you know get

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,760
more information it's all there and easy

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,340
to see without being just a huge long

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,750
list of a bunch of stuff right another

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,000
example of that which I've been working

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,480
on is and the uninstall page right now

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,860
right now the card model as well trying

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,410
to clean up the way we think about

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,270
things and explain things to people who

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,740
have never used this before one thing I

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,890
always noticed was when I was building

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,720
this is I was so used to Drupal I just

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,970
knew the Drupal ways and

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,800
really that's not that's not the case

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,420
for a lot of people talk about expanding

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,880
into new markets and expanding and

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,470
growing Drupal and keeping you the

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,450
project that's so great that we all love

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,340
using you know we've got to think about

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,990
those types of things so making this

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,070
card model why can't I uninstall

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,720
something well it's not always obvious

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,550
when you when you're doing that inside

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,370
Drupal right now this is a small example

00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,540
but so I said okay well I'm not even

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,490
gonna have the ability to uninstall

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,080
something I'm gonna remove that entirely

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,350
if there's dependencies that are

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,540
conflicting so just making that kind of

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,030
an easier thing to read and understand

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,710
you know going into here and seeing what

00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,650
those what those requirements are for

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,450
that to be installed for example is is

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:21,230
kind of a the direction I was going with

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,870
this card model so kind of them a little

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,950
bit more than interesting stuff now

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:28,520
navigation again right so this kind of

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:31,450
navigation model words more familiar

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,670
with the tabs that we expect to see from

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,860
applications for actually having

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,470
breadcrumbs work turned out to be not

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,760
that not that easy of a task I didn't

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,310
realize that they just simply didn't

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,660
work in court so I had to write a lot of

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,570
glue code around that so that they

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,980
showed actually the page that you're on

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,230
so having the navigation at trickling

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,880
all the way down into you know way deep

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,150
into it and showing exactly what you'd

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,370
expect one of the more interesting areas

00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,930
is I try to focus on it was actually the

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,870
content management piece of things right

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,750
so if I go into admin conscient page for

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,820
example it's still a table but you'll

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,540
notice a couple of differences right all

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,420
the filters get moved into a down select

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,860
form here right showing you exactly

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,530
what's being filtered by so you know

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:21,380
exactly what it is that you're filtering

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,370
the bulk form piece is gone except you

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,510
don't because you don't need to look at

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,710
you don't need to see those types of

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,720
things until you've selected something

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,760
you don't you can't make a bulk action

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,050
unless something's been selected so you

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,690
know what I've done is made it so that

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,460
you know as I select things well now now

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,350
I can go ahead and make my bulk actions

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,660
over here right

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,770
you know simplifying things that this

00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,450
didn't do I didn't do anything

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,190
differently here I just moved things

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,560
around to be more modern and what people

00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:48,680
expect them to see and have them be

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,200
consistent across the board again this

00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,720
this one

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,929
down here so this kind of fob model was

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,120
another material design language piece

00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,350
here create new content so adding

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,120
content I should be all that content

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,190
from this page I shouldn't have to go

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,929
through four more clicks to add content

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,549
I should be able do it right here so

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:08,549
having this open up and showing all my

00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:09,960
content types here and so this is this

00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,720
is actually a material having support

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,669
that allows me to do this type of thing

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,139
and these icons come from one of the

00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:18,059
module is called type style which allows

00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:20,610
you to pick icons for all of your

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,440
content types for all of your workflow

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,779
transition States all of those things

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,630
that you would want to to use throughout

00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,909
your your administration theme that

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,260
would help people know what you're

00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:33,630
talking about without having to have a

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:38,610
bunch of different names and

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:40,440
nomenclature for them so big focus

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,970
around that was there and then creating

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,500
a you know an editing content right

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,139
going into the operations and editing

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,269
content didn't do a whole lot of much

00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:51,480
changing here around other than you know

00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:53,250
got just making the the vertical rhythm

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,139
and and those types of things more

00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,419
consistent to what you would expect you

00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:59,010
can you can do things again on mobile

00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,100
devices and be able to click things and

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:05,010
select them correctly things like date

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,019
and time picker I've implemented a day

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,570
and dime picker that's you know more

00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:10,620
what you would expect to be able to do

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,809
you should be able to just be able to

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,549
pull this open and and find the date you

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:16,740
want and select it rather than having to

00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:18,149
use that little like I don't know what

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,120
it is the HTML thing where you flip

00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:23,870
through it those types of things should

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,639
just be available out of the box right

00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,529
and then and then kind of going in from

00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:32,070
there is like okay well creating content

00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,970
is great but what about media what about

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,830
all of those things

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:38,010
what's interaction patterns for that how

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,049
do we hook into finding why is it hard

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,500
to find content right or find media to

00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:45,539
put on my content so you know with with

00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,570
the addition of some other modules like

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:51,029
entity browser we've we've made that an

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:56,010
easier thing to do I go to articles

00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:59,750
example of that I click into it I've got

00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,600
kind of a more modern architecture for

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,030
this loads

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,660
I don't know why my images are not

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:09,760
showing up

00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:11,200
you should be images here but wouldn't

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,100
be demo if it didn't break at least once

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,090
so you know same idea though you would

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,520
get the idea so if there are these

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,870
images here they're all broken but even

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,179
when they are broken you can tell that

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,710
it's easier to see exactly what what it

00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:25,929
is everything has the same height and

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,000
width you can you know scroll the window

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,679
and it should work more or less okay as

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,559
it expands down in there and you can

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,850
find all that stuff again same placement

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,650
for your filters they're all in the same

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,679
spot in every single time that a bulk

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,419
filter is applied things like that make

00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,679
it a lot easier for someone to just pick

00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:46,030
it up and start using Drupal also just

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,280
like small improvements that I would

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,740
expect it to be part of this is you know

00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,059
I shouldn't be able to scroll in the

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,679
background when this is open right

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:55,419
that's that's crazy why would I ever

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,820
want to scroll on the page behind this

00:27:55,419 --> 00:28:00,250
at the same time so like locking that

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,960
and having the ability to lock that be

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,030
able to click away and without having to

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,770
click X things just the really small

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:09,429
little interaction patterns that people

00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:10,690
expect to have we can put inside Drupal

00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:15,100
and have that available for people

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:19,360
without doing much work other areas that

00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:29,950
are kind of interesting I suppose going

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:33,490
into oh yeah so notifications for

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,780
example right notifications that show up

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,370
they just kind of put them wherever they

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,630
want right they don't they're just kind

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,820
of in the middle of your content it's

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,220
kind of confusing so what I did is like

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:45,220
well you know what I can do is put those

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,870
into more of a growl style or you know I

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,450
think they call it toast with with

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:51,940
material design so if I flush my cache

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,350
is you know I should just be able to see

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,080
a flash of that message rather than

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,400
having it be there and you know you can

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,970
see how this would come up in the corner

00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,380
here I don't have a you know a drawer

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,240
down here as well where I can go and

00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,049
find those notifications on that page if

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,250
if you needed to see them again and

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:11,500
there's a number of settings they come

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,580
along with this too so one idea I had

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,680
with is like well I don't want to make

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,270
it so that people you know Lou

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:21,640
some functionality or have problems with

00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:23,260
your trip in the in the admin appearance

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,640
page I've been trying to make it every

00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,030
single feature that I'm building

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,260
that's non-standard inside Drupal has

00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:34,810
has settings to has settings to actually

00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,550
turn those things on and off work or

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,300
change their things number of years and

00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:41,650
the date picker turn out and off the

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,130
table layouts for the cards you can go

00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:46,360
back to the standard tables for that

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,650
background scroll when the dialog is

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,480
open things like that you can turn all

00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,460
these things on and off right

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,750
allowing notifications just to go

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,850
straight to your drawer if they're too

00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,410
long so you don't get those massive

00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,270
errors that take up your entire page

00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,900
when when they when they pop up peach

00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,400
beers or something along those lines

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,560
that's added some compatibility mode as

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,720
well so there are conflicts with the way

00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,100
that I do select dropdowns and things

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,720
like that because it requires full

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,840
replacements of those selects since I

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,360
can't style those so allowing people to

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,910
go back to the old style in case they're

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,200
using something like select two or one

00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,370
of those other features that they are

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,640
they're module that they would like to

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,840
use as well so trying to be accessible

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,950
in that way it's what I've tried to get

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:36,430
out with that then see my notes here of

00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:39,940
other areas that action buttons so yeah

00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,530
as you saw like the content page here

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,140
you know all the operations get into

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,120
this these drop-down ability here so you

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,020
know exactly what you're looking for

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:53,350
same image same with drag-and-drop right

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,360
all the drag and drop features have have

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:57,850
the same styling that you would expect

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:03,040
from like the hamburger drop and pull

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:07,030
down with that as well the other areas

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,260
that I was going to show off and maybe

00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,910
this is something that I kind of

00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,710
originally planted you on my mobile

00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,120
phone right but I couldn't get

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,860
everything all working in the short

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,090
period of time but just you know just

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,850
being able to see what it's really like

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:21,130
to have you know it on a mobile phone

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,230
and having these big click points so I

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,179
can go to any page I want to you know

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,429
having responsive breadcrumbs that

00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:30,219
still see what it is without dropping to

00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:32,950
multiple lines you know navigating the

00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:35,919
site is very easy in this having having

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,479
actions that respond once you click them

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,059
right so there's kind of that animation

00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:42,249
there that happens you can see how those

00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:49,479
notifications move down here when you're

00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:50,739
on mobile as well so you know I've tried

00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:51,789
to give you a quick idea of this there's

00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:54,309
a couple of other things that I was

00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,440
going to talk about that are enhance

00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,440
this experience right so when I was

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,729
talking about Contenta for example well

00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,309
think about that as more of a portal

00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:04,749
style more of a portal than anything at

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:05,769
that point you know you don't have a CMS

00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:07,690
where you're going and you're seeing the

00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:09,839
site live and you go around and create

00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,099
content and things like that so you know

00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:16,479
small little things like similar to

00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:18,849
WordPress that when I'm logged out you

00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:20,289
know if I go to the user the user page

00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:22,690
there right so you kind of have this

00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:25,210
feel of more important where you're able

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,039
to log in again has that responsive feel

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,779
to it so it's easier to use from a

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,369
mobile device

00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,039
you know solving some of those simple

00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:36,489
problems that make it kind of a pain and

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,409
feel like an old an old CMS doesn't need

00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:45,179
to feel that way for for something so

00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:45,179
simple that's not my password

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,570
this point well I'm getting backlogged

00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:56,410
in does anyone have kind of questions

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:59,310
comments wondering what's out there does

00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,310
this make sense to people

00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:20,740
huh yeah yeah I have what what

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:27,700
specifically were you were you thinking

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:29,560
about with that yeah so yeah totally so

00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,840
for labels and stuff I have done a fair

00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,100
bit with that and and also what I was

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,390
getting it with the description so every

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,610
all the descriptions are now inside

00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:38,320
tooltips right so it just takes up there

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,360
removes that space and in fact actually

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,070
I would like to move that into maybe

00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,870
where the labels are ads it's maybe the

00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,180
next step with that to even give it more

00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,830
some more vertical rather than there so

00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,660
all of those the the areas where you

00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,180
would see just like almost a wall of

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,070
content because every single field as a

00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,310
description you don't need to see that

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,440
95% of the time so when you do you can

00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,910
just roll up scroll over it you know you

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,980
can still select inside there you can

00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:06,460
click things if there are links in there

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,530
it's accessible that way oh one thing

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,660
that would be would fall into that as

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:13,120
well as if i hopes recent yeah this word

00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,820
so for example if it's a multi-select

00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,400
field right you know making that really

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,230
easy to select those items using a click

00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,960
box which you can again use your phone

00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:25,270
to do and if i filter from that now

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,830
again I'm showing the what it is

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,520
filtering by right here inside this

00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,990
little pill so giving you visual

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,730
representation of what's happening

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,800
without having to weed through a bunch

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,440
of form fields was the other piece of

00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,300
that so kind of that bubble up model

00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,310
where it shows right this is what's

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,410
going on on this page I can make that

00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,940
change by resetting it or whatever I

00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:48,760
want to do and be back to where I was

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:52,330
before that so all of the all of the

00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,520
form fields I replace with but what is

00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,930
part of the spec for material design

00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,290
language and I think there's only a few

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,630
that

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,400
that I run into that have you know some

00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,350
minor issues and I think I've resolved

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,270
most of those at this point drop downs

00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,280
were we're kind of the biggest pain

00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,020
point for that since it completely

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,290
replaces the slack filled with list

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,810
items so has to in the case where drop

00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,310
drupal's looking for you know specific

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,960
markup which it should never be doing

00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,410
I've made a lot of cork tickets around

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,670
that it does though and so it breaks

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:29,560
things when it's looking for a specific

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:33,730
markup structure from a developer

00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:35,440
standpoint you know I I'm still in the

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,290
early phases of figuring out how I can

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,230
do this but I have moved everything to a

00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:43,300
modern architecture using golf for my

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,610
task management SAS for managing

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,550
variables all of that stuff I have like

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,930
a color scheme guide built in that very

00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,930
easy to change all of these colors

00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,120
simply ability to move things around

00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:57,430
like you know maybe you want the the

00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,900
breadcrumbs not to be there this is a

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,580
little bit of an undocumented feature

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,110
right now but if I go to I have a sub

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,030
theme of this actually for our

00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,620
distribution but in the case here I

00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:11,200
could take my breadcrumbs and move them

00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,390
you know above the site branding save

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,120
the black and now you know we have this

00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,830
other style that allows these these

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,600
breadcrumbs to kind of be hidden a

00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,550
little bit and have this you know shadow

00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,190
show a little bit more and reduce some

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,140
of that vertical space so another

00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:32,320
another Google style that I implied is

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:34,480
allows you to do that so I can get back

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,290
to this again but what I wanted to talk

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,900
about now is you know I did get some

00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:43,000
feedback right so there's its head like

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,070
7,000 downloads and I don't remember how

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,600
many active sites are using it changes a

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,960
fair bit and I don't know I don't really

00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,310
trust that system anyway but you know

00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,650
some of the feedback I have gotten was

00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,880
that you know the mobile usability like

00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,850
wow I actually couldn't do some of these

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,650
minor tasks on my phone now nine out of

00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,540
ten people that that have report any

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,730
feedback has said that exact thing right

00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,800
the perceived performance again which I

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,660
thought was very funny we've had a lot

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,640
of prospective customers who've never

00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,830
seen Drupal and they're like wow this is

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,910
really fast this is you know what did

00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,560
you guys do to make

00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,300
so much faster I'm sorry people who have

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,220
used Tribble before like why is it so

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,450
much faster it's actually exactly the

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,940
same if I change the theme it would be

00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,580
exactly the same as seven so nothing's

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,870
changed at all not a single thing and

00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,100
it's not that it's probably actually

00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:31,140
slower because a lot of JavaScript

00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:33,070
running so you know ease of use right

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,310
expectations if we're buttons are going

00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,890
to be expectations of how labels and

00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:40,690
rollovers work all of those things that

00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:43,150
often times in core right now you know

00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,950
work one way work another way depending

00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:47,620
on where you're at and the who developed

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:49,120
it and what theme it is so you know it's

00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,940
simplifying that and making it a single

00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,380
piece I'm way finding which I also found

00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,180
really interesting I haven't changed any

00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,430
of the structure of any of the pages and

00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,380
how you access them but most of the

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,730
people who report any feedbacks like wow

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,610
it's brought quicker for me to get to

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:05,170
different pages I don't know why it's

00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,300
actually one more click oftentimes

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,550
because it doesn't have that weird drop

00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,310
button thing that I think is the worst

00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:14,650
user experience of all time having a

00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:17,680
button next to drop-down that you can

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:20,890
click I don't know it's weird so I got

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,330
rid of that so you know that kind of

00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,860
stuff was the feedback I've been getting

00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,080
and if I had more time to do this

00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,330
presentation I didn't again I didn't

00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,330
know about it until yesterday my goal

00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:33,280
was to be able to you know actually do

00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,560
some some user testing right you know

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,210
have people sit down and say you know go

00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,490
complete this task and my goal with that

00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:42,010
was not only to do that with Drupal that

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:44,590
that exam exact same task inside

00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,180
WordPress exact same task inside you

00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,940
know site court any of these other CMS's

00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:51,310
out there and then have them do the

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,860
exact same tasks in seven say well you

00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,870
know could you do it could you not do it

00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,580
you know so on so I have a pretty good

00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,580
feeling on what that result is going to

00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,800
be but you know I haven't gotten to do

00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,830
that stuff yet so that's kind of the

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,240
next phase of things speaking of the

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,090
next phase of things

00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,190
step two so now that I feel like you

00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,710
know I'm in an alpha stage not getting a

00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:16,300
lot of bug reports at this point aside

00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,000
for some contribs which I haven't

00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,130
figured out what to do with yet you know

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,350
how do we how do we make this a reality

00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,839
inside Drupal core so we can do a lot

00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:28,040
more with it right you

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,589
first problem was fixing some of the

00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,900
markup right there's a lot of markup

00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:35,900
weirdness inside Drupal that's just old

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,700
right you know input submit that's you

00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,320
you don't nobody does that anymore right

00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,050
that's not a modern architecture for

00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,310
html5 moving all that to buttons so that

00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,280
you can actually style them would be

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:49,130
really nice old JavaScript practices I

00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,460
was mentioning earlier where core hides

00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,980
buttons that when you click a link or

00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:58,550
click a checkbox it then goes and finds

00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,750
that element and clicks it getting rid

00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,690
of that kind of stuff so that we don't

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,830
have to rely on the mark-up architecture

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,089
and still be able to do the same

00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:09,080
function functions that we're doing

00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:11,630
today oh yeah this one there's been a

00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,780
long long task for a long time which is

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:16,430
the Drupal themes lack the ability to to

00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,950
have module dependencies right

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,839
I think adaptive theme was the first to

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,080
kind of push this piece here because

00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:25,520
they require a module to use the theme

00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,800
it's like well why can't we why can't we

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,290
declare those dependencies with modules

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,910
so that I can have some consistency and

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,670
force some of the things that I can't do

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,960
in the theme by forcing a module to be

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,109
installed with it and everything works

00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,150
you know out of the box so you lose a

00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:43,040
couple of pieces around that which is my

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,440
next goal I've got a lot of you know

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,240
core core issues out there that

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,460
hopefully we'll get into some of the

00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,830
next point releases in 8 which will

00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,270
allow us to you know get closer to

00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:57,280
moving this type of thing into into core

00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,780
not thinking that we would move like

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,580
material design stuff in there you know

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,859
again that was that was an experiment

00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,119
for I was you know it was the easiest

00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:06,740
thing for me to get a hold of his

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,510
easiest thing for me to know that you

00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,760
know I know people use Google I know how

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,470
that they'll have that familiarity so

00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,890
it's more of the experiment around that

00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:18,160
but the concept of having this modern

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:22,790
architecture is what I was trying to

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,070
prove and so the next piece is like well

00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,930
you know what what can we do to solve

00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:30,020
this it's like we've gone through a lot

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,790
of technical some technical pieces here

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,920
it's like maybe maybe there's some way

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:36,920
that we can package styling into and

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,490
p.m. modules that allow you know modules

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,560
to you

00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,720
the styling inside there their admin

00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,330
theme so they don't I don't have to you

00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,250
know accommodate for that for example so

00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,600
things like that I don't know what that

00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,450
would look like I haven't really gotten

00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:54,050
that far yet but you know as I get into

00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:56,150
to looking at the the differences and in

00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:59,210
ways that we can start to handle having

00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:02,090
an ecosystem for a style guide and for

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,580
user experience you know we'll start to

00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,260
explore how we make that more robust and

00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,020
allow people to tap into those things

00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:12,320
that our module developers or or theme

00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,910
developers whatever it may be so you

00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,860
know that's kind of my road map with

00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,119
that you know again just kind of a side

00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,190
probably turned out is just a side

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,630
project that I had that you know there

00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,250
was a big need you know a lot of people

00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,350
started coming to me that I hope I had

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,150
done no promoting of this at all they

00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,200
just found it randomly and people start

00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,150
to you know kind of grew organically

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,770
that way which gives me a really good

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,260
indication that people are really

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,240
seeking having something more more

00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,130
modern something different than what

00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,130
they haven't you know coming with core

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,950
yeah so at that point that was that was

00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,369
a that was all that I had for my

00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,369
presentation

00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:59,300
yeah again like in terms of installing

00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:01,580
all this stuff I do have this slide I

00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:06,710
can put these slides up for people but

00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:08,690
it's really easy to that one mm yeah

00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,220
material admin and then there's some of

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,630
the additional modules in this slide as

00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,240
well where you can go and download those

00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,350
and again everything just kind of should

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:22,990
just work

00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:22,990
oh sorry I always forget that yeah okay

00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:29,380
hey so you touched on this a bit but in

00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,430
Drupal 7 if you tried to install a

00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,780
alternative admin theme on your site

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,240
though the whole thing would break

00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,620
because yeah like the modules custom

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,440
usually custom modules requiring

00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:43,130
specific HTML and is there anything

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,990
about Drupal 8 that makes that less of

00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,580
an issue like just with the way that the

00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:51,320
theme system is set up or well my whole

00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:54,100
site still be unusable I most of your

00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,230
site so there is still the issue of

00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,540
controls that have complex UI's like web

00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,920
forms is a good example of that right

00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,190
they kind of do their own thing with

00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,890
that my solution right now has been to -

00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:09,560
I have been supporting those controls

00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,120
inside my theme by by you know any of

00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,130
the things that are specific to that

00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,950
that are not standard through you know

00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,950
form API and how it outputs the HTML and

00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:21,350
stuff i've been i've been manually

00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:23,780
fixing those inside the theme for for a

00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:26,060
lot of the bigger modules but in general

00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,280
most modules that i've turned on just

00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,720
work there hasn't been any admin UI

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,600
stuff so long as they're not writing

00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,060
their own specific Twigg stuff that

00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,890
which sometimes happens more or less

00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,070
they they just work because of I'm

00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,480
expecting what that what those as forms

00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,890
most of the times so I know what those

00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,010
forms you're going to be so long as

00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,390
you're using the form API so I haven't

00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:50,270
run into any other than the ones I have

00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:52,190
fixed yet that had been problems select

00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,450
- was it was it was an example of one

00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,770
like well actually now I have to have a

00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,960
compatibility mode because I can't

00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,880
replace these select box they can't we

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,980
can't both be replacing select boxes so

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,480
I was like well I'll accommodate for

00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,970
that and turn that off as a feature in

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,069
the theme so that's the area that that

00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,749
piece specifically is

00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:10,670
is what I'm getting at with you know

00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:13,130
phase three is like how do we go about

00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,079
making this easier and more accessible

00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,690
and following the same style and

00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:20,390
patterns I haven't figured out that

00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:21,949
solution yet this was just phase one say

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,949
look we can get pretty far with only

00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:27,160
doing themes you know what's next I try

00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:30,680
to figure that out and then have you

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:33,319
also compared like the accessibility of

00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:37,759
this approach to what just what's out of

00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:40,759
the box in in court so as far as I can

00:45:37,759 --> 00:45:42,319
tell the accessibility is pretty much

00:45:40,759 --> 00:45:45,019
exactly that well actually even maybe

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,209
slightly better because the way that

00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:49,400
I've set up tabindex is our way that the

00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:52,549
material I CSS set up standing next is

00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,609
for select boxes and stuff oh goody one

00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:59,329
place I didn't go which is a cool spot I

00:45:55,609 --> 00:46:03,079
think is views right so I didn't do a

00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:04,969
whole lot with views other than style it

00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:08,809
but it does it just you know it's the

00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:11,509
small little things that will allow you

00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:13,579
to work a lot better inside of this you

00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:15,140
know I'm opening this up and having that

00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:17,269
but you can see how what I was getting

00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,670
at it automatically selects the first

00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:21,890
box you know I could tap through

00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,509
everything exactly how you'd expect you

00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:26,569
know everything I can do it's just my

00:46:23,509 --> 00:46:28,180
keyboard so using escape things like

00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:31,519
that which actually don't work in court

00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,869
work here so I would say actually I

00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,999
would venture to guess it's slightly

00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:37,779
better in terms of accessibility awesome

00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:37,779
thanks yeah

00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:42,980
we'll have to talk forms later is on the

00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,720
web for module maintainer oh yeah I was

00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,700
not coming to ask a question about that

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,080
yeah um what I am seeing is we're

00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,060
running into in the community similar

00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,710
design small design patterns that we

00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,930
need to get into core like the tooltips

00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,280
one is a big one like I had to go and

00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,260
implement something because things got

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,540
too complex and the card layout is a

00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,500
huge like I need the card layout for

00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,050
something information that I'm

00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,400
maintaining yeah um but my questions

00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:06,800
more about in the getting off the island

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,560
concept like you've done a proof of

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,540
concept using material Adam I personally

00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,670
see it as completely successful mm-hmm

00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,290
and it brings up the question why should

00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,550
we build our own admin theme shouldn't

00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,690
we use something that's out there in the

00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,850
community it's you know like the

00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:21,170
material admin is working really well

00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,450
mm-hmm

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,250
I guess what's the level what's the

00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:27,140
level of effort that you had to put in

00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:30,860
to use the material admin is it a viable

00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,990
concept to kind of just use it I mean it

00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:36,110
core can also also offer to admin themes

00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,190
it could offer the light core admin

00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,720
theme where then people could use that

00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,310
as a starting point but this has a much

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,070
better out-of-the-box experience yeah

00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:44,510
yeah what has the community that's you

00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,400
know when we start evaluating these like

00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,930
we when we talked about react first few

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,570
yeah the question is how's this

00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:53,000
community working with is it only Google

00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,770
supporting it right right or there's now

00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,350
a community yeah I think I think that's

00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:01,730
interesting I think that my perspective

00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:03,440
around that is that I've run into a

00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,730
couple of technical blockers that I

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,340
don't think you'll ever be able to do

00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,410
and can't rib and I think that we can

00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,780
solve those problems in core and so you

00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:13,940
know it could be something where it's

00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,620
like oh we take this and move this as an

00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,600
option inside core but there would still

00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:19,460
need to be some work that goes to the

00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,410
system inside core to allow us to do

00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,960
more with that you know it's getting

00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,560
that technical blocker stuff around

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,830
dependencies and things along those

00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,200
lines so I'm not I'm not exactly sure

00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,160
but you know I think it's more I would

00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,510
be curious to know what people's

00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,610
opinions are and you know there's a lot

00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,050
of people who don't like you know they

00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:37,520
don't like Google design right and

00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,780
that's that's fine right you know

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,460
there's always opinions around that

00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,440
stuff and again I picked it just because

00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,170
it was so widely accepted and so widely

00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,240
used maybe we need something more Drupal

00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,400
specific I don't know but I think the

00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,320
concepts around form stuff around the

00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,990
tooltips another thing I know you did

00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,110
with

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:57,240
messages the inline messages that kind

00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,860
of pattern needs to get into into core

00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:08,640
as well

00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:11,220
yeah other questions similar and that

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,320
line so it looks much better than the

00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:17,130
theme right that it's currently out

00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,750
there are you gonna be working on this

00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:21,210
continuously like they're gonna die like

00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,530
if we start using it I hope you like

00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,830
what's gonna happen with this thing you

00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:27,990
know I don't I think you know one one

00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:33,930
nice thing about this being out there

00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:36,420
and contributed some some patches things

00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,710
like that they're also module

00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,900
maintainers have come to me say hey I

00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:42,150
want to support some of the stuff you do

00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,800
and the theme in my in my in my module

00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,590
you know what do I need to do to make

00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,780
that work better so I think you know

00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:50,030
we're gaining traction I'm mostly the

00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,710
only one working on it right now but

00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:54,420
I've had another guy that worked with me

00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,640
a taqueria we spent spends Matmos as

00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:00,480
well so I would say that you know as it

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,830
grows my goal is that this will

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,140
definitely be around until something

00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,670
gets solved inside court right or

00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,470
something along those lines and I would

00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,910
I would rather eventually not be hold

00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,680
doing this and it would just be a core

00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,140
thing that you know the community police

00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,090
backs and supports but until then you

00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,510
know Mike my goal is to continue to

00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,510
support it

00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:26,300
I have a quick question for you it looks

00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:29,790
like you've done some preliminary work

00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:33,650
with this module and that that work is

00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:35,970
changing core around do you see other

00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:39,120
design patterns that could come in and

00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:41,700
create a similar theme and piggyback on

00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,760
the work you've done and then sort of

00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,650
open up this ecosystem where this sphere

00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,680
or where we can start thinking about

00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:52,440
different patterns and you know mm-hmm

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,510
maybe incorporating not just material

00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,130
design but other other patterns and

00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:59,040
could be part of this that could be like

00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,720
the Drupal material design yeah I mean

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,220
that's that's my goal is to try to get

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,830
us to think more around you know

00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:07,590
building a real style guide in and what

00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:09,330
I think of a style guide is really what

00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:11,160
are the interaction patterns that we

00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:13,620
have right what is an action button do

00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,150
what is it drag-and-drop do what is you

00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,620
know when I click and open up a modal

00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:18,390
how does that interact is it fullscreen

00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,850
what you know all those types of like

00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:23,460
small details that are usually inside

00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:25,380
design specs right there isn't any of

00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,240
that right now and I think that trying

00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,620
to have that's a starting point isn't we

00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,800
can weaken the define those patterns

00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,120
clean up the output of the HTML and then

00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,330
all sudden we start to look at like well

00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,980
now we can start to build other themes

00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:40,350
that are similar to this that use those

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,790
guidelines and maybe just look like

00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,070
bootstrap or look like something else

00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,870
that you like better

00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:47,700
that that is totally an option and very

00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:50,430
viable and some of the patterns I've

00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,350
introduced here you know probably not

00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:54,810
technically the best implementation

00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:57,600
because I'm limited to inside theme for

00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:00,300
example but what it does do is it proves

00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,680
that these patterns are really important

00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,790
and we need to think about those because

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,270
I don't think there's a whole lot of

00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:07,320
that going on right now but what one

00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:10,440
other thing that I was going to point

00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,510
out that I forgot about was that you

00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,970
know on the front end - there's other

00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:17,100
there's also concerns like so something

00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:19,850
that I've always disliked about about

00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:24,780
Drupal since the beginning of time is

00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:26,610
basically how it just played when you're

00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,200
an admin it just places like your

00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,930
primary links and all that stuff just

00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,950
you know arbitrarily on the page right

00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:36,500
so one of the things that we built was

00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:38,750
using outside ends that the sidebar is

00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,579
one called moderation toolbar which is

00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,650
one of the modules I had up there is it

00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:44,210
puts all that stuff right in the air for

00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:46,160
you so it's easier to see it you know

00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:48,740
it's more what you would expect from

00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,010
from an application so this tells me if

00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:54,380
my mod my article is published in this

00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:57,200
case gives my information over here I

00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,359
can add icons using the type Styles

00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,130
module that we have installed here

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,560
change the color of those buttons things

00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:05,329
like that all on the box and just kind

00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,099
of putting all that stuff off to the

00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:09,440
side so it's not ruining the design when

00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:11,349
you're logged in things like those kind

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,450
of patterns I feel like are ones that

00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:20,150
would make sense to have as kind of a

00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:26,300
guide for doing these things it's called

00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:27,710
the moderation sidebar yeah and that

00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,390
one's standalone you don't need to use

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,460
material admin for that or anything like

00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:34,070
that you can go and do that and it will

00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:41,119
just put your primary and secondary tabs

00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:44,079
over into that hi has any anticipation

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,069
been you know developed so far around

00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,780
extending this to the front end you know

00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:49,609
a lot of these types of controls may be

00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,260
made available to site users who are not

00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:53,270
using the admin interface as well I'm

00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,220
thinking like you know an order form or

00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:57,829
a registration form and that type of

00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,900
thing a little bit of that with the that

00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:02,599
was one of the the objectives of having

00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:05,060
to use this material admin support

00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:08,359
module is that you know you have to you

00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,770
have to use a module to access CSS and

00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:11,450
JavaScript on both front and back end

00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,800
because you know either your front-end

00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,690
theme or your back-end theme is going to

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,970
control that otherwise so putting that

00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:20,420
stuff inside your module will allow us

00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:21,950
to do that so you know an example of

00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,440
that is this the sidebar right so

00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:26,720
extending that I haven't built a theme

00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,950
for the sidebar yet that's on my to-do

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,089
list this this sidebar and trying to

00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,640
figure out what you do with nav bar

00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:37,520
whether it's something else or just

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,710
theming this those are two areas I

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,060
haven't gotten to yet that are like your

00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,730
front-end administration that you want

00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,130
to feel like that it's cohesive from the

00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,140
back

00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,760
theme as well because you know you're

00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,870
you're an up here an admin you're an

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,250
admin whether you're on the back or

00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,740
front end of your site so they should

00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,660
all look and feel exactly the same and

00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:59,430
that's that's a focus of probably like

00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:01,140
you know my next phase of things so I'm

00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:04,890
not sure about like using those patterns

00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:06,300
as part of what your site's going to be

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:10,590
or your applications going to be I'm not

00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,480
sure that makes sense I don't know but I

00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,090
guess there are libraries you know in

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,030
core like just the typical jQuery UI

00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,890
ones there's some expectations around

00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,360
you know i I've redeemed all that in the

00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,980
backend well now what happens on the

00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,460
front end just looks like the old one

00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,930
right so trying to figure out ways to

00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,820
consolidate those to allow us to have

00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,860
you know cohesive front and back-end

00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,800
experience and patterns they're the same

00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:39,810
it's definitely something I'm looking at

00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:41,910
trying to figure out one thing I did do

00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:45,990
with that though is you know for example

00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:49,140
if you're using panels I can go in here

00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:51,450
and again my my images are probably

00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:54,780
still broken oh they kind of work here

00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:56,400
but you can see that the jQuery UI looks

00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,620
different but all of these items that

00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,290
are inside here that I can select the

00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:03,120
different you know images are all that

00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:05,400
using the material admin styles so

00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,770
that's done through that support module

00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,360
that just comes out of the box too so it

00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:14,030
would do things like you know putting

00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,030
this this over here and and so on

00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:27,740
any other questions yeah I think there's

00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:29,270
a source isn't there some method for

00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,370
that that they have where we all put

00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,850
them somewhere I'll figure that out but

00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,160
I don't know

00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,900
I remember the past they told me to put

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,430
them somewhere and I haven't heard that

00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:42,410
this year yet so I'll make them

00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:44,030
available one way or another yeah I just

00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:50,660
finished them like 20 minutes before the

00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:52,160
presentations anything else well I hope

00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,020
you guys you know go out and give it a

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,850
try give me your feedback please you

00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,920
know create issues if we run into issues

00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,720
with modules or anything like that or if

00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,600
you have ideas around what what could be

00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,430
next I'm definitely open to to anyone's

00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:12,750
ideas around that

00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:12,750
