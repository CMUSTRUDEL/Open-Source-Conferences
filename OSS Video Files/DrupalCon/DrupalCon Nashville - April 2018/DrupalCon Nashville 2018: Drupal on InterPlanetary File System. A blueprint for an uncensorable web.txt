Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Drupal on InterPlanetary File System. A blueprint for an uncensorable web
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	“There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.” – Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

What led to this session?

A team has published a snapshot of tr.wikipedia.org, the Turkish version of Wikipedia on IPFS.

Why did that happen? Wikipedia went dark for everyone in Turkey. According to the independent watchdog group Turkey Blocks, the Turkish government had issued a court order that permanently restricts access to the online encyclopedia.

Why should the web move to IPFS?

Short answer, improving humanity’s access to information without the need of governmental agencies controlling that information.

How does IPFS works?

This section of session discusses how IPFS changes the addressing of information, moving from location addressing to content addressing.

IPFS is harder to attack and easier to distribute because it’s peer-to-peer and decentralized.



The session will also discuss the various aspects of IPFS like,

1. The content downloaded is cryptographically verified

2. If one IPFS gateway gets blocked, you can use another one.



and more.

So where does the challenge lie?

When there is content, our beloved Drupal needs to be part of it and deliver same editorial experience we enjoy, yet utilising the immutable nature of content on IPFS.

What is the Blueprint we are talking about?



We created a blueprint and the development is in progress. It needs more attention and more love from our Drupal community to make it a feasible and useful CMS to easily harness the power of IPFS in specific use cases.


The key idea of session will be brainstorming and collaboration on ideas to how to make it robust to make it top choice CMS for such use cases.

PS: Can we invite Julian Assange for this? He might just love it

hi guys oh welcome to our session I hope

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,200
you guys are having a good time metric

00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,869
will gone let's tell about a couple of

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,450
days left so make the most of it

00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,830
okay so I'll jumping right in I'm gonna

00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,650
quickly introduce ourselves

00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,439
I am they want you I had businesses open

00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:38,380
sense labs you guys can call me deaf but

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:40,300
I am NOT deaf I am bass Eastern so a few

00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,660
of you laughed but I had this like just

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:47,140
to like a bow me so just to give you off

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,840
to wait again and now I had architecture

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,050
at open sense labs and so one of our key

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,240
focus area is to bring technology which

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,420
has outside the periphery of PHP and

00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,850
Drupal and use that to build make better

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,460
digital experiences so that's where NLP

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:09,040
and that's where where ipfs was

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:14,560
something we picked up right someone who

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,720
can take a picture be raised on me okay

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,479
so the agenda of the session will be

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,740
very simple will first understand what

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,810
are the current problems of the internet

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,729
were they were dealing with okay what is

00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,009
the common thread connecting those

00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,799
problems possibly put a solution out

00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:32,710
there why ipfs and then connect Drupal

00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:36,249
and ipfs and let's think about that so

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,780
just to be clear the agenda of this

00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:40,090
session is to bring the community

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,700
together to be more accepting to

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,659
technologies that are outside Drupal as

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,280
well okay okay so starting over the code

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,749
there's more than one way to walk burn a

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,130
book and the world is full of people

00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:52,119
running about with it matches so that

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,939
was said by rad

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,590
Gregory or author of Fahrenheit 451 so

00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:58,659
he he meant it in a more literal and

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,850
metamorphic all sense that people there

00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,819
will always be people who are deterrent

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,130
to accepting new technologies but we as

00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,899
an open-source community should be more

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,270
accepting and see what are the

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:14,709
possibilities outside of true poland'

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:16,840
amalgamating that okay so oh so these

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,520
are the three network topologies that we

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,380
essentially deal with how the internet

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,660
started out was the sensitive

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,020
distributed system itself

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,000
on the right my side where the client

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,070
and the HTTP server was handled by a

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,580
group of people or a single person so it

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:36,570
made more sense to share data and files

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,670
in a much more seamless way how the web

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,160
has progressed is towards a centralized

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,100
system where a few organizations or

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,020
corporations control how we access our

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,470
information as well which basically

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,150
means that if the central node was to go

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,740
down all that access to information

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,150
would go away eventually so and

00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,190
considering now we are at that

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,960
centralized system we want to shift back

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,230
to either a distributed method or a

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,360
decentralized thing so um what are the

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,910
current problems with the centralized

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,520
system it's a one is of course our

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,800
single point of failure Wow so just to

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,080
give you that perspective so Google

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,460
about three to four years back went on

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,570
for about five minutes which brought

00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:25,350
down web traffic by over 40 percent in

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:27,570
Jan 2011 Egypt was able to shut down 88

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,600
percent of its web traffic because they

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,060
control the logistics behind it and

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,180
that's that's the power that those

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,690
central nodes have right sense ship

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,060
again so Russia has anti-extremist laws

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,410
if you if you post or share post

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,480
opposition content there are lot of

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,610
countries like China Bahrain Israel

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,860
control the sort of information you can

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,800
access there are banned keywords in

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,500
China ok so again it's censorship that's

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,890
that's pulling away from the centralized

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,800
system as well impermanent so everyone's

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,160
aware of error 404 so one is of course

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,320
with how much kind of information you

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,610
want to share out if it's given with

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,250
consent that you're putting away

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,870
information and archiving it but what

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,150
happens if those central nodes go down

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,880
and your users are solved with this

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,380
massive message itself bandwidth latency

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,989
multiple sites are going to me this is

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,610
one of the most important failure points

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,820
of the current where the internet is

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,800
find out a with the advent of low-cost

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,960
smartphones or what's happening is the

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,819
the way people can access Internet is

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,789
going exponentially but the logistics

00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,530
behind are not at the same rate so which

00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,660
is causing a lot of latency for example

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,880
if I was to ping a server in either

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,430
lence from New Delhi it takes about 200

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,840
milliseconds if I was to do Iowa from

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,400
New Delhi its per 3 or 50 milliseconds

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,979
and that time is eventually gonna rise

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,569
because people who are accessing that

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,479
kind of information they will grow at an

00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,190
exponential stage which brings from a

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,610
problem bandwidth so for example I have

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,889
to download a 1 GB file a movie file and

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,650
braid here has to do the same so we are

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,759
collectively using 2 GB and example you

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,620
guys want to do that so we're using

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,380
multiplier into that bandwidth as well

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,940
now if I have that file already on me he

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,240
can just access it from me was this

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,789
doing multiple Network hops to get that

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,860
information in multiple devices if there

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,090
let's say accessing that central node to

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,000
access that information

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,650
okay well the channel is restricted so

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,030
it becomes slower for you to access

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,870
those files so that's another problem

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,280
we're dealing with offline so we're

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,620
still living in a world of online

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,840
offline at the end of the day that

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,219
central node I keep repeating the word

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,320
central own because it's a centralized

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,699
system that we're dealing with and if

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,070
that goes offline you're not able to

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:48,009
access that information for example a 1

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,900
GB file was there on that so I'm not

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:52,120
able to access it but if he has it why

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,430
can't I use that why can't we use that

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,259
together security so again so we we

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,550
think security as encryption of data but

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,159
what we are actually doing is which is

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,560
encrypting the route to access that data

00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:08,530
and not the data itself if we were to do

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,180
that that basically means either will be

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,659
security experts or we'd have to hire

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,699
one so we have to in terms of give that

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:17,740
power to ourselves where we're able to

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,419
share power hide the kind information

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,229
you want to do and then share whatever

00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:25,390
that's relevant to us so those are the

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,469
problems that we're dealing with and

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,210
[Music]

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,190
okay so what's the common thread that

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,130
connects all these problems it's

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,940
location based addressing if I was to

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,790
access a file on my own web

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,260
I'd have to do multiple Network hops I'm

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,510
sitting in New Delhi okay so this

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,120
doesn't let hook up to your first then

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,010
then somewhere in the US and a couple of

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,320
cities in the u.s. itself to access that

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,620
file which means I'm accessing a

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,420
physical location okay why why can't it

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,360
be something much more simpler in that

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,660
sense so what's the solution

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,460
content-based addressing it basically

00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,990
means I'm taking their file passing it

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,930
through a hash function which returns

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,940
the hash of the file itself and it's

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,600
almost like a digital fingerprint of the

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,810
file this is essentially what it uses to

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,430
track changes and repositories as well

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,600
we make the content it's of content

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:27,470
addressable okay so which brings us to

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,870
IB FS so ipfs is essentially a protocol

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,190
and it's a peer-to-peer method of

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,030
storing and sharing hyper media in a

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,730
distributed file system itself it

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:41,060
started out with a mission or a vision

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,500
to replace HTTP itself which I

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,160
personally and that's my personal

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,440
opinion on it it will happen because I

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,070
mean the Internet has evolved to a

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:55,730
certain extent but not from HTTP HTTP

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:58,010
from Content perspective itself so

00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,750
advantages so no content duplicate see

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,670
so what happens so if I'm let's say

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,150
uploading a file to the ipfs it returns

00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,500
a hash right and wait he was let's say

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,180
sitting in another part of the country

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,950
and he uploads the same file it will

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,770
return the same hash value which

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:16,840
basically means I cannot have duplicate

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:21,080
data on the ipfs network integrity

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:23,240
because it the data structure behind

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,940
which will correlate or is the data

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,190
structure behind is the MOCA tag so if

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,590
there was let's say in that image file a

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,719
pixel was to change it will change the

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,719
entire hash value itself which basically

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,330
means I will be able to detect if my

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,800
data has been tampered with there's of

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,690
course high performance now because you

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,570
don't have dependency on central nodes

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,010
but but nodes around you itself which

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,560
means you will be able to access that

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,870
information much more faster it's

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,020
cheaper hosting for people who hosting a

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,270
lot

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,300
data okay they have to pay thousands of

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,970
dollars it becomes a more cost effective

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,650
way to use ipfs and distribute data

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,660
internally as well

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,400
censorship resistant again there's no

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,350
central dependency so nobody can block

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,380
key words okay you can you can post as

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,090
much content as you want and yeah keep

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,160
giving sense if you're free access to

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,050
offline data so those central north

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:21,040
nodes never go down you will always have

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:24,770
nodes with you as if now they're about

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,660
3,000 ipfs nodes that are active right

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,190
now and you can host data all over the

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:35,240
world with these guys so yeah okay

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,550
always saves the world okay so who else

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,900
is using IP FS you port it's basically

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:44,780
an identification system that uses I

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,860
uses ipfs to create an identity for you

00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,920
guys

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:53,180
Akasha project is a social network that

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:56,470
again uses IP FS to have sense ship free

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,060
content posting open Bazaar is

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,430
essentially a marketplace where buyers

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,030
and traders can transact online without

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:08,060
any platform fees of they use ipfs for

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,100
the distribution methods itself Argo is

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:15,410
if you if you just put it across its

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:19,340
Dropbox or ipfs yeah okay so this is

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:22,340
where we it comes in so we have seen

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,800
like you know what Drupal what ifs is

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,290
about its it's a file so distributed

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,810
file system built over the core

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,400
technology with blockchain has but it is

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,070
meant for sharing files on a

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,440
decentralized system and so the common

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,570
philosophy Drupal is all about openness

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,120
and content and giving editors the power

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,190
right and ipfs is about keeping them

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,790
keeping them maintaining the integrity

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:49,130
and keeping it immutable right and it's

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,750
it appeared very natural that you know

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,510
these two things have to come together

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,340
or might be very early stage at this

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,440
point of time but they will come

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,660
together to probably solve bigger

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,730
problems right and that's so just let

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,000
quickly go through the internal data

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,130
structure that is behind ipfs Addison

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,530
Merkel dad it's a cyclic trees trees

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,030
structure where each of the file is

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,000
actually split into different multiple

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,100
blocks and each of the blocks have their

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,630
own hash and the combination of the

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,820
child hash is used to generate the

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,230
parents hash okay so in this example is

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,270
they've already mentioned that if you

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,640
just change one of the blocks at the

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,860
last level try to modify it it will

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,170
actually change the top most parents

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,930
hash itself so that ensures integrity

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,290
and that also handles redundancy of

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:40,570
files and this is something which is a

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,570
similar behavior if you notice on an s3

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,440
if you upload two exact files internally

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,760
as s3 on AWS handles redundancy not sure

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,480
if they're using Merkle tree or mobile

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:55,750
deck but yes something like that happens

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,730
yes so now we started brainstorming what

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,100
would be the possible use cases of ipfs

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,530
around Drupal or web sites in general

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,510
okay so let's as a back-end storage

00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:08,320
system so Drupal file system lets upload

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,970
create to file entities same image we

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,370
upload in two different media entities

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:16,030
and we have duplicate copies on the file

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,470
system right if something like ipfs or

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,050
the algorithm that no merkel dad

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,520
provides we could actually this is not a

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,140
problem for everyone for a small site

00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,960
but when you are storing large amount of

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,880
content behind a dam it is actually a

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,010
problem and that's where these

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,850
technologies inspire us to you know put

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,650
this method of creating the signatures

00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,530
using hash to handle redundancy so that

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,240
could be one use case in the space of

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,180
Internet and web sites right web

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,220
applications then version control so we

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,960
already mentioned get uses assembly this

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,430
a local local tree algorithm right but

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,910
version control system for images behind

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:58,750
dam you know large video files if you

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,580
try to upload similar video files we can

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,980
use a versioning system which is not

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,080
actually creating or two full copies of

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,260
the same video file which is slight

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,970
changes right so that could save on

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,030
storage and have better versioning

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,699
system on for media assets large media

00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,259
assets and CDN this

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:19,269
looks to be the most promising and

00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,589
interesting one so we had this problem

00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,379
of network hops

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:26,319
you know accessing a web server which is

00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:30,009
based in us here and we are accessing

00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:31,839
from India or any remote location the

00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,879
that's where the Sirians solved a

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,609
problem to a point where it is no

00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,889
replicating the assets to save 810 data

00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:41,769
centers and you are able to access the

00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:43,600
nearest one yet ipfs can be used to

00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:46,029
solve that problem to the next level

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,029
where it's not only 8 or 10 data centers

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:50,980
but it's across the world on a full ipfs

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,259
network of two thousand five thousand

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,199
nodes right so I think that's the one of

00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:59,939
the very interesting possibilities that

00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:03,309
that can be used in a very near future

00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:05,559
then we started more brainstorming okay

00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:08,290
how do we give the power what Drupal

00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,149
provides to the content editors so ipfs

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,239
is still a technology which only are

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:16,209
very take people tech savvy people can

00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:18,399
actually know leverage and that's the

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,139
beauty of Drupal you know giving editors

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,600
and the content creators that power to

00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,549
manage and handle content so this is a

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,350
small blueprint that we made and is

00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:28,929
there's a small demo based on that just

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,429
after this so it's it's a really simple

00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:33,879
and it was create or the content on

00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:36,160
Drupal we actually push the node object

00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,319
as adjacent to ipfs we maintain the

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,259
mapping of entity ID and the hash return

00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:43,959
by ipfs within Drupal okay and that's

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,970
what is again used by the users to you

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,129
know fetch the content now this there

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,660
are lot of problems in it with this is

00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,509
not something which will actually solve

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,919
a serious major business problem right

00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:59,139
out but yeah this is a good starting

00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:02,609
point and so yeah I have a small demo

00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,609
right there sorry

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:10,999
so we made a small module which

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,499
interacts with so I would like to know

00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:13,999
and this so what we are doing is we are

00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,720
uploading three images on three

00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:18,889
different nodes

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,970
two of them are exact same images and it

00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,249
is being sent to

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,319
ipfs I will skip this three images

00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:27,170
upload I'll just show you the final

00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:29,119
result so yeah this is where we are

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,649
uploading two exact images in two

00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,749
different entity IDs are different but

00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:36,019
the hash return by IP FS is exactly same

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:39,170
if you know if you notice the 30 and 30

00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:45,860
second one yeah so this is what I was

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:49,129
referring to okay so this is a smaller

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,379
demo vision where we are trying to use

00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:55,970
this with the media system of Drupal

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:58,879
okay and the challenges now to solve

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:01,699
problems to make it like actually usable

00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,929
in like real world scenarios there are

00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,790
certain problems which needs to be

00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:07,369
addressed probably as I said it's a very

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,559
early stage or searching in ipfs the

00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:11,480
only way to address the content is of

00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,699
using the hash that it generates right

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,679
so we cannot it's not a full-fledged

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:17,629
database it's a distributed file system

00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,370
in the end right so we cannot actually

00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:21,230
search based on keyword or do you try to

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,329
access the content in any other way

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,029
apart from the say hash as a primary key

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:28,309
that's it so that's a problem so and

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,749
again as the second as the complex

00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:31,879
content relationships the the

00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:33,980
flexibility that Drupal provides us to

00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,439
reference content to and reference to if

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,839
we can create no complex hierarchy of

00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:41,990
content pieces right that cannot be

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,540
handled very easily on ipfs but that is

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:48,290
something we need probably moving

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,470
forward might be solved ipfs has views

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:54,709
back and now we love views everyone does

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:58,459
and that is what something which Drupal

00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:02,600
is Drupal provides to end-users to make

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:04,189
things fast quickly and you again the

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,390
same problem that we have with searching

00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,779
with or the only way to access the

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:11,659
content access the files on ipfs is the

00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:14,240
hash it's I don't see a straight up way

00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:16,220
of doing it but again this is a problem

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,889
which needs to be resolved and often

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,870
enough content on ipfs is very common so

00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:22,630
for example you know

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:26,319
previous blueprint that we discussed if

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,630
we get to lose the mapping of entity IDs

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,059
in the and the hash mapping if you feel

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,580
somehow lose it the content which is

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,110
already on is on ipfs is orphan you

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,000
there's no way to figure that and find

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,150
that out unless someone else upload set

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,860
again and get the same hash right so

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,930
that's these are the few the problems

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,830
that needs to be addressed to know where

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:50,770
it becomes a real problem solver and but

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,950
yeah the other use cases not necessarily

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,620
wrong with Drupal but in general is for

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,870
archivist who if you want to store large

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,840
amount of data and make that no

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,020
permanently available yes ipfs is a good

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,370
solution or to store it's cheap it's

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,710
it's it's cheap and the performance is

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,480
pretty good if you're delivering large

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,040
amount of content as the example we

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,980
discussed about the Sirian if a really

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,130
large amount of no amount of content to

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,110
users or media to users ipfs is a good

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,200
solution as cheap and where you actually

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,929
save a lot of money on bandwidth

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,340
researchers researchers are always sort

00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:31,900
of funds like you know running short of

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,730
funds and hosting is is a large amount

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,010
of research data is a problem so now

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,320
they need it to access them really fast

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,910
and you know in a cost-effective way so

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,820
for them research it's a good solution

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,130
it's a good way to approach I think and

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,860
content creators or just about the

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,170
spirit of web keeping content out there

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,800
without keeping it uncensored and at a

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,120
low cost

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:59,740
I think for them it's a good good start

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:04,750
yeah now we understood how true Polly

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:07,059
can amalgamate with ipfs itself so so we

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,570
we are running at that almost at a

00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:13,720
threshold where the cost of producing

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:16,300
content okay will go much higher than

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,660
cost of delivering content okay and

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,520
Drupal is content centric so and if

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,400
there's a there's an alternative to

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,390
avoid that I think I PFS becomes

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,570
inevitable in that sense again like with

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,140
that for content creators it you get to

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,310
empower yourself okay

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,050
what the sort of content you want to

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,650
share the sort of content you want to

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,360
talk about okay so because it's

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,250
content-addressable and reusing content

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,320
signing so DDoS attacks become

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,630
impossible because there's no physical

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,900
location to do those DDoS attacks so

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,140
again you save money on security

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,460
measures as well because there is no

00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:00,020
origin server and there's a lot of

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,410
internet penetration that's happening in

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,380
the developing countries for them it

00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:10,970
becomes much more easier and faster to

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,980
access the web itself okay so now we as

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,070
a community need to come about and think

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:21,470
as to what all possible use cases can be

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:24,950
can can add-on okay and that's about it

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:34,220
from us I think we wrapped up exactly in

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:36,170
time yeah just thanking a couple of more

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,660
people who are not here but helped us

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,090
put this demo and this stuff together so

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,700
therefore people from our team and I

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,960
just met this gentleman from Wipro who

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,180
or they are actually working on

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,370
something putting Drupal and hyper laser

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,640
together they are having a BOF of that

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,350
this is by4 at 3:45 p.m. I guess so if

00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,320
you are interested in taking that

00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:01,970
discussion further join us for

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,640
contributions prints Friday yes

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:11,480
definitely and you can always give us

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:14,150
feedback yes we can open up to Q&A guys

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,750
any questions or we can okay oh yeah

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,750
okay

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,470
nice work guys thanks for presenting

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,590
this is this module available for

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,570
community to try yes this is okay could

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,809
you mention that on your slide somewhere

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,490
when you post them on your session so

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,890
when we upload the deck we'll upload it

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,740
with the module perfect I have a

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:42,630
question so I think you guys are

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:47,050
mentioning this file system stuff from

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:49,170
public standpoint things are open how

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,510
would something like this work when

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,460
things need to be there needs to be

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,090
access control so I'm a researcher so

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,370
this is very interesting right

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,780
so how can something like this work with

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,559
access control in some ways you have

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:07,510
done a CDN write with hashing right but

00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,120
what what about access control because

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,740
that's the next level so when you can we

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,330
actually do the signature function that

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,370
the function that actually generates

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,530
that hash when you upload a file or any

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:21,730
content on ipfs you can actually use a

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:23,580
secret key to encrypt that so ipfs has

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,380
that possibility

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,450
that's encryption not necessarily access

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,880
control so you are saying oh our stuff

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,640
is open but nobody can can can get to it

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,410
that's you know I don't think many of

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,750
the pH I data people would like that

00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,460
kind of you know encryption level access

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,710
control access control me yeah but he

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,950
can get this stuff right so it's

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:47,770
different see the content is out there

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,900
only way to access is if you keep it non

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,420
encrypted or only way to access is using

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,920
the hash key right if you encrypt it

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,590
again you need the secret key with it

00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,510
but the more applicate a CL is more on

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,059
the application side right and that's

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,240
where systems like Drupal needs to be

00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,620
able to talk to ipfs in a way that it

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,420
provides that flexibility when I was

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,490
talking about complex entity

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,960
relationships there's this gets into

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:17,380
that okay perfect thank you Thanks hey

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,470
guys thanks so since this is a you know

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,820
sort of like a you're investigating

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,290
technologies that are not really

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,179
business ready yet right like you're

00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,160
looking very far forward do you have a

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:29,500
roadmap or do you have like maybe some

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,440
next stages where are you going to build

00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,809
that connection so that

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,429
we have like something as a CDN or

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:39,690
something we can use on our sites the

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:41,220
next movie that we showed was just know

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,889
something we just put together in two

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,600
days before the triple kahan sure but we

00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:48,120
have been researching and doing pocs

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,309
around other blockchain technologies

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,870
apart for my PFS but ipfs was one we

00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:54,240
figured out that which is closest to

00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:56,759
solve business problems right and I

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,110
think for example if you look at the one

00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,750
of the examples they've mentioned was

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,389
about Dropbox which is using IP FS

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,549
something like Dropbox so I think CDN is

00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:07,529
we are not actively working on it right

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,980
now to build it something like that is

00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:13,080
more of a POC stuff but I think Syrians

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,110
should be coming up someone should be

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,340
doing it very soon okay with the media

00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,659
module ok implementing a simple

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,269
versioning of let's say the hashes

00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,399
itself and you can avoid duplicate large

00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:28,110
files yeah that should be the first

00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:33,720
thing that we should be actually getting

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:37,590
to immediately after thanks hey thanks

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,840
very good presentation I had to like

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:43,440
related questions about sort of the way

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:47,000
hashes work in IVFs the first one is

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,529
I've heard a lot of criticism around

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,750
like for instance Facebook and other

00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:54,659
social networks they use hashing for

00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:57,230
files because when you delete something

00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:00,570
it isn't necessarily ever deleted from

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,009
the servers it's the pointer is deleted

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,899
but because they store hashes of

00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:06,750
everything to prevent duplication the

00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,190
file is actually still out there so I

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,860
guess my question is one what do you

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,500
think about that and then the related

00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,750
one is if all the files are being hashed

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,309
it seems like that would actually well

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:21,870
it would make tampering with files easy

00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,879
to detect it would also make

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,909
surveillance of who's receiving those

00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:28,080
files with file traffic much easier

00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:31,559
because all you have to do is look for

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,169
the hashes of particular files that you

00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:36,299
as a government or a agency or an

00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:38,669
Internet company doesn't want someone

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:42,059
access and all of a sudden the metadata

00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:43,139
has it all right yeah so yeah so I guess

00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,570
I just learned of your thoughts on those

00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:46,899
two

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:49,629
about the first one so you comforted the

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:52,989
first one I just don't like if you

00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:55,809
delete something so the guys behind ipfs

00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:58,269
they are currently there is a mechanism

00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:00,669
where a content which is which is not

00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:02,679
which is not being exist so they age out

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,259
and it's still out there but eventually

00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,590
they age out and they are overwritten at

00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:10,859
some point so there this is no I think

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,779
they are working on improvising this

00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,669
aging out and no deletion process but it

00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,470
is not something that you can you know

00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:19,389
actively okay I want to delete this you

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,700
cannot do that it will age out because

00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:24,429
it is not being accessed so that's what

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,639
how happy i PF s guys are handling it

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:28,809
and because in the end when you when we

00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:31,179
say that you know it's like it's

00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:33,369
permanent and it's permanent but it

00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:35,679
could be overwritten because the number

00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:37,539
of nodes are limited in the amount of

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,669
storage that each node is giving is

00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:41,169
limited recurrently right when the

00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:43,659
number of nodes increase probably the

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:45,549
possibilities might change so that's

00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:51,159
what this current state is okay and

00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:52,869
about the hash itself like yeah so if we

00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:54,970
are in a foreign that for example we are

00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:58,119
in this room and we have five nodes here

00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,729
and we are communicating and you have a

00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,979
file copy which I need it's just between

00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:04,749
me and you it's not something well

00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:06,340
there's no central point where the

00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:09,489
transaction are being logged catcher

00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,470
yeah so yes like the standard blockchain

00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:15,580
stuff that you actually can access the

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:19,179
full ledger right there is but not sure

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,859
if if it is being handled right now it's

00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,809
observed absolutely like blockchain so

00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:26,399
the problem you are seeing yeah persists

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,399
right yes oh yes thanks

00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:33,009
hi so my question is is it looks like

00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:35,679
you're still tying on a base level to

00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:40,149
the centralized system as far as like I

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,669
build a site and I have my images or

00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:44,559
PDFs or whatever hosted on ipfs but that

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,649
on the back end but that front end is

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,289
still a physical location that somebody

00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:53,950
goes to to to at least get the the base

00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:55,390
links do you have any sort of plan to

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,820
offer because the

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:00,190
because a hash is not a very

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,840
distributable piece of information you

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,320
know it's not very memorable but I

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,520
personally can't memorize 3264 you know

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:12,160
36 character digits anyway so do you

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,520
have any sort of implementation model

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,640
for imposing a truly decentralized sort

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,460
of like let's say I want to publish a

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,640
newsletter that would be disapproved by

00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,250
certain governments not saying I want to

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:31,330
picking a picking an example nobody here

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,530
wants to is there a way that that could

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,559
that there could be like for instance

00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:39,010
essentially an address that then goes to

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:41,380
the decentralized a simplified almost

00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:45,130
like a bitly it's for a lack of a better

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,100
example so the organization itself

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,100
they provide ipfs dot iu so that's that

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:53,350
becomes your central entry point to the

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,600
complete you know the files stored on

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:58,540
the IPS fest network itself but you can

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,910
actually put your own DNS server which

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:03,640
actually which can directly talk to the

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:06,910
IP FS system behind without actually

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,520
depending on ipfs guys themselves okay

00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:11,799
that is one second if you look at this

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,309
blueprint at the right part I missed

00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,410
that one

00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,000
so that this was something which I was

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,650
also thinking about in the end we are

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,260
putting a centralized Drupal application

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,660
behind all the content all the content

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:26,860
on ipfs how do you promote distribution

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:30,370
of that so in that case we can think of

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,440
a prepackaged Drupal profile which comes

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:36,640
with mapping which comes with the

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,070
current mapping of you know the hash and

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,220
the entity IDs so all you need is a

00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:43,270
Drupal application which knows to and

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,000
which understands how to talk to the

00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,880
ipfs behind it and has a first starting

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,730
point of existing mapping you know I

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,140
think that's is a workaround I don't

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,640
know if it is a full-fledged solution

00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,650
that's why I mentioned you know if

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,450
public repositories of that web sites

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,760
you know anyone can deploy that and

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,919
access all the content now within this

00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,330
mapping of the entities and the hash

00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:09,060
they can further be put into

00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,950
i PFS of the full mapping and then that

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:14,160
can be accessed by you know so you

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:18,200
basically just distribute one key and it

00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,200
fetches all the mapping and then

00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:26,850
interprets it out yeah which could be

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,620
talked about but because if your bill is

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,450
all about dynamic contents like if I

00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,220
edit something if I post a new article

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,980
yeah you know and I want it

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,870
decentralized across the vast network

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,780
that's that's that's the ideal there

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,040
would be the beautify in Drupal it the

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,290
structure is pretty complex

00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,780
so there are few of frameworks so there

00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,850
are browsers who utilizes ipfs so all

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,250
you do is install that browser

00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:53,670
it creates ipfs node and also lets you

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:55,980
publish web pages on it but again the

00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,960
power available is very limited compared

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,160
to Drupal from a material perspective

00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,050
all right thank you very much thanks

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,260
last question I think a great

00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:09,330
presentation first of all what I see

00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,400
this is this is gonna revolutionize the

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,980
Internet and and I'd say about five to

00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,270
ten years oh yeah absolutely I mean

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,800
because once you see all this stuff

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,470
happened in third-world countries all

00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,050
that not only not only from a honest

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,110
open you know interpretation of all the

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:27,000
data but also financially so as a

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,700
two-part question I'm sure business I

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,680
didn't take number one I say this is

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,600
potentially being the next Bitcoin wave

00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,040
of date not only you know not currency

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,260
but you're talking about data here and

00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,000
what would equal kind of investment

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,440
opportunities do you see in the future

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,200
for something like this

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,240
business-wise this first part question

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,180
and the second part is how do you see

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,530
how do you foresee governments and other

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,630
agencies sort of trying to circumvent

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,950
this this new wave of information that's

00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:59,670
going to be freely spreading through the

00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:02,749
internet open source is free but

00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,749
[Music]

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,030
information will always be available

00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,640
freely in that sense okay

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,950
whether Drupal jumps the bandwagon or

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,440
not it's gonna happen either way people

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,809
will be

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,649
in content they'll be sonship free okay

00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:26,000
it's it's about how we as rootless

00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:28,389
utilize this new technology in place one

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,220
Bennett who are the guy behind ipfs

00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:35,600
started this with a clear-cut mission of

00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:37,639
to replace HTTP so yeah of course

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,230
there's no governmental control there's

00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:40,730
no central control that's gonna happen

00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,419
but that's gonna happen either way

00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,259
because we are moving to a world where

00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:48,409
information should be available more

00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:50,629
freely okay and there should be no

00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:52,039
central organizations or corporations

00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:53,809
that should be controlling it at the

00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,730
annuity and we as an open-source

00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:57,950
community understand the value of that

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,159
and that's why it it just only makes

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,350
sense to bring them together Wow could

00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,110
you the first question no just just

00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:08,149
business yeah investment I mean you know

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,250
cryptocurrency was kind of a thing and I

00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:13,250
see this being similar but with

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:16,940
different intentions okay so I'll be one

00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:19,429
of no definitely not being equivalent to

00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,070
cryptocurrency at all so that's one use

00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:25,580
case of blockchain ipfs is another use

00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:27,379
case absolutely whatsoever so if you're

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,059
thinking in terms of do you want to

00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,500
invest something here I mean that's

00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:31,940
that's cryptocurrency and that's totally

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,370
separate from from that perspective

00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,179
there's a lot of mining there's a lot of

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,889
proof of work that that goes on that

00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:43,009
nothing in terms of this is basically a

00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:45,169
protocol to share and store files across

00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:54,040
a distributed file system itself right

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:58,599
okay so yeah does that thanks guys

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,599
