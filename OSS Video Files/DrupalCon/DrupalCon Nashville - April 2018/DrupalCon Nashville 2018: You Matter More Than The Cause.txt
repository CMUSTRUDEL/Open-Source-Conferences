Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: You Matter More Than The Cause
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	What could be better than doing work that you believe really matters? Whether you’re pulling all-nighters for a new startup, burning the midnight oil on the project of your dreams, or helping launch a candidate into public office, it’s hard to beat the thrill of making a difference.

That passion has a dark side, though: When everyone’s giving 110%, the margin for error vanishes and the potential for burnout skyrockets. In this talk, we’ll look at the ways inspiring missions and the best intentions can backfire, learn to recognize the danger signs, and discuss how to protect ourselves and our teams.
