Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: You Matter More Than The Cause
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	What could be better than doing work that you believe really matters? Whether you’re pulling all-nighters for a new startup, burning the midnight oil on the project of your dreams, or helping launch a candidate into public office, it’s hard to beat the thrill of making a difference.

That passion has a dark side, though: When everyone’s giving 110%, the margin for error vanishes and the potential for burnout skyrockets. In this talk, we’ll look at the ways inspiring missions and the best intentions can backfire, learn to recognize the danger signs, and discuss how to protect ourselves and our teams.

am second slight hi welcome to a talk

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,640
that will involve absolutely zero

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:23,340
references to form API or data migration

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,410
I wasn't expecting the positive reaction

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,490
to that but you know what that works too

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,289
hi my name is Eaton for those of you who

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,300
I haven't like ranted at about

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,120
structured content at some point in the

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,800
past like 48 hours I worked for a

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,290
company called lullaby and we do web

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,829
stuff come by our booth pick up a floppy

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,989
disk come to our party yeah Drupal it's

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,210
really cool I really enjoy the work that

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,620
I do I've been working at all about and

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,829
in the Drupal community in general for

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,710
more than a decade now which is super

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,500
sobering because I just realized I

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,899
literally did not have gray hair before

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,369
I started working with Drupal which I'm

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:08,330
not saying it's causation but you know

00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,770
it's it's a lot of fun though because

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,260
it's an agency style arrangement so I

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,799
get to as solve problems and help people

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,869
and like sort of like kool-aid man into

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,520
interesting problems and help people

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,439
wrestle through organizational

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,670
challenges and stuff like that and I get

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,680
to work with cool and amazing and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,439
talented people and it's just a load of

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,799
fun and one of the things that I love

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,470
about coming to Drupal con in particular

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,630
and like other events where there's like

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,020
a strong like community of people who

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,180
are all sort of like you know they we've

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,159
gathered around some sort of cool thing

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,299
that we we care about and we make is

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,680
that there's a lot of really amazing and

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,619
fun stuff that we do that actually

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,020
matters like Eve even outside of just

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,909
purely the technical stuff like figuring

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,009
out like ways to communicate complexity

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,560
and deal with complex data problems

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,159
that's an Edward Tufte graph for the

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,619
data nerds in the house or like you know

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,149
even in the content and editorial track

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,629
which you know I'm a big you know

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,620
content strategy guy at this point and

00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:15,780
so like figuring out how

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,890
how to make our communication clear and

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,500
to be better at articulating both like

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,959
internally our documentation or

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,030
principles or goals to even helping

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,280
clients with that stuff or like you

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,260
noted building out websites that make a

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
difference in people's lives I mean I

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,470
think that was a big part of what you

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,129
know Drees was talking about in in his

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,829
keynote you know we are having an impact

00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,650
on other people and that's a really

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:46,620
empowering and exciting and energizing

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,239
kind of thing and the intersection of

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,250
all that stuff really matters you know I

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,079
I took that very seriously I decided to

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,000
take it out but I had originally a

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,780
photograph of me at like age five and

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,239
Superman underoos like with this look on

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,150
my face that is just deadly serious like

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,620
yeah yeah I've got to go stop a train

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,620
this is serious

00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:15,629
we're here because for the most part it

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,419
matters to us like this isn't just a

00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,829
thing we have to go to obviously you

00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,150
know DrupalCon has gotten big enough

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:22,260
that you know there's always a certain

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,760
percentage of that and there's nothing

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,889
wrong with that but a lot of the people

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,299
who are really consider themselves a

00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,579
part of the Drupal community and who

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,129
engage in like conversations like this

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:36,299
are here because it really means

00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:38,280
something to them and we care about what

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,560
happens and we care about that impact on

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,930
people's lives and we want to make what

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,569
we do better because that makes other

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,900
people's lives better and the community

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,449
were a part of amplifies that it makes

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,780
it better and so oh I guess I didn't

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,780
take it out

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:05,900
but the thing is there's always a but

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:11,130
two that kind of exciting invigorating

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:14,400
energizing force the that awesome power

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,790
of like stuff that matters has a real

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,320
dark side and I mean I think there's

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,540
there's a real common thing that we're

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,450
used to engaging with like crappy fake

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,710
meaning like you know hey we're gonna

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,540
come together as a community and

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,400
incrementally reduce the amount of time

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,410
it takes to deliver takeout in the Bay

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,350
Area by 37 seconds that's not like the

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,810
kind of life affirming meaning that I'm

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,210
talking about if anybody wants to

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,400
explore that whole like mess there's a

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,680
great book by Evenki morozov's called to

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,020
save everything click here it's about

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,560
the idea of the technology solution ISM

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,110
and like the idea that we can just throw

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,110
startups at society to solve everything

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,479
that's that's a whole nother track but

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,570
I'm talking about a lot more personal

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,530
side of things and especially when it

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:10,169
means when it's it involves that kind of

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,419
mission and meaning that we really do

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:16,380
actually feel I feel like it matters on

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,990
human terms not just you know making

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,340
making a new food delivery startup man

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,720
there's gonna be somebody who works at a

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,479
food delivery startup in the audience

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,490
that's Murphy's Law I'm talking about

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,289
like burnout and identity and the stuff

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,570
that makes us who we are so I'm gonna

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:34,039
start with talking about open source

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:39,600
naturally I'm gonna talk about an

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:43,200
unnamed community a group of people that

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,720
came together many years ago they wanted

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,120
to build something cool together and as

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,289
time as time went on they decided they

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,640
wanted to do something even bigger they

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,789
wanted to change the world they wanted

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,860
to build something that would make life

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:57,960
better for other people who had to do

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,560
similar things they have like a cool

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,289
origin story they've got a charismatic

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,810
founder

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:08,490
yes man that is that is a gazing off

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,969
into the distance thoughtfully photo if

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,419
I've ever seen one and you know and they

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:17,250
had a real community you know group of

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,009
people who stuck together and did stuff

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,080
and cared for each other like it's great

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:24,900
and you know year after year it got

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,400
bigger and bigger and bigger and you

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,810
know this community of people who used

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
to just be you know some folks who

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,120
talked to each other and and you know

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,159
brainstormed it did stuff ended up doing

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,770
conferences suddenly they needed people

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:40,080
did you like infrastructure work to

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,669
support the conferences just to tell

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,550
people about the cool thing they were

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,800
doing and like the project itself grew

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,090
to like dozens of people hundreds of

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,509
people thousands of people like and

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,889
thousands of volunteers no less but the

00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,110
thing is is at that scale they also

00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,340
needed people who got paid because you

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,779
know it's you you've got to have

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,550
somebody you know some people that you

00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,560
can just assign and put on tasks you

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,919
know regardless and so ok well you know

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,710
there's paid staff and you know it was

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,440
really cool and the thing is as all

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:17,339
these people were extremely passionate

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,529
they cared about what they were doing it

00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,500
was good stuff but regardless of that

00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:26,190
fact tension and pressure sort of

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,169
growing and you know lots of really

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,550
deeply uncomfortable questions started

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,020
bubbling up to the surface in the middle

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,919
of this tension and pressure things like

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,889
well how will we do all of this stuff

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,839
that needs to get done like even as many

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:42,479
of us as there are there is still more

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,189
stuff that has to be done we're still

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,439
not big enough to do all of the big

00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,960
things that we care about like how well

00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,849
how are you contributing I've cuz I've

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,439
been over here like you know I I pulled

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:55,229
an all-nighter trying to you know trying

00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,729
to get this to happen and like well okay

00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,229
so hold on I've been a volunteer for

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,409
like eight years

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:04,409
and now that person's getting paid to do

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:06,449
this like I volunteered to do it

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:08,879
meanwhile the person who's getting paid

00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:11,490
is saying oh yeah it must be real nice

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,650
to just be able to go home if you decide

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,680
you don't want to do it anymore

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,560
this is my job I have to do this

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,600
so this weird weird dynamics of like you

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,520
know everybody was feeling like this

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,870
growing sense of friction and tension

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:32,940
and everybody was like I was expected to

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:39,330
give 110 percent which is not a real

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:42,930
percent this kind of pressure generated

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,720
really predictable outcomes the people

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,610
who just gave a hundred and ten who just

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,690
sacrificed themselves and poured

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:55,290
themselves out purely voluntarily became

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,630
the heroes of the community and healthy

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,020
boundaries things like ah you know what

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,870
theoretically I could like do that this

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,060
weekend but I actually am just gonna

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,060
take some time and like chill and I need

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,420
to pet my cat or you know heaven forbid

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,839
like I've got kids they might want to

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,300
see me you know that kind of stuff can

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,070
become rarer and rarer and rarer in

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,839
those situations and it's certainly not

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,870
the kind of stuff that's lauded and

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,700
celebrated in the worst case scenarios

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,320
in the middle of high-stress situations

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,990
where everybody's under a crunch and

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,640
everybody feels like we you know we've

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,120
gotta come together we got to make this

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,430
happen

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,589
it can even be treated as betrayal when

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,580
somebody has those kinds of times like

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:44,400
hey I'm just um I'm going to get a

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,100
coffee I'm just going to go chill how

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,910
could you do that how could you

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,459
and people burnt out like I saw people

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,980
drop out entirely just because it was

00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,540
just too much but they tagged out and

00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,459
the thing is the survivors that were

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,900
left behind they had to pick up this

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,700
laughs because now there's fewer people

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,120
to do all this stuff that we've got to

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,700
do and they got more stressed out and

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,589
the real problem is that looming over

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:15,209
all of this was the big cause the thing

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,130
mattered the thing that brought us all

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,170
together and they gave us purpose and

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,970
gave us direction is how we impacted

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,070
people's lives and if you stopped to

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,650
breathe you're letting the team down if

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,700
you take a break you're leaving us

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,980
you're leaving

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:35,310
team if you leave you're leaving the

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:37,320
cause so plot twist I'm not actually

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,310
talking about the Drupal community well

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,870
I am but I'm also talking about a

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,880
different project that I worked on a

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,150
different organization that I was a part

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,500
of for years before I joined the Drupal

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,500
community which was Willow Creek Church

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,460
in Illinois probably one of the largest

00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:02,430
mega churches in the Midwest it has a

00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:04,020
food court and a bookstore now I know

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:10,740
there's some people who are like ah

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:12,690
that's no star but like it's an

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,690
interesting place and I don't mean that

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,730
in a sarcastic way like it was founded

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,530
in the 1970s in a movie theater because

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,970
like some 20 year olds wanted to get

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,950
together and like you know the classic

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,380
we want to do things differently you

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,170
know and what it was one of the first

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,880
churches to explicitly focus on people

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,560
who didn't go to church and people who

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,480
didn't like church and didn't like the

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,950
culture of church they said okay that's

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,450
who we are for and who were about and

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:42,600
and you know just a couple of

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,330
20-something people and now 20,000

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,520
people show up for the Easter service

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,560
they had to rent out Rose my horizon

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,230
when they wanted to do like an all

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,200
church meeting so it kind of got nuts

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,930
and they just keep growing yeah they're

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,460
the food court serves excellent tacos

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,580
and the interesting thing is is it's not

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,430
just about size like they do important

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,740
and meaningful stuff like at that scale

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,210
they have thousands of volunteers

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,430
hundreds of full-time staff like

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,650
programs to help like you know poor and

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,180
homeless people locally like single moms

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,040
in the area not members of the church

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,790
even just like single moms in the area

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,520
can say I need a car and come and get a

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,200
car for free because they operated a

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,030
scale where they can say well if you've

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,840
got a beater donated to the church and

00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:32,310
one of our 47 mechanics will fix it up

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,710
and we can give it away to local you

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,870
know moms it's like this is really

00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,150
amazing stuff that they do and they've

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,259
been able to turn into impact on the

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,759
organization

00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,529
you know like a lot of open-source

00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,160
organizations they've got about a 1 to

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,660
10 ratio of paid staff to volunteers and

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,729
they have a huge well-oiled machine to

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,919
keep the volunteer pipeline full because

00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,989
that's a you know it's if they went down

00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,789
to 200 paid staff and no volunteers this

00:12:54,989 --> 00:13:00,209
whole thing would fall apart

00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:02,489
they do like yearly conferences the

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:05,309
whole deal and the thing is is like

00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:09,419
despite all the work to make it work

00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:13,559
it means pressure and looming above that

00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:16,350
all there's this big mission you know

00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,839
this purpose that drives us all and I I

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,729
watched friends and co-workers and

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,609
colleagues and loved ones in that

00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:27,569
environment go through the cycles of

00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:29,459
burnout and and stress and feeling like

00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:31,499
they were betraying people that cared

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,839
for by stepping back and taking a

00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:36,119
breather I mean forget forget power the

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,579
web-like power 4 percent of the web

00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:43,589
verses literally keep people from going

00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:45,929
to hell like I mean there's a mission

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:49,109
you're gonna step back from it's tricky

00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:51,720
and the thing is is like the the

00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:53,069
reductionist horror show end point of

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,539
that is like if you don't help set up

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:56,009
chairs before the meeting you hate Jesus

00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:59,459
like that's just

00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,809
end of story you're gonna have to live

00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,319
with you want to live with that okay so

00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:06,359
our sittin up chairs and but it even it

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,309
best though even without that kind of

00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:09,720
you know half jokey you know but not

00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:12,239
really jokey we need to do we need to

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,879
set up chairs kind of thing like it can

00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:18,689
be a lot of huge source of self-imposed

00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,399
guilt and at worst it can be really

00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:23,279
deliberately exploited by people higher

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,619
up the food chain who are part of the

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,109
big machine that is running and say well

00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:29,699
you know what we need 10,000 volunteers

00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:31,259
you know I you know okay well I'm really

00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:32,939
glad he wants to go to soccer for his

00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:37,259
kid but you know like we need to keep

00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:39,689
need to keep the gears turning and the

00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:44,489
thing I find really weird is that this

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:47,399
is super predictable to like it happens

00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:49,139
not just in churches it doesn't happen

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,749
just in open-source organizations

00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,490
it's an activism it's in politics it's

00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:55,890
in religious groups it's in

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,240
startups this happens in community

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:02,880
theater groups it's it's huge

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,860
and so there's book war is a force that

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,770
gives us meaning written by Christopher

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:11,760
hedges it's about the idea that in

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:14,550
wartime people endure all sorts of

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,649
terrible hardship but afterwards so many

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,020
of them even coming out traumatized and

00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,600
in dire straits come out with this

00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:25,520
feeling of lostness afterwards because

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,800
it it was the big thing

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,260
everything was writ large at that moment

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,690
everything was immediate and intense and

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,180
it was part of this huge world altering

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,950
experience you know it might have been

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:44,100
terrible for me personally but I you

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:46,320
know it was the big thing and the big

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,760
cause is often what Stokes people's

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:54,660
passion for conflict too and it's I mean

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:57,930
I apologize if I offend anyone but like

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,820
it's it's heartbreaking because

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:03,750
I've seen a lot of people that I love

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,880
and I care for get fried on this and the

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,970
common factor is this purpose that is

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,339
bigger than us a thing bigger than

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,560
everyday life bigger than any of us as

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,329
individuals it can inspire us and it can

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,390
motivate us and it can encourage us when

00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:19,980
the hours are long and the odds are long

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:23,130
but it can also chew us up and turn us

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,959
against each other too and like some of

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,290
the professions that are most at risk

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,380
for burnout coincidentally are like

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:34,020
social workers doctors teachers nurses

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,480
they're people who the work that they do

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,190
saves lives and it changes people's

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,399
lives for the better and it matters

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,620
howdy how do you justify going home and

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,430
relaxing when like literally someone

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:51,930
could die if you do that that's a tough

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,940
burden to bear and that idea of caring

00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,680
for people and caring for a cause and

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,880
caring for something bigger than just my

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,190
own interest in my own comfort is so

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,900
powerful and so dangerous if it's not

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,040
approached very carefully it can make

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,809
stepping back and taking care of

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,720
ourselves really difficult

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,669
and the worst part is is again it's like

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,429
with you know like with saving lives if

00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:17,909
you're a doctor the cause often does

00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:20,129
matter I mean it often is more important

00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:22,259
than making delivering fast food 15

00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:24,360
seconds faster in the Bay Area it's

00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,299
often things like you know improving

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,860
city services or you know making it

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,480
easier for people to get educational

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,759
opportunities or you know all kinds of

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,830
stuff like that and you know in that

00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,749
kind of situation like how can I stop

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,090
saving lives just to take a vacation how

00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:40,769
can I stop fixing bugs just because like

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,369
I I want to spend some time with my wife

00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:47,999
or how can I stop when the team is

00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:50,190
depending on me even forget the deadline

00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:51,779
it's just my the people that I work with

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,879
day in and day out they'll have to carry

00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,440
the burden if I step back and that just

00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:59,549
makes it harder for them so I guess

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,590
we're just in it all together the thing

00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:03,539
is is like even assuming that we are

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,320
literally saving lives the truth is that

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:09,960
taking care of ourselves matters just as

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,519
much as taking care of other people it's

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,779
always a tricky balance trying to figure

00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,809
out how to articulate this without

00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:19,379
saying yes greed is good or something

00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,730
like that but I mean I hope that it's

00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:27,269
clear that that's not what I'm getting

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:31,399
at what I mean is that well if a cause

00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:35,360
can't live without you suffering for it

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:39,450
then that cause may just deserve to die

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,960
it may not be a bad goal but like it

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:47,340
just you know you are not consumable

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:50,700
fuel and the more time I've spent in

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,740
like missional organizations like you

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,929
know that you know you know religious

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,700
nonprofits open source you know

00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:58,080
political movement stuff like that the

00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,820
more and more I've been convinced this

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,039
is true like if a project or

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,230
organization can't live without chewing

00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:08,519
you up eventually you will burn out and

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,799
then if it really can't live without you

00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,159
the project will collapse anyways so

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,740
unless you believe you are literally

00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:20,250
immortal and possess an infinite supply

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,870
of Red Bull it is unsustainable all

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,950
you are doing is kicking the can down

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:27,870
the road so like don't feel guilty about

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,070
hitting that point where you say hold on

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,570
I've got to step back I've got to

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,780
breathe I've got to do this because it's

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,610
going to come it the only difference is

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,950
whether you will be in a position to

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:42,780
step back and breathe or whether they'll

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:45,540
be wheeling you out and so okay so I'm I

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,440
think I'm running along here just stage

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:51,360
hook me at any point so how do we break

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,890
this cycle like you know when we talk

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,600
about organizational dynamics and we

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,540
talk about like okay so what can we do

00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,820
about this how do we like put out this

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,930
giant hellish tire fire of mutual like

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,060
obligation and guilt and you know

00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,380
pressure and like I mean like a lot of

00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,360
things it's got to be done one bit at a

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,830
time and we do it with the people that

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,250
are right around us it's not like a

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:17,430
giant you know a giant writ large thing

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,620
we do for everyone simultaneously I mean

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,000
and so I think about it in terms of like

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,090
my own teams and the groups that I work

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,450
with directly one is we don't talk we

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,060
can't glorify death marches when I was

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,470
like a super you know young puppet you

00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,180
know and got my first job at like a

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,040
dot-com consultancy I thought it was so

00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,440
awesome that people slept under their

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,410
desks and you got private office with a

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,080
futon so you could just like stock up

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,210
like pop-tarts from the company kitchen

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,290
and you could just cruise now I'm like

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,440
that is the worst thing in the world

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:54,450
because it is passion quote-unquote

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:59,280
covering up bad planning understaffing

00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:02,210
burnout poor resourcing and terrible

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,370
expectations and saying yeah who

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:08,000
streetfighters does not make that a

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:11,850
healthy dynamic

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,760
don't punish boundaries when people

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,350
exercise them I think like a friend of

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,120
mine and I were working on we're in the

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,440
core in crunch time for a book we were

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,170
call writing which was actually the

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,660
first edition of using Drupal and during

00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,740
one of the deadline pushes like one of

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,330
the other three one of the other

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,070
co-authors took a break to go see a

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:33,909
movie with his girlfriend and a friend

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,250
she turned to me it's like this

00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:38,880
I resent my friend for going on a date

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,010
with his girlfriend like this is

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,020
something has clearly broken here but

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,409
like that's a natural impulse when that

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,570
kind of pressure is on and it takes

00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:50,799
cautiously assessing not just what's

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,730
going on with other people but our own

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,610
reactions

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:57,039
it's like okay I'm still in it and this

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,110
person just tagged out I can't treat

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,750
them like crap because they took that

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:05,080
breather another one is like giving

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:08,230
gentle nudges to workaholics on the team

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,570
because like those like 110 percent

00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,760
people the ones that like oh if they

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,960
realize the ticking isn't done you don't

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,610
even have to tell them they will be

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,440
there this weekend and then you come in

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:24,330
on Monday and they're like yeah it

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:30,059
shipped you know it's like how much

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:30,059
adderall has gone into this ticket

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:35,440
because it's easy to take them for

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:38,140
granted because the impact is never on

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,730
time lines it's never on budgets when

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,100
those people are doing that it's on them

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,840
it's on / it's on their bodies it's on

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,610
their psychological health it's on their

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,520
relationships with the people they care

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:51,490
about and their families that's what's

00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,700
being used in order to deliver that

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,950
ticket on time and we need to talk to

00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:00,220
them both to make sure that they are

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,940
okay stepping back and breathing but

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,590
also to make sure that a culture of

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,539
expectation doesn't emerge for all of

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,250
the other people on the team other

00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:11,470
people shouldn't have to feel like they

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,950
can keep they need to figure out I keep

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:18,149
up with that and I think I'll keep it

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,770
real short but like a co-worker of mine

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:22,570
III was responsible for estimating a

00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,130
couple of tasks for a client he came in

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,520
and was responsible for implementing

00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:30,039
them I bet you can see where this goes

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,779
and I I screwed up the estimate I didn't

00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,279
spot a couple of key bits that were you

00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,260
know a part of it and it ended up taking

00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,970
like 40 hours instead of 20 hours in the

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,149
grand scheme of things this is not like

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,039
world-altering but on Friday was when we

00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:43,840
realized you know okay we're gonna have

00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,760
to punt this back for more time I came

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:53,809
in on Monday checked in he's like okay

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:56,090
did it it's like and well it sounds like

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,679
okay one congratulations it appears to

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:02,809
work and you did not hallucinate that

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:06,470
check-in but two like I screwed up

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:08,410
I miss estimated something that means I

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,760
need to go to them and tell them I

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,980
didn't estimate something correctly and

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,280
we're gonna need more time that's on me

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,740
that's not on you to burn yourself up to

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,520
go make my bad estimate a true estimate

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,380
and it was like you know they liked the

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,850
sound like you see a dog sort of like

00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,290
tilt its head and here's something in

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,240
the distance it was it was almost like

00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:35,240
this is just like genuine confusion it's

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,950
like okay and I mean it's so I've always

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,530
thought back to that as like how easy it

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:42,500
is in those moments for the 100 percent

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:44,360
110 percent people to feel like all okay

00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,590
this is what I got to do it's like you

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,410
need to make it clear that that's not

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,120
like part of the assumption and if

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,210
you're currently someone who's in charge

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:56,990
of a business or a group or an

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:59,510
organization like this if your

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:03,620
organization needs to squeeze people dry

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:07,340
to function if it falls apart when like

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,960
everyone isn't into 110 percent zone the

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,540
problem is not that your team is

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,790
insufficiently passionate the problem is

00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:17,570
not that the people working for you are

00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:20,480
not dedicated enough to this grand

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,660
vision that we share the problem is that

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,549
you need a business model that works I

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:29,450
mean I I don't mean to sound harsh with

00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:31,790
that but like it's very easy to get

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,990
sucked into that cycle and especially

00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,910
for those of us who've been a part of

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,559
like small things that started and we

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,260
were the one we want to help take it off

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,570
it's so personal and it's so intense and

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,390
it matters so much and we want everyone

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:47,330
to have that sort of life consuming

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,340
passion about it and that can often mask

00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,929
the fact that we just gotta figure out a

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,059
better way to do it

00:25:50,929 --> 00:26:00,260
so that these people don't get killed by

00:25:53,059 --> 00:26:03,680
it another one and imagine

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,960
a friend that you really care about like

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,760
literally right now just think somebody

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,080
that you know that sometimes comes to

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,490
you and talk to you about like troubles

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,350
that they're having or like what's going

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,790
on or something they're happy about that

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,880
you really care for and you've known for

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:21,230
a while and think what you would say to

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:26,210
that if they came to you and described

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:29,120
the kind of guilt you're you sometimes

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,910
face about making those choices if they

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,350
came to you and said man I I feel like I

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,630
I really need to just take a breather

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,220
because I'm totally fried but if I don't

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,810
you know man

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:46,090
nobody's nobody's gonna get dropdowns

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:51,800
working on Android I would say to them

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:54,620
no no you you matter more than that go

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,980
recharge and I found that idea of

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,590
thinking about someone I care about and

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,230
asking how I would tell them what that

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,280
what I would tell them to do if they

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,560
experienced what I was experiencing that

00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,560
helps a lot another one is recharging

00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,840
outside the team like it's very easy

00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,550
especially in like a tech industry that

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,850
really values the idea of like building

00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:19,160
like campus experiences or like hobby

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,560
open source contributors who are also

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,270
professional open source contributors in

00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,490
in their sleep dream about open source

00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,290
contribution you know and then and

00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,420
recreationally we get together at the

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:32,770
local board have open source meetups and

00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:35,720
like it's very easy for to

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:39,580
unintentionally build a personal support

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,820
system that is 100 and 100 percent other

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:46,340
people in the same zone and one of the

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,830
challenges is that it's very hard to get

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,600
reality checks on whether you're in a

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,360
healthy place if everybody else is in

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,160
the same unhealthy place and it also

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,000
means that when you have to take those

00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,260
seasons of stepping back and recharging

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,230
suddenly you find yourself cut off from

00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:06,590
your entire personal support system

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:08,300
because everybody you know is over there

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,920
doing that thing that you had to step

00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,560
back from because who is killing you

00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,060
that's really difficult so like figuring

00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,950
out ways to recharge

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,740
and build energy that aren't just the

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:20,960
same thing is a big part of it and

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,910
finally like you know I think this comes

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,970
up a lot in like self-care and and and

00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:29,210
personal care stuff put on your own mask

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,610
first like the the coral principle of

00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:34,700
like you know airplane crash

00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,350
you know instructions it's do not be so

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,420
concerned about helping the person next

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,260
to you that you don't put on your air

00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:45,440
mask and then both of you pass out

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:49,100
because if you can't help people because

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,010
you're fried well that's still not

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:55,700
helping people like taking care of

00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:58,970
yourself allows you to come back for

00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:02,180
another season renewed and refreshed if

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:11,450
that's what you care about like it

00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:13,310
matters because the world this world the

00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:17,690
one that we want to go change and have

00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:24,740
an impact on is a better place for your

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:30,080
presence in it and your contribution to

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:35,330
the world is more than what you do and

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:39,470
what you make you are more than the

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:42,080
output that you generate and you matter

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:45,430
more than the mission that you have

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:50,840
dedicated yourself to you are worth

00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:53,690
taking care of yourself and you as a

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,470
healthy and whole person are a net

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:59,000
positive for the world even if dropdown

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:03,640
still don't work on Android devices

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,860
older than I think KitKat that's it

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,940
that's all I got you matter more than

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,059
the clock

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,059
[Music]

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:26,730
I think I went overtime Oh excellent

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:30,769
I just kept everyone from getting

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,769
