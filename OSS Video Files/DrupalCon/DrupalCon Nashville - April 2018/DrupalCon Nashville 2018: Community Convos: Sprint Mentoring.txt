This conversation will include an overview of what each of the Mentoring Leads does to prepare for the Friday sprints as well as pointers to key resources used and how you can scale these efforts to run a sprint or continue contributing after DrupalCon. 

There will be time for a few questions. Experienced and new mentors and contributors are welcome! There's a way to contribute to Drupal for everyone no matter your previous experience. For active mentoring and contribution time please check out the sprints page.
