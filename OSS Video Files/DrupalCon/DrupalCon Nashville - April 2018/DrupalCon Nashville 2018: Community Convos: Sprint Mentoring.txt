I'm part of the Drupal diversity

inclusion initiative and actually I've

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,820
been kind of I guess I'm a mentee I've

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,950
been mentored and that initiative has

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,200
been fun I've learned a lot of stuff so

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,150
if anybody wants to help out with the

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,550

drupal.org and clean Clarkson on Twitter

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,190
I'm Fatima I first mentored a dribble

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,800
con Vienna which was the Drupal con

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,390
before this one so if I can do it and I

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,900
am especially this year so if I can do

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,239
it so can you

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,800
um and we're looking for mentors to help

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,200
us on Friday so this I know to be a

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,750
mentor and also on the leadership team

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,489
for Drupal diversity and inclusion that

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,530
stuff is really important to me so come

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,760
to the GDI booth and talk about it or

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,329
help clean with the web site

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,419
an amazing job sorry I'm bad with time

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:26,160
zone no worries I had to adjust my

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:27,780
calendar a lot okay so this is most of

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,289
the mentoring team from Vienna and do

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,660
believe just a few quick notes on

00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,800
mentoring generally I suspect many of

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,050
you are already familiar with the

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,610
program but mentoring really helps

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,400
everyone involved from the mentees

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,199
obviously who learned and pair up with

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,690
mentors but also when you're mentoring

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,130
you learn so much because you're being

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,039
asked all these questions that maybe you

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:53,190
didn't think about before and it really

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,630
cascades from there so just becomes

00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:01,260
bigger and bigger until you have this

00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:05,280
whole Drupal community so here we are so

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:08,250
very brief history of mentoring we kind

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,389
of started in 2012 when xjm suggested a

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,970
core office day at DC Denver and she

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,789
said that there was this really magical

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,039
moment during the day when the mentees

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,780
started becoming mentors and were

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,039
helping each other so there was less and

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:29,160
less work for the original team of

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:32,180
mentors to do as the day went on I think

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:38,820
that that's really key to mentoring and

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:41,280
being mentoring experience is that we're

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,720
always progressing it's not a singular

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,990
relationship you know we're always

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:51,050
progressing and learning from each other

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:54,479
and just reading what X Jim had wrote in

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,220
2012 well I mean we keep saying the same

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:05,039
thing so it's I have to keep reminding

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:07,080
myself that that's so a lot of our time

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,030
and effort is spent organizing things at

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,680
Drupal cons so the Sprint's for Friday

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,530
and the events during the week to

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,810
familiarize everyone with the tasks that

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,919
we will be working on we do get some

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,090
assistance from the Drupal Association

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:23,250
to get our tools out to the world and

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:27,169
there are a few very helpful mentors who

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,840
keep office hours online as well so

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,819
a few people have been putting in a lot

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,069
of extra effort in the last few years

00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:35,930
especially including Rachel Norfolk

00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:40,129
who's not Rachel Norfolk Rachel Lawson

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:42,560
who's not here right now but she's been

00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:45,289
going to a lot of the events in Europe

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,319
and keeping up that end of things so

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:51,099
would like to move on to Drupal

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:56,509
diversity and inclusion and this project

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:57,979
cetera so I am part of the same Drupal

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,889
diversity inclusion group I'm on the

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,999
leadership team of that as well and a

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:06,650
few like 9 months ago juries released a

00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,999
blog post talking about where code

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,310
contributions come from how they're

00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:12,919
supported and there's like one line that

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:16,430
said 2.3 percent of contributions are

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:20,210
from women we think there was no other

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,800
diversity talk or data and it generated

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,800
a lot of discussion among our group

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,240
about what can be done and some of that

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,770
is out of our hands maybe we can't

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
necessarily change the way that data is

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,650
collected or what types of data are

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,319
collected I think we might be able to

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:38,449
but we just kind of with a great burst

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,199
of energy founded something called the

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:45,229
DDI contributing and in the past nine

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,810
months we've been kind of figuring out

00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:50,029
what we do why we do it and our focus

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,500
really is trying to address barriers

00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,919
specific to people from underrepresented

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,360
and marginalized groups and one of the

00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,310
things that I think DDI can't rip team

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,180
specifically is looking at is the fact

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,399
that triple con is expensive and as much

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,800
as like the mentoring experience a

00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,080
triple con has improved my life and the

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,710
lives of many others it's it's hard to

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,560
get to can be intimidating so that's one

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,180
strategy we're doing um and we're still

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,759
figuring it out we're so excited to be

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,439
part of this group and I don't know if

00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:27,110
clean were thought to my want to talk as

00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:30,020
well so far I you know I just happened

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:34,519
to if you're not on slack actually get

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:36,200
on the Drupal slack because how to use

00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,959
IRC really

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,190
like go to this IRC it's like wait what

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,909
is this thing it's been around since

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,320
before the internet but just I never

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,149
could connect with anyone on earth I

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,680
mean so when you know when slack

00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:51,709
happened it made it a lot easier and I

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,410
just saw this diversity inclusion room

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:56,360
and I went in there and myself and my

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,100
wife do a lot of consulting and

00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,750
diversity and I just kind of saw a lot

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,120
of the things that were happening in

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,240
that room and I just felt like you know

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,699
I I needed to be a part of it and you

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,410
know we decided to do this website and I

00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,480
was like oh I guess I'll help with that

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,360
I know a little bit about some things

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,670
and you know it's been a really cool

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,180
experience I you know my personal job I

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,410
am I have I'm a one-person show you know

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,670
so I don't I'm not around a lot of

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,370
Drupal developers so I don't get to

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,139
speak to people and learn things and you

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,790
know we put together all these issue

00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,440
queues I'm like what we have to do and

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,510
someone volunteer to be a project

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,860
manager and I've never worked with the

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,170
project manager before and it was

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,899
awesome like somebody somebody tells you

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,910
what to do right there's a list of

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,890
things that you're supposed to do and

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,570
then they tell you how to do a write

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,850
down like what needs to be done and like

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,459
you know the color codes like everything

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,430
was so clean his name is Alex Alex we

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,339
miss you I wish you were here but for me

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,320
that that was like a learning experience

00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,449
that I didn't expect to get out of it

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,100
and now puts me in a better position

00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:02,870
than maybe you know if I were to leave

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,180
and go somewhere else and get it apply

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,880
for another job I can maybe use some of

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,320
that experience to help me so you know

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,120
get involved as much as you can and

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,500
that's that's pretty much it I have a

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,470
question actually how can we get

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,149
involved in the DDI contributing what's

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,550
the you know other than joining Drupal

00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:24,800
slack and going to that channel you know

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:28,120
what are the next steps for me as a

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,120
developer or mentor

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:35,329
has a project it's like called DDI screw

00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:37,249
trip and explaining there is an issue

00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,019
queue if here are the things that we

00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:41,149
need to do for the website and there's

00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:43,519
also meetings every week or bi-weekly

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,600
actually twice a weekend once a month so

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,730
we have a lot of meetings why so we can

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:53,269
once a month where the team pairs up

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:54,529
mentor-mentee and we have a couple

00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,269
different teams we have like the site

00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,279
team that's working on our site that

00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,139
does they did a bunch of front-end work

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,430
which is super exciting we have a

00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,170
back-end team that's kind of been doing

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,410
some testing and supporting people

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:09,949
through testing issues testing learning

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,689
so we have lots of meetings I have cards

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,269
for the diversity inclusion team in

00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:15,499
general so you can help and then pop in

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:16,970
the channel there's not that many I try

00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:19,759
to say hi to everybody

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:37,009
and I will say hi to you and I'm also

00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:39,290
here a week yeah things like people not

00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:44,540
knowing how to put a comment on an issue

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:47,629
right yeah all kinds of stuff cool great

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,100
thank you so next we're just gonna go

00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,899
into a little nitty-gritty on what

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,879
exactly it takes to run at the Friday

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:58,399
sprints and it takes the entire team

00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,199
there's a lot of work to do we honestly

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,389
deleted a lot of bullet points because

00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:03,949
it was ridiculous but you get the idea

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:08,749
you can just ignore them for now but

00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:15,370
there's a lot to do moving right along

00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:15,370
we have the mentoring lead coordinator

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,399
okay so this time I'm one of the mentor

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:28,329
leads and this is kind of funny because

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,459
when I started like I barely knew Drupal

00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:33,279
I went to my fish DrupalCon with very

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,320
little experience and I you know was

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,529
mentored by others I learn a couple of

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,630
things and I made some friends the next

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:42,700
year I decided that I wanted to be part

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,410
of that and all of the sudden they bring

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,880
me on all onboard and they give me all

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:51,220
these responsibilities that I was like

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:54,610
what but that helped me a lot like to

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,160
improve to to get new skills that I

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:02,740
didn't have before even like speaking at

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:04,899
a mic I was very shy before but like to

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,420
be honest like being a mentor lead

00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,620
coordinator or any lead position is

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,339
really easy

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,529
in short you are mentor of mentors and

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,630
basically what you have to do is come on

00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,490
come to an online meeting once a month

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,740
to prepare for DrupalCon

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,839
there is of course a lot of work in

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,910
between the meetings but it's just like

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,820
if you have the time and you have the

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,769
like the willingness to do it it's like

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,720
anyone can do it and we're always open

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,440
to new people to come on board because

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,640
we need it we need help

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,070
thank you

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:43,120
next we have mentor communications lead

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:46,360
which is me so for this we put out a few

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,329
emails leading up to Drupal con with you

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,040
know sign up get involved put yourself

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:54,310
on a spread sheet and there's also of

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,930
course the Twitter account same thing

00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,220
just mostly announcing events and

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,230
keeping people in touch so that's

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,940
honestly really straightforward but

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,870
important to keep people involved

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,870
throughout the year

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:18,550
buthe lead jordana basically kind of

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,650
just set up the booth make sure that

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,170
there's somebody there to instruct

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,000
people help people out how they figure

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,350
out what Sprint's are sometimes as well

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,510
and I kind of also wanted to say it's

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,370
not expected for you to know everything

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,530
no one knows everything there's been

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,450
many times I'm like well what am I

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,720
supposed to do and they will everybody

00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,400
will be just bitching help it's and

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,470
you'll figure it out together right so

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,900
this is it's it's it seems daunting it's

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,270
really not you know we'll figure it out

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,520
together that's kind of what mentoring

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,680
is that is completely true as you can

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,010
see we're figuring this out together

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,010
right now

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:06,250
not as issue triage Benji so I've talked

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,530
first aid to Boy Scouts so I have very

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:12,580
specific ideas about what triage mean

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:14,380
and I prefer the term curation we want

00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,650
all the issues we can get that are

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,260
suitable for novices to work on at the

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:23,290
sprint and this takes a fair amount of

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:26,260
time going through issues you can just

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,230
click on a link and find a list of

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,630
issues tagged with novice tagged but

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,640
they're not all up to date so we have to

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,310
go through them figure out which ones

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,860
are still suitable for novices to work

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,470
on make sure that there's information

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,910
and the issue summary so that a novice

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,180
can look at it quickly and figure out

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,580
what needs to be done so I've started a

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,180
little spreadsheet we'll work on it at

00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:54,370
the session tomorrow at one o'clock and

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,710
I might have a few things I've noticed

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:00,520
that need to be fixed that I haven't

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,320
created issues for because one thing

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,030
that tends to happen is that after you

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,710
put a lot of work into curating the

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,100
novice issues people around the world

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,860
steal them and I want them to be there

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,290
for us on a Friday if we're going to

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:20,710
spend this much work into curating them

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:22,990
I want to make sure we can use them one

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,030
comment about the word noise in itself

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,560
sometimes it implies that it is

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:31,900
something like minor or trivial or value

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,540
but that is not the case at all I have

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,430
seen noise critical issues the word

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,530
noise in this context just means there

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,020
is something actionable to do and you

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,660
can do like without spending a whole day

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,680
to figure out what are the next steps

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:49,140
basically I know it's issue is something

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:52,420
that you can start working right away oh

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,280
and one more thing as long as there's a

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,710
mentor present I think we can stretch

00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,450
the usual meaning of what is a novice

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,460
issue and if you're planning to mentor

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,770
on Friday and you have some issues that

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,320
you know what needs to be done next and

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:19,180
you can help someone do that that counts

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:22,510
as a novice issue and we can use that so

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,640
something that came up several times

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,110
over the years was a novice issue

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,510
sometimes it's more about getting to

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,730
know the issue queue and less about the

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,740
kind of challenge presented by the item

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,130
so very experienced contributors might

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,200
be fixing a typo and just getting it all

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,090
the way through the process is actually

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,100
a there's a sense of accomplishment and

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,250
it's not terribly straightforward so

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,650
it's worth also picking novice issues

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,160
that they're actionable right away but

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:54,790
perhaps they let people focus on the

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,420
kind of process rather than you know the

00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,550
technical challenge thing on the other

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,680
side we have major issue triage which is

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,970
somewhat different for the major issue

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,770
triage and this is what happens when

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,450
people find an issue and think it's

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,830
major and then tag it as major and then

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,140
there's a bunch of major issues in the

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,000
queue and so what our job is to

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,890
basically look at all the major issues

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,389
go through them make sure they're still

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,159
major maybe test

00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,679
maybe upload some more updates to the

00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,029
ticket if it's really old we have a flow

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,149
chart that kind of helps you through

00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:32,219
this process really it's about helping

00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,219
to clean up the issue queues basically

00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:46,659
just like that it's easy yes

00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,089
so this is the first time sprinter

00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,579
workshop in which we will teach new

00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:53,079
contributors exactly how to set up their

00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:56,379
tools on their personal computer or

00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,239
share machines and I think there's been

00:18:56,379 --> 00:19:01,029
a lot of work put in recently on some

00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:07,269
new tools so we're gonna be using those

00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:09,700
on Friday it's very exciting it's the

00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,320
first time purchase workshop is to make

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,869
it a great experience for first-time

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,249
sprinters you know they come we give

00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:16,869
them the tools we set them up we let

00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:19,149
them work on an you know an easy issue

00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:21,159
and to have them be successful leads

00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:23,729
them to be contributors going forward so

00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,739
that's critical to what we're doing

00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:31,320
awesome and then we have the core

00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:31,320
mentored sprint room lead gel

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,339
[Music]

00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,919
I've never been in this position before

00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:43,629
so I get to try it for the first time

00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:45,909
but I like on previous I usually hang

00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:47,529
out in the mentor sprints and jump

00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:49,419
between tables and it's kind of similar

00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:50,950
but I would be kind of helping out the

00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,679
other mentors in that in that room

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,829
making sure that they get what they need

00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:04,179
and can find who they need to help their

00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:06,639
mentees mentor so we're probably gonna

00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:09,429
have since it's a big job and you have

00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:12,690
two rooms so I'll probably be in the the

00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,690
first time workshop

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,360
room and just being able to coordinate

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:22,740
with Mauricio too to make sure we're you

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,050
know finding the issues we're seeing if

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,620
if what you know what we can do to help

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:33,040
mentors and the tables and contributors

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:37,780
move issues along so we can get that

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:40,660
accomplishable tasks so we are moving

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,990
forward with some plans for the future

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:47,500
we've been doing a lot of retrospective

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:51,910
contemplating lately and I think we have

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,980
a buff coming up on Thursday yeah last

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,050
session on Thursday so definitely stick

00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:00,160
around for that join a longer

00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:08,410
conversation should be good we have a

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:10,510
lot of planning to do basically and that

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:19,210
will be on Friday yeah so we will have a

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:21,700
live commit Friday hopefully it'll be

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,000
fine everything comes together in the

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:28,900
end

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,360
so that's I think most of it yeah one

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,380
thing that I want to add and something

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,650
that is really useful for me in many

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,990
ways

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,450
I'm from Nicaragua traveling to a

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,310
conference is a little bit harder than

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,950
from people from the States

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:48,220
one thing that the mentoring team does

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:51,550
at Drupa con is that the Association

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,950
gives us eight tickets to distribute to

00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,620
mentors so if you want to be a mentor

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,590
and you cannot come to Drupal con

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,750
because it is too expensive at least we

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,990
can provide a ticket there are only

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:07,690
eight slots per Drupal con so and

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,730
usually more than eight people apply so

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:15,190
there is a selection process there that

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:17,830
needs to happen but that's one one way

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,650
that you can make Drupal more affordable

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,000
so if you would like to participate or

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,830
you know someone who would like to

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,360
participate but cannot make it without

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,370
this type of support

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:34,680
we can provide those mentor tickets to

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,820
those that need it thank you so this is

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,370
just a few of the things we've been

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,850
working on most recently just a few

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,230
highlights from the last year

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:47,490
lots of work from lots of different

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,530
amazing people there and we do have one

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,450
minute left

00:22:48,530 --> 00:23:02,130
does anyone have a question or an extra

00:22:51,450 --> 00:23:12,480
point Michael I just want to thank you

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,100

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:43,470
[Music]

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,830
depending on the time shift or three or

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:49,830

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:56,310

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:58,260
