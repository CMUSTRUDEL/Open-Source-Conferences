Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Stop Speaking Lorem Ipsum
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	In over 7 years of web project work, wearing hats of every shade and color, one issue has plagued almost (if not every) project I've been a part of: miscommunication. It happens with clients. It happens internally. As I grew in my career and took on more of a client-facing and leadership role, I started to understand the pattern—everyone had a different technical background, and therefore a different technical vocabulary! From different CMS platforms calling the same things by a different name (content types? post types? templates?!), to clients and agencies developing their own terms or shorthand for things (mocks, wires, templates!), my project teams were often not speaking the same language, with the clients or with each other. And it led to late nights and long weekends making adjustments no one knew were needed because we'd all thought we'd been clear.

In order to combat this nightmarish, yet avoidable situation, I've gone back to my content, UX and even elementary teacher roots and developed a list of key concepts that often leave teams frustrated in the 11th hour when they suddenly realize they've been talking apples to someone expecting oranges. I've outlined a few different types of approaches to getting on the same page with your project team (clients/stakeholders included) from the very beginning.

This session is for anyone working on a web project who wants to improve understanding through shared language (no prior management or other web experience required). Attendees will walk away with some tips and tricks for ensuring they are able to avoid aggravating miscommunications that are better suited to RomComs than the workplace.

so this is stop speaking lorem ipsum how

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,710
to improve project communications

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,360
through vocabulary building and I am

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,400
Samantha Shriver some of you may know me

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,969
as Sam Elliott I'm a solutions

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,010
consultant @ ffw and over the course of

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,740
my career with Drupal it's been a little

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,560
over seven years now one of the things I

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,570
realized was ricard was a recurring

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,750
issue amongst a variety of my projects

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,640
no matter what role I was playing or how

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,040
I was relating to my peers or my clients

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,000
there was basically this elephant in the

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,840
room this unspoken unspoken but bursty

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,579
issue that cropped up time and time

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,739
again and actually very long a

00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,899
Australian spiritual master wrote about

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,329
this topic in his book knowing yourself

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,010
the true and the false when he said we

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,110
can rarely see things from the point of

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,789
view of another person because we look

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,190
at the facts through the screen of an

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,149
impression or an interest which distorts

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,530
our view and then there are accusations

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,330
quarrels and misunderstandings

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,310
now this quote is important to me

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,610
because there's two key points here that

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,110
brought me to this stage here today two

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,619
reasons why I thought this was important

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,900
to talk about one is that from a very

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,720
small age when we start understanding

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,119
who we are as people we realize that

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,200
others are different than us people have

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,869
different experiences and different

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,990
perspectives but somewhere along the way

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,970
we tend to forget that I personally

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,610
forget that all the time

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,310
and what this does is lead to conflict

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,520
we see it all the time in our personal

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,100
lives our professional lives and I would

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,189
like to stop the vicious cycle so that's

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,020
what we're talking about today but first

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,130
story time so if you don't mind bearing

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,570
with me a little bit put on your

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,680
imagination cap so we're gonna go back

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,780
in time to 2011 I am a team lead working

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,610
with my development manager and we have

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,520
joined a meeting with our stakeholders

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,009
to talk about the project of this the

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,930
status of the project because they're a

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,420
little bit nervous since we convinced

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,240
him to switch from an unnamed terrible

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,820
CMS to Drupal 7

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,500
and we've lost some time there was some

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,020
development work put into this other

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,460
system that shall not be named and we're

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,250
trying to gain back that ground so

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,320
they've asked us very directly to give

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,720
them a status update how's the project

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,370
going so the development manager is

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,570
sitting right here to my right he says

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,460
with a very calm but proud grin weird we

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,670
actually have some really good news the

00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,620
templates are almost complete now across

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,030
from me kind of where you guys are

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,970
sitting is the director of

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,490
communications and her face lights up

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,610
like it is Christmas morning and she's

00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,610
got a giant stack of presents she is

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,680
ecstatic to my left is the web project

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,950
manager on the client side and she looks

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,800
a little confused and maybe perplexed

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,470
about this news now I want you all to

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,620
imagine again maybe close your eyes if

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,200
you must and picture what you think of

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:14,560
when you hear the phrase the templates

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:18,710
are almost complete what did you picture

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,390
did you picture code in TPL files coming

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,400
together very nicely on the back end

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:26,090
because you have a development focused

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,130
mind and you're picturing TP LS did you

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,290
picture wireframes and the thought that

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,120
the templates or page layouts are

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,710
starting to come together in sketch form

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,680
and we're starting to establish these

00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:39,310
patterns and they're almost complete or

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,440
did you to use a southern turn of phrase

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,960
picture the whole hog and you went

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,570
straight to the designs are complete the

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,160
whole page layouts are done and we're

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,900
raring to go now ultimately no offense

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,900
it doesn't really matter what you

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,060
pictured because my point is that it is

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,820
very unlikely we all picture the same

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,990
thing now I'm not going to leave the

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,490
story there because I don't want you

00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,930
guys to go back to your hotels tossing

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:11,630
and turning wondering what happened in

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:13,610
2011 so let me continue the development

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,050
manager to my right had just come off of

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,290
a scrum meeting with me and our

00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:21,770
developers and he was referencing the

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,139
TPS our development team had very very

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,090
proudly figured out a way to

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:30,129
move the development forward even though

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,590
our designs were not yet complete the

00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:36,830
communications director our team here

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,150
has had lit up so brightly because she

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,430
thought we were about to deliver her a

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,259
stack of completed designs that were way

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,490
ahead of schedule because she was

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,810
thinking the templates are almost

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,300
complete means she's getting all these

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,590
design files and the web manager who'd

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,419
been reviewing and approving our

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,879
wireframes before they went on to the

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,680
communications director in the form of

00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,259
designs was very confused because she

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,759
knew she hadn't seen any designs yet she

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,979
had only been looking at wireframes and

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,250
and what were we talking about with the

00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:08,150
templates being complete and that's just

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,789
one simple area in which having a lack

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,810
of a common shared vocabulary can cause

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:15,620
problems

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,389
there are many technical web related I

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,939
don't know what I'm doing

00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:22,580
web related jargon that can come into

00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:24,289
play when you're talking about shared

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,310
vocabulary in terms that can be tricky

00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:31,250
things like wireframes or content types

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,110
or taxonomy x' can be sticky I don't

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,629
know how many times I have explained the

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,659
concept of a sitemap to a client or to a

00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:40,399
non web person I don't know how many

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,779
it's been to many there's a lot of times

00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,539
I've explained the concept it never

00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:46,129
really sinks in and that's just at the

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:48,500
jargon level and I think all of us can

00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,779
kind of understand why non web

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,520
professionals or others could have a

00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,710
challenge understanding some of these

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,909
web concepts it makes sense to us we

00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,250
need to spend a little more time digging

00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:00,080
into these things but I think what a lot

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,779
of people skip if they even get to that

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,879
level is going a little bit deeper to

00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,969
the project process and how we're

00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:12,919
talking about doing project work things

00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:16,460
like agile or MVP or requirement and

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:18,439
deadlines these concepts seem so

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,729
straightforward to us and maybe even

00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,719
you'll spend some time on things like

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:25,819
agile and an MVP but I would bet money

00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:27,939
people have not spent time talking about

00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:31,699
the concept of a deadline it seems

00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:34,639
straightforward but how many times have

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:36,649
you given someone a deadline only to

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,550
have them come to you because they

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,410
worked right up

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,100
until that deadline before they finished

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,630
their part of the work and then you're

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,600
stuck saying wait a minute

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,730
did anyone else review this has it been

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,280
code reviewed has a peer reviewed it has

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,410
it been edited copy edited is it ready

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,970
to go so if you're understanding of what

00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,830
that deadline means is different than

00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,690
the person who's receiving the deadline

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,570
you're going to have conflict you're

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,800
going to run into trouble alright so we

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,080
know that we need to focus on

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,940
terminology and coming to a common

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,670
understanding it's pretty clear what the

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,710
caveats can be so your mission should

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,450
you choose to accept it and you kind of

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,640
all have by showing up today and being

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,590
interested in this topic is to do some

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,430
reconnaissance gather some information

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:25,400
and do some reporting you really want to

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,920
get good at identifying these sticky

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,690
points and learning how to communicate

00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,280
about them and document them so that

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,010
they don't repeat the same mistakes

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,840
again and again and I will say in that

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:40,940
room that day back in 2011 had someone

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,010
not noticed the giant grin and the

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,290
confused look we could have just breezed

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,580
past that simple comment that the

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,940
templates were completed was factual

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,770
there was no reason to dig more into it

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,090
except we realized everyone was not

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,130
talking about the same thing and it gave

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,200
us an opportunity to educate one another

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,430
and get on the same page so the future

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,130
when we were talking about templates

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,750
which we did we were talking about page

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,360
designs because that's what the most

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,580
common understanding was of that term

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,870
and from then on if we talked about TPL

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,450
as we call them TPS so when you're

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,300
gathering information what are you doing

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,940
listening it's pretty straightforward

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,670
but in the art of active listening it's

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,920
very I don't know if you guys have read

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,750
too many communications or self-help

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,880
type books it's a very deep deep well

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,430
and so I just want to hit on a few

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,770
concepts within active listening that

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,590
can be very very about valuable for

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,000
fact-checking vocabulary understanding

00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:45,430
and common vocabulary building

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,710
paraphrasing clarifying and summarizing

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,839
now I've separated paraphrasing and

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,449
summarizing spatially on

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,129
the screen because it's very easy for

00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:57,499
people to conflate these two concepts

00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,790
basically they think either they're

00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,170
interchangeable either way you're just

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,120
repeating back to someone what they just

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,699
told you but there's two reasons why I

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,920
want to distinguish between them first

00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:08,899
with paraphrasing what you're doing is

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,519
you're saying you've just told me this

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,699
information I'm going to repeat it back

00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,829
to you in my words we're going to take

00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,019
what you said and what I'm saying and

00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:20,120
we're gonna try to make them meet this

00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:22,189
is very valuable when we're talking

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,629
about the fact-checking of definitions

00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:25,459
that I was referring to earlier with the

00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,749
templates what do you mean when you say

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,279
template what do I mean

00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:30,160
okay are we making them meet how do we

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:33,319
make them meet let's go on from there

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,360
but summarizing is different and I

00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:37,879
wanted to call attention to it because I

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,160
think it's an honor underutilized aspect

00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,930
of communication summarizing is when you

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,790
repeat back to someone something that

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,689
they've just told you in their own words

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,490
I don't know if this guy this happens to

00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:51,889
you guys as much as it happens to me but

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,670
sometimes I don't say the words I think

00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:57,769
I'm saying my husband can vouch for this

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,329
and if someone were to repeat back to me

00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:02,329
or if I were to be recording this

00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:05,089
session I might hear things that I don't

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,009
think I said and so if you take the time

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,689
to repeat back to someone what they've

00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:11,600
just told you in their own words it

00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:14,300
gives them an opportunity to self fat

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,399
check to to look at what what is going

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,110
on in the situation and say yes that's

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,819
what I intended to convey or wait a

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,540
minute did I really say that that's not

00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,309
what I meant

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,410
and they can self correct so some of

00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:26,689
that onus isn't on you to paraphrase

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,300
accurately and kind of guess what's in

00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:30,949
their mind and if neither of these two

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,079
options can really get you there there

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:34,970
is of course clarifying which is as

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,100
simple as saying I need more information

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,050
can you go a little bit deeper so that I

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,699
can be sure that I understand what you

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,610
mean when you're talking about this

00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:46,069
concept but that's a lot about what you

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,259
have to do and the purpose of this talk

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:51,860
is to give you all tools so that's fair

00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:54,410
but it can also be very very valuable to

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,899
listen for these cues when someone else

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,029
is speaking to you valuable for two

00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,410
reasons first and foremost if you hear

00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,730
some of this language reflected back at

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,819
you if you were to say to me so what I

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,189
hear you saying say

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:08,220
is that active listening is important

00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:10,410
then I would be like yay you're engaged

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,600
you care what I'm saying and that's

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,729
great it's a good feeling but more

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,639
importantly if you're repeating this

00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:19,499
stuff back to me it probably means that

00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,379
you think what I'm saying is important

00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:24,119
and that fact can be very important if I

00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,649
don't think that what I'm saying is

00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,629
important if I thought I've just

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:30,629
delivered very mundane news to you it's

00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:32,160
a very basic status report or a very

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:35,459
basic term that I've used a million

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,069
times and you take the time to active

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:41,309
listen me to paraphrase me back to

00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:43,019
myself or summarize me or clarify maybe

00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,149
what I thought was so mundane and

00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,429
uneventful was actually really important

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:50,279
and we needs to stop and dig into it a

00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:51,929
little more alright so you've got the

00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,509
Intel gathering down I want to go

00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:57,179
through a few examples of what I mean by

00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:03,179
putting this into practice and these are

00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:05,160
I guess fictionalization zuv true

00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,559
situations that have happened to me so

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,720
in the one hand the client has extended

00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,909
deadline they tell you on the phone call

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,179
and in the status meeting hey we need

00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:16,859
extra time for some internal materials

00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:17,970
that were working on you guys can go

00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:20,339
ahead and have another week on that

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:25,529
deliverable we couldn't the call by

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,339
saying extra time and we did and it was

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,639
not good

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:32,069
because if we had done what is on the

00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,479
right and dug a little deeper we would

00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,489
have understood that when the client

00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:37,919
said that because of their own internal

00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:40,999
deadlines they needed to move ours what

00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,139
they were expecting was additional work

00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,689
because we had talked about some phase

00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,729
two things they thought very

00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:49,979
understandably that if we had extra time

00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:52,499
we could work some of those things in so

00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:55,229
what we did was deliver a very polished

00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:57,600
round one and they almost had no

00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:58,799
feedback on round one it was great but

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,839
they didn't recognize that greatness

00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,659
because what they were expecting was an

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,600
expanded round one not a finalised round

00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,759
one so if we had taken the time to just

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,069
quickly and settle the fact check that

00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,399
we could have avoided some trouble on a

00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:16,680
similar but opposite note we've told the

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,589
client hey we need your feedback by the

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,500
of the week and they say great and we

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:24,960
move on and then disaster strikes

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,670
because we didn't take the time to make

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,010
sure they understood what we meant by

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,839
gathering their feedback it meant that

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,820
when the client consolidated all the

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,260
internal feedback what they did was copy

00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,529
and paste a bunch of feedback they got

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,970
in an email into an Excel spreadsheet

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,250
what we meant by consolidate feedback

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,410
was actually read it and make sure it

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,089
doesn't conflict with itself and that we

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,770
can act on this feedback because you

00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,720
approve of what your peers are saying to

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,450
us and that we can do something with

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,860
this feedback rather than getting Bob

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,420
thinks that the colors need to change

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,040
and Sally thinks that we need to

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,570
completely react to text something I

00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,160
don't know if Bob or Sally actually

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,410
matters so should we actually follow

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,540
this advice so if we've taken the time

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,820
to do what's on the right and maybe just

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,050
clarify that information a bit you

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,089
really could have opened that door when

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,890
they said oh well what you know what

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,149
format do you need we could have said it

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,770
doesn't really matter what format it is

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,330
so long as you take the time to read the

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,290
comments and make sure that they're

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:21,750
actionable a few other tools that you

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,540
can use in addition to your information

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,060
gathering are some reporting artifacts

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,010
you can create a codec which is my fancy

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,810
spy language for saying glossary or a

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,770
list of terms or a bunch of stuff we

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,910
jotted down because we thought it was

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:38,160
important and keeping mission logs or

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,560
taking notes so let's talk about our

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,440
glossary first and foremost you want to

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,660
determine the best format for your team

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,370
the if you are co-located and your team

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,650
often gets together in a shared space I

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,290
highly recommend doing something visual

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,480
on the wall sticky notes whiteboard

00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,580
something that's always present that

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,920
people can reference so that way if

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,050
early on in the project you have defined

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,430
what launch means it means getting

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,410
everything that is priority one and two

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,690
done and sometime later in the project

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,790
that changes you can see it there it's

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,589
reminding you that something is off

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,690
something's not clicking and you can

00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,480
bring it up if you're not co-located

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,250
which is often the case I recommend a

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,560
digital format of this something like a

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,640
Trello board a Google spreadsheet you

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,829
know whatever floats your boat

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,990
but basically something that you can

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,420
start right away and that you can keep

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,010
up so by starting right away what I mean

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,600
is right from the

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,140
introduction of your project right from

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,570
kickoff start the project off on the

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,370
note of the importance of vocabulary

00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,310
building and common understanding for

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,900
your team go ahead and confront the

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,390
demons that you already know are lurking

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,120
in your scope of work define what launch

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,650
means to find what success is and once

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,150
you've done those things document it

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,980
share that documentation with your

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,690
entire team so that as their

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,070
understanding evolves and your

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,340
understanding evolves you can reference

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,380
it and that's to keep it up part and I

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,170
don't just mean keep it up in the way

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:07,320
that you need to continually do it which

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,870
of course I do mean but also keep it up

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,260
physically like visually show it to

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:17,670
yourselves and to your clients on a very

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,400
regular basis I once had the great

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:24,540
intention of using this list to solve my

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,100
problems communications issues and we

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,650
all got together in a big room we had a

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,760
great hearty field session where we all

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,200
talked about how we didn't understand

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,000
each other and nobody was speaking the

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,400
same language and we jotted everything

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,320
down and we felt great and for about two

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,020
months after that things were pretty

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,570
good but we had taken that list that we

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,060
put together put it on Google Drive and

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,340
never referenced it again so about two

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,870
and a half three months later as new and

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,820
new requirements were introduced as the

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,640
project phases started you know morphing

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,690
into the next and the next our

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,160
understanding of the project needs and

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,650
our understanding of each other started

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,140
to change which meant that we literally

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,060
ended up having the same meeting a few

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,370
months later to talk about the same

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,020
problems because no one was referencing

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,820
the documentation that we had produced

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,880
earlier and then when we remembered that

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,459
documentation we all felt ridiculous so

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,370
keep it up as in keep doing it and keep

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,570
it up as in as much as possible pull it

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,890
up on the screen when you're meeting you

00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,810
don't necessarily have to run through it

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,579
every time that's a little onerous but

00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,470
just having it there visually off to the

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,209
side can be a great way to keep these

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,690
concepts that you know you struggle with

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:34,770
top of mind and then from the personal

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:36,990
side keep notes every project is a new

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,120
opportunity for you to learn and for you

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,670
to recognize when you're a culprit in

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,720
creating misunderstanding and a way for

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,760
you to keep it top of

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,450
that you want to be focused on

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,070
communicating well so mine your sprint

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,140
retrospectives or your project close

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,059
outs for great Intel about things that

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,250
you're not doing well others don't do

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,350
well things that can be improved and

00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,640
keep that information with you take it

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,470
to your next project

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,580
bring your learnings from your past

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:07,470
projects to your future projects but

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,360
challenge your assumptions just because

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,220
on the last three projects people didn't

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,130
understand what template meant and they

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,780
all thought that it meant a page design

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,309
that doesn't mean that the next project

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,600
you need to just go straight to we're

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,549
gonna call page designs templates

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,440
because that'll be the time that the

00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:25,260
client thinks the page design is a page

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,789
design so you want to continually

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,200
challenge your own assumptions when

00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,299
you're talking about these concepts and

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,919
make sure that each time you're thinking

00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,409
about the fact that the person you're

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,210
talking with is new which means they

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:39,150
have new perspective and you kind of

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,030
have to start all over remember that the

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,980
mission never ends and so I hope that

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,110
you can take some of these tools and

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,470
these tricks and these concepts take

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,580
them to your project take them to your

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,610
organization at large and how you work

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,400
with your peers take them home with your

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,770
families your friends and basically

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,020
always always always challenge your

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,950
assumptions and maybe you can avoid some

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:10,110
conflicts along the way so thank you all

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:12,690
very much we do have some time for

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,770
questions it's a shorter session but we

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,880
do have some time for questions if

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,880
anybody has some

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:34,200
sure so the question was about how to

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,090
start the list off during the kick off

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,550
and how you can facilitate such a

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,840
conversation so the way I do it is a

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,390
little bit cheaty because I've been

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,130
doing it for awhile so I have a list

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,630
already built above my head if you all

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,950
wanted to start this you could easily

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,040
just steal the slide that had all the

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:52,170
words on it another great way is to look

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,050
at your scope of work and think about

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,400
anything that is not super clearly

00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,050
defined or anything that you know has

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,090
been tricky in the past highlight it and

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,030
then as you're doing your kickoff walk

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,040
through those concepts and exactly like

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,690
I was saying do some paraphrasing do

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,400
some summarize and get people to tell

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,410
you what they think it means and make

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,420
sure that you're on the same page one of

00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,620
the points I didn't hit on too much here

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,320
but that I feel is really really

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,020
important is that if you try to force

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,080
people to use your language you are

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,090
going to suffer I promise you you will

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,650
suffer because the thing is in a moment

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,210
when you're explaining a concept to

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,640
someone they can be on the same page as

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,160
you they can get behind it but when they

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,320
walk away their brain still has whatever

00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,290
her biases whatever knowledge whatever

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,120
concepts they had already there so that

00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,370
moment when you're like I explained to

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,530
the client what a site map was they got

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,140
it they repeated it back to me they drew

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,120
it on the whiteboard we were there why

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,260
when I delivered the final site map do

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,260
they not understand what they were

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,370
seeing and approving why it's because

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,500
they didn't really understand it in the

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,180
first place and so trying to find a

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,220
common language that you both can get

00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,320
behind reflecting their language back at

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,660
them can be the best way to handle those

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,450
situations because then you know they're

00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,340
gonna get it when you say the squiggly

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,450
line thing I don't care if they call it

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,980
the squiggly line thing if they know

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,900
what the squiggly line thing is that's

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,820
what we're calling it it'll get us over

00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,510
the finish line and that's all we're

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,510
really trying to do

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:30,030
so once you're in the trenches with all

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,380
the muck how do you get out of it

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,300
you kind of just have to start exactly

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,590
back there at the kickoff and that's

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,270
what I was saying about the project that

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,550
had gone off the rails we did that and

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,560
it was really successful we it's tough

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,820
it's tough to hear some of that feedback

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,340
and to realize that you didn't

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,480
communicate as clearly as possible there

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,030
were definitely some times when I

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,430
realized that my assumptions had been

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,650
part of the problem that the team was

00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:56,320
having so if you can kind of put your

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,910
own ego aside work through that and then

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,550
move forward from there with the list

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,770
always present don't make my mistake and

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,080
have that nice come to Jesus moment only

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,690
to put it in a box and forget about it

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:42,190
but that I mean I would just go right

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:44,200
back to the start yeah I think so I

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,020
think the question is about how do you

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:51,040
talk about the difference between not

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:58,060
not vocabulary understanding but actual

00:22:51,040 --> 00:23:01,390
fact right so an example maybe something

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,820
like interpretation of user data for

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,650
instance something like that like we've

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,840
all interpreted this way but then Bob

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:21,250
here thinks that it means X and is

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:27,490
really insistent that it means X they're

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:30,190
not gotcha

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,570
it does yeah so once you've built a

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,370
foundation of understanding off of

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:45,310
something that is faulty how do you

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:47,170
course correct yeah I would recommend

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,880
that once you've realized that your your

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,020
foundation is faulty and that you need

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,720
to course-correct

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,340
hitting that head on as well so saying

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,320
you know this is the information we had

00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,660
at the time this is why we made these

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,890
decisions at the time here's how we can

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,420
address it from here and here's the

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,030
impacts that it's going to have and

00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,370
here's how I'm going to dedicate myself

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:09,100
and how we can all dedicate ourselves to

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,750
avoiding this again in the future making

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,920
sure that you have a method for

00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,080
fact-checking some of those things

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,940
moving forward because the fear once you

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,600
uncover it is that what if it happens

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:27,220
again right yeah what else is lurking

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:29,350
behind the scenes any other question all

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,250
right well that brings us to time thank

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:41,090
you guys very much for your attention

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:44,080
have a great week on I swear I'm not

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,080
