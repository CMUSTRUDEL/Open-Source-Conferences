Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Top 8 considerations for choosing a local development environment
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	There has been a proliferation of local development environment options as the ubiquity of docker has removed much of the complexity of dependancies and performance problems. I will break down the top 8 considerations when choosing a framework, application or technology to enable local development and testing of Drupal:

Architecture - To Docker or not to Docker
Composer/DrupalConsole/Drush support
Configurability of environments and tests
Support for other languages
Toolset vs application
Open-Sourciness 
Implications of popularity
Options for commercial support
I will take the audience through a detailed analysis of the importance of these considerations with real world Drupal examples and then a feature matrix of current solutions / approaches.

This will be particularly useful for technical leads wishing to standardise their team on a common local development environment to accelerate onboarding and improve code testing processes.
