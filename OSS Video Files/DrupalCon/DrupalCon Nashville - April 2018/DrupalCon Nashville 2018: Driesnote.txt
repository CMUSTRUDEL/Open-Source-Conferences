excited that you're all here this week

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,580
because this is a special time where we

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,039
unite as a community to level up our

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,060

stand up you are amazing thank you

00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:09,570
so thankful so our community often asked

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,170
this question what does Drupal mean to

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,180
you and I've just been on a really big

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,460
listening tour with the community and I

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,820
often asked this question to everyone I

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,490
meet and I am incredibly inspired by all

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,770
the answers I hear and when I was just

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,680
in Germany meeting with that community

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,130
they actually turned it on me and asked

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,920
me what does Drupal mean to you and my

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,380
answer is I believe that Drupal creates

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,630
meaningful relationships that matter

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,860
because they improve your life and they

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,979
just make the world a little bit

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,440
brighter and we see this all the time in

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,750
the community we talk about our special

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,550
relationships and dreams even highlights

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:58,920
them in his Driss note but you know

00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,320
these special relationships are also

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,710
happening with the digital experiences

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,649
that we create with Drupal and that's

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,080
because Drupal allows us to customize

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:13,860
human experiences between organizations

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,740
and the people they serve you know when

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,930
a university builds a website and an app

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,020
it's not just a website and an app

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,710
they're fostering a student through a

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,640
lifelong journey to start a career

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:33,240
that's really special so raise your hand

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,950
if you have had a Drupal digital

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,950
experience improve your life

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:43,160
yeah I see a lot of hands up well me too

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,570
in a lot of different ways but

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,720
specifically this summer when I

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,720
witnessed the total solar eclipse and I

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,420
used this website that NASA built with

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,690
Drupal it gave me all the information

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,910
that I needed what time to be outside

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,850
where to go and all the information I

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,700
would need to fully understand this

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,820
experience that I was witnessing and

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,690
because of Drupal scalability it helped

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,480
me and 40 million people unite around

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,150
the celestial event that gave us a brief

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,320
moment of odd together and it's a day I

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,280
will never forget

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,620
so thanks NASA and these digital

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,750
experiences are happening all over the

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,640
world when I was in the Netherlands I

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,890
learned about this Drupal site that won

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,850
an award and what it's doing is

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,590
connecting doctors with patients and

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,820
giving those people the information they

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:45,690
need to take control of their life and

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:47,610
it's working there are 12 percent less

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,060
doctor visits because of this site

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,370
that's 8 million less doctor visits

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,440
just imagine the millions of people now

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,970
who are moving forward with much happier

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,330
and healthier lives because of this

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,090
website I think this is a really special

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,370
story and we want so many more of these

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,500
happening around the world and that's

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,160
why the drupal associations goal this

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,200
year is to help grow drupal adoption and

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,859
you know we don't want to grow for

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,609
growth's sake we want to grow so we can

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,919
scale the impact around the world and to

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,680
do this we're gonna have to really lean

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,870
into our mission to unite the global

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,150
open source community to build and

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,700
promote Drupal we're gonna have to

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,130
really focus on those action verbs unite

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,870
the build to promote and what I mean by

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,419
that is we have to keep working together

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,270
as a community and build the right

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,790
things so that people fall in love with

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,830
Drupal more and more and then we have to

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,540
work together to figure out the right

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,119
way to promote it so more people know

00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,599
how great Drupal is

00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:56,330
and juries is gonna talk about this in

00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,889
his dreams note and I'm really excited

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,849
to start working on some initiatives

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:03,379
with you but before we get to the dreams

00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:05,659
note let me give you some highlights

00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:09,879
about this week that I'm really excited

00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:12,459
about so first we're gonna start

00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,679
expanding DrupalCon

00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:18,050
it is and always will be for builders

00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:21,229
and what I mean by that is the people

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,809
who build the community who build Drupal

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:28,129
the people who are building digital

00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:29,990
experiences with Drupal and then the

00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:33,169
people who are building businesses

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,949
around our software it will always be

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,569
for all of you we also want to open it

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,999
up for other people that are very

00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:44,300
important to digital experiences

00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:47,479
especially those who choose Drupal like

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,659
the CMOS and the CIOs and we also want

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:53,719
to open it up for those who use Drupal

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:56,029
in the marketing departments let me talk

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,129
a little bit about the choose side so

00:05:56,029 --> 00:06:00,860
these are the CMOS the CIOs

00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,659
they're the ones that decide if we're

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,509
going to have Drupal in our organization

00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:07,189
and we want them here so we can tell

00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,680
them just all the things that they can

00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:12,860
do with Drupal and why they should come

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,869
and join us and I did some phone

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,149
interviews about a year ago and asked

00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:20,539
how could we make Drupal con more

00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:23,259
valuable for you and they said you know

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:25,579
I came to Drupal con and it was great

00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,459
but there wasn't really anything for me

00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:29,990
so I don't have a reason to come back

00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:33,490
but I'm really glad you called because I

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:37,279
want to be a part of your community and

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,619
we want them to be here too and we want

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,079
them to join us in our community and so

00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:44,300
we have started to expand what we can

00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,519
offer to them starting with a new track

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,149
called the technical leadership track

00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,550
and we are also going to have a

00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:55,369
roundtable discussion with this group

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,469
today after the DRI's note so we can

00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:00,050
talk about how to create an on-ramp into

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:02,719
our community because we can really use

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,139
their help and it'd be great to have

00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:06,050
them

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,749
our community now looking over at the

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,610
other side the people who use Drupal in

00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:15,529
their marketing departments like content

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:19,520
editors campaign managers SEO we want to

00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:22,580
serve them - when I was at Drupal camp

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,310
London speaking I presented that's right

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,930
whoo

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,300
when I was at ripple camp Lenin speaking

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,789
I covered topics like Drupal in the

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,759
marketplace and it was very marketing

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:38,090
specific and at the end a content editor

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,180
came up to me and said thank you so much

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,729
for speaking in words I understood I

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,949
understood how Drupal is used by a

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,719
marketing person and they said you know

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,159
I'd go to Drupal events and I I don't

00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,960
really feel it's for me they're talking

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:55,099
about modules and other things that

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,919
don't help me in my job we want to

00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:00,949
change that we want them here at Drupal

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,529
con - and so we have started to expand

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:06,379
in that area as well and we now have the

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:09,110
content and editorial track and we're

00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,089
really excited to expand in this area

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,849
and get more people who are marketing

00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:16,669
experts to come because we want them to

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,740
join our community - can you imagine if

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:22,039
we had more marketing people helping us

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,139
promote Drupal and our camps and all the

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:28,219
other amazing programs that we create

00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:29,649
together so I'm excited about this and

00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,630
you'll see more of this over the next

initiative because we want our speakers

00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:05,079
to reflect the great diversity within

our track chairs 40% of our speakers are

00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,880
from underrepresented groups that is

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,400
amazing

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:23,820
[Applause]

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:26,670
and also for the first time we have the

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,540
open web lounge we are building bridges

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:33,480
with other projects so that we can

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,460
protect the web together and I am proud

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,470
to work with automatic who helped get

00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,170
the booth and together we pulled in

website we have suggested programming

[Applause]

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:44,540
so we could not have this event without

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,000
the help of all of our sponsors and it's

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,430
not just about how they subsidize the

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,550
cost of your ticket it's the knowledge

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:56,750
that they bring to our event in so many

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,639
ways sessions as well as the people at

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,389
their booth so go and talk with them and

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,500
get their tips from the trenches and

00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:07,639
raise your hand if you use Drupal org

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,029
yeah you do

00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,610

00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:15,160
amazing supporting partners so many

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:21,190

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,710
alphabetical order because I don't want

00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,930
any burnout while everyone's trying to

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:03,280
get to some number one spot it is all of

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:06,430
us working together we also have many

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,920
businesses that are sponsoring our work

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,330
which is really important and it's

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,270
businesses from lots of different

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,170
industries and so we're thankful for

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:19,000
them as well

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:22,000
and as you might recall we recently had

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,250
to rely on a very important team to help

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,560
with a security issue so I wanted to

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,180
take a moment to thank the security team

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,800
for all of their hard work and for

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,800
protecting all of our websites

00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:48,039
Bravo okay and now for just some

00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:50,709
housekeeping we want DrupalCon to always

00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,869
be a very welcoming event and that's why

00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,879
we have the code of conduct so check it

00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:57,579
out in your program guides or some signs

00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,189
around the Convention Center and if you

00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:00,999

00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:17,589
Hirsch lead developer advocate of

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,589

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,009
[Applause]

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,760
hello everyone I'm Steve Kirsh lead

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,980
developer advocate at Pantheon Pantheon

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,230
is proud to again be a sponsor here at

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,500
Drupal con and I'm happy to say that

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,650
personally Nashville is my tenth Drupal

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,570
con introducing juries here today has to

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,900
be thinking back to my first Drupal con

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,940
San Francisco in 2010 you might remember

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,550
that one as the year of the Icelandic

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,520
volcano eruption things were a little

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,680
different back in 2010 the decision had

00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,640
just been made to switch version control

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,640
systems from CVS to get 2010 saw the

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,650
debut of Project Mercury a pantheon

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,050
precursor built with the idea that

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,260
Drupal would scale if you did it right

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,660
and in 2010 at the DRI's note we heard

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,180
how concepts like the Semantic Web would

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,120
allow the entire Internet to function as

00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,069
one giant database with each person

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,910
controlling the information they shared

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:29,370
about themselves well in 2018 those

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,220
giant databases are out there but the

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,200
controls are lacking we've seen over the

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,330
last eight years what happens when the

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,760
values of open source are not the

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,400
drivers of growth for that giant global

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,530
graph but at Pantheon we still think

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,380
open source can win out when it scales

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:49,350
well in the last year we've scaled the

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,900
security of HTTPS to be an included

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,460
feature at every plan level in the last

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,830
year we've moved the majority of our

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,600
infrastructure to Google cloud a change

00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:01,500
that makes it easier than ever for us to

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,720
fulfill our 99.95% uptime guarantee and

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,240
by building on the best modern

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,610
infrastructure available by taking the

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,920
performance of Drupal cache metadata to

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,110
the edge of a global CDN we find that

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,360
sites moving to Pantheon commonly run

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,820
upwards of 50 percent faster than they

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,850
did on previous DIY configuration of

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,130
in-house servers or another cloud with

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,230
standardized infrastructure web teams

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,080
can focus on what makes their sites

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,300
special they can publish content and

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,730
deploy code changes without friction

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,990
Drupal succeeds when we make it as easy

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,050
as possible for

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,440
people to own organize and publish their

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,150
content so now let's hear from a man who

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,300
knows the value of owning your own

00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,490
online presence he's leading by example

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,679
with his own blog he's using a posse

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,080
strategy of publish on your own site

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,720
syndicate elsewhere I recommend you

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,420
check it out on his blog so now everyone

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,020
let's hear from the man of the hour the

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:04,530
creator of Drupal the blogger from

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,870
Belgium by way of Boston the driver of

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:13,450
the drop breeze bot art

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:13,450
[Applause]

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:27,160
I was awesome the blogger of Belgium

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,140
that's the first good morning and

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,970
welcome I've actually never been to

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:35,290
Nashville but I'm very excited to be

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,360
here for the week I have a lot to cover

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,560
in this Driss note and so we decided to

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,470
do things a little bit different like

00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,470
I'll be talking for an hour and then

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,900
we'll have a separate Q&A session on

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,500
Thursday so you can still tweet your

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,750
questions

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,340
I think it's hashtag grease nerds will

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:59,290
pick him up and then we'll talk about

00:19:51,340 --> 00:20:02,440
all your questions on Thursday so as I

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:05,290
was preparing for this keynote I spend a

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,260
lot of time thinking about the past

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,300
actually you know went back and was

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,990
thinking like wow this little thing that

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:18,550
started in my dorm in Belgium has grown

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:20,320
quite large after 17 years and I was

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,980
thinking about all the impacts that

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,490
Drupal had and has right from giving

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:31,230
people a voice to preserving the open

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,820
web to helping thousands of nonprofits

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:37,000
fulfill their mission right and if I

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,850
think about the combined impact of

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,400
Drupal I'm really excited right I really

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,290
want to help drive that forward and so

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,380
in preparing for this keynote I actually

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,180
spent a lot of time thinking about the

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,570
future and the things that we need to do

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:55,870
to continue to grow Drupal so that way

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:59,320
that we can can continue to have the

00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:02,470
impact that we have so the central theme

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,510
of this keynote will be you know growth

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,520
together so the keynote will be

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,220
organized in three sections you can see

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,500
them here I'm gonna start with an update

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,020
on Drupal 8 I'm going to talk about how

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,640
we can grow adoption of Drupal and then

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,940
I'm also going to talk about how we can

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,660
foster the community all right so let's

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:26,260
start with Drupal 8 I'm sure you've all

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:29,770
seen that we release Drupal 8.5 about a

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,510
month ago which was a great release was

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,340
the effort of a lot of people

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,180
so thank you very much for everybody

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,260
that contributed we released it on time

00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,420
right we're getting really good at

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,580
release management and you know

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,550
delivering on on those dates as we

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,560
promised we would and best of all it

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,230
actually ships with lots of great new

00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,450
features you know we made significant

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,180
improvements to making Drupal easier to

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:59,940
use thanks to the media initiative and

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:02,620
the content moderation module as well we

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,420
started to simplify site building you

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:08,590
know we added a setting stray and an

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:11,140
off-campus you know capability that's a

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:14,590
really valuable building block to start

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,330
simplifying the experience this one is a

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,990
big one

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:26,800
after years the migrate module is stable

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:29,530
yeah more than a hundred people made

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,840
this happen it was a very big effort and

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:35,020
this is a very big milestone

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,760
it works for non multilingual websites

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,160
if you have a multilingual website we're

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,680
still working through some final issues

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,540
but I really encourage people to start

00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,180
upgrading their sites if you haven't

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,970
already and then we've also been working

00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,310
really hard on making Drupal API first

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,110
this is something that we've been you

00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:56,290
know investing in really that we've been

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,090
working on for two-and-a-half years and

00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,460
I really feel like with eight point five

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,800
things are starting to come together in

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,860
Drupal this is really becoming a state

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,460
of the art API first platform and so

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,890
it's very exciting and so as a result

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,870
you know because of these improvements

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,910
and the REST API organizations are

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,920
really starting to build these ambitious

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,020
digital experiences that have been

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,810
talking about here's an example of New

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,490
Balance obviously of a Drupal site a

00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,970
regular Drupal site that they also use

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,680
Drupal in a decoupled way to power in a

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,120
mobile application right

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,120
Drupal acting as a Content repository

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,700
and then they allow customers or users

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,470
of this this mobile app to personalize

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,620
it based on the sports they're

00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,590
interested in you know the things that

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,250
they like instead of a very custom

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,650
experience and it also

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,080
grades with these watches so it's pretty

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:53,410
cool to see large brands adopting Drupal

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:58,930
8 to build sort of you know new kinds of

00:23:53,410 --> 00:24:03,400
experiences I have another example Chris

00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:06,850
hamper decided to use Drupal 8.5 to

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,960
build a argument reality application so

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,900
I'm gonna show you a little video and

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,330
Chris himself narrated the videos I'm

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,280
gonna play it for you

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,990
what you see here is decoupled react VR

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,390
app that uses Drupal 8 to power a

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,250
virtual tour the tour is built up of

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,770
interjected scenes each with a

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,840
360-degree photo or video panorama that

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,880
could be explored as well as ambient

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:40,570
sounds and hot spots that show images

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:42,400
videos and textual information we wanted

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,660
to create an immersive user experience

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,120
that took advantage of many of the

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,040
things that make Drupal 8 stand out all

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,380
of the content including media there's

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,320
on a Drupal site the scenes are modeled

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,330
as nodes of a custom content type using

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,480
Drupal core some media initiative

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,220
modules and paragraphs in fact no custom

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,690
code was needed on the Drupal side other

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,510
than a tiny bit of admin interface

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,520
theming the react via our front-end runs

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:09,280
in any web browser and even on a web

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,260
enabled VR headset it pulls in the scene

00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,870
information from Drupal using JSON API

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,940
this was super simple to setup thanks to

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,040
the work of the API first initiative

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,540
I've seen VR and Drupal years together

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,060
but wanted to take it to the next level

00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,650
I considered what ways can we integrate

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,440
the admin experience with the VR

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,440
experience how can we import content in

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,660
the simplest way possible we decide see

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,460
if we could enable a site admin to use

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,830
drag and drop to pull media right into

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,810
the VR scene and precisely position the

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,390
elements all from within the Drupal

00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:42,100
back-end looking at a scenes node edit

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,590
page you can see how it's built up a

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,210
structured content the same principles

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,580
that have made Drupal so powerful and

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:56,260
flexible for years can be reimagined and

00:25:48,580 --> 00:26:03,820
used in novel ways that cool

00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:05,290
oh pretty cool to see how you know all

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,420
of the building blocks that we have in

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:09,130
Drupal 8 can be used and there's a lot

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,050
of other great things on the horizon you

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,790
know things that we're working on for

00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,920
future releases of Drupal and you can

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:18,220
see some on the screen but I want to

00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,680
highlight two of them and that's the

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,960
work that's been happening on drag and

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,260
drop layouts and page building as well

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,550
as the better out-of-the-box experience

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,980
and so I'm gonna show you a video of

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,000
these two things combined all right and

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,870
I'll talk a little bit more about it

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,820
after but here's what that currently

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:42,780
looks like and what we're trying to work

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:45,790
towards so here you see basically the

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,790
layout builder and you can add sections

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,350
and then within each section you can see

00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,930
that you can add a block and these

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:55,480
blocks can be anything could be content

00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:57,370
like we do here but it could be you know

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,050
little experiences as well doesn't have

00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:04,150
to be just content we make it easy to

00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,170
find content and to do it serve with a

00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,780
new actually a you know setting straight

00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:12,880
you can also use at section to sort of

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,700
stack a section in a section and this

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,660
allows you to build much more complex

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,920
layouts here we're gonna just add a big

00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,870
block into that section that you see

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,790
here on the screen and then each of

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,810
these blocks you can click on and then

00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,430
you can you know change the

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,010
configuration or you can move them

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,840
around or moving them around here here

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,730
we'll see or show how we can actually

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,020
make a change like we're gonna change

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,520
from plain style to a green filter so

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,080
the content looks a little bit more

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,090
agreement just an example of the things

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,400
that we'll be able to do and do very

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:49,660
easily so this is pretty cool isn't it

00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,490
people have been working really hard to

00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,620
making this possible and I'm very

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:59,080
excited to see this in future versions

00:27:53,620 --> 00:28:01,780
of Drupal now the images that you see

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,510
here are part of the out-of-the-box

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:08,080
initiative right and so what we decided

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:10,150
to do is we wanted to instead of sort of

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,130
launching people in an empty Drupal site

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,110
like we do today we want to give them an

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,530
option people an option to

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,270
you know select this install profile and

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:24,650
instead of an empty website they will

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:26,450
get a website that looks like a you know

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,970
a magazine website and in this case a

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:32,330
food magazine website and this is great

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:34,940
for a couple of reasons one if you're an

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,680
evaluator you can actually see Drupal in

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,990
action they can actually see a real site

00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,390
and so that's good for evaluators it's

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,250
also good for you know sales people

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,050
people that want to show Drupal to

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,090
potential customers right they can

00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,680
actually go and show something but it's

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,510
also good for people that want to learn

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,120
Drupal because you can actually look

00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,740
under the hood and see how these content

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,430
types have been created how the views

00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:02,750
have been constructed and the likes

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:05,780
right and so of an interesting or a

00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:08,930
funny little anecdote here because as a

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,450
team was working on this install profile

00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:14,390
and the theme and the images somebody

00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,730
said you know is it actually okay to use

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,800
these images because we're gonna ship

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,440
this variable and there's like a million

00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,080
Drupal sites right so these images will

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,350
end up in a lot of places we don't know

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,330
if we have the copyright and so Keith

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:32,270
who is one of the you know key

00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,160
contributors to the out-of-the-box

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,500
initiative basically said you know what

00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,070
we need to we need to cook these recipes

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:43,370
and take our own photos so we can safely

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:46,130
distributor all right and then you know

00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,990
he started cooking and his wife Sharon

00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:51,320
basically had to stop him because he was

00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,660
making a huge mess in the kitchen and so

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,550
she got involved and she's also they

00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,170
both run a business the Drupal shop so

00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,140
they're both Drupal business owners and

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,150
so together they started cooking all of

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,330
these recipes and then Holly was a

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,190
colleague that helps them in their

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,420
business also got involved and so all of

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:14,060
a sudden the three of them decided to

00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,650
cook all these recipes and you know

00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,180
contribute them back to Drupal it's a

00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,330
wonderful story so I reached out to

00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:23,680
Holly and Sharon and I'll let them talk

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,680
about this for a little bit

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,299
these covers we had some of the images

00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:35,100
through we want to use but not the

00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:39,000
recipes to go really having recipe

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:43,590
activities sometimes it was sneaking to

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,049
get quiche

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:49,070
now we need a recipe for it do you

00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:51,750
realize it was Dover food since to avoid

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:54,299
like the shoes and the only way that we

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,679
would be able to do that is to create a

00:30:54,299 --> 00:31:02,820
food and that basically linking and

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:07,850
coming up with original recipes it's the

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:10,320
only way to avoid it smaller options

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,150
spend a whole weekend the whole week and

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,350
we've still got some recipes and hints

00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:18,870
to publish yeah it was like 13 14 15 -

00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:22,169
Cheers and we had to be really careful

00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:23,730
that we didn't create a recipe that was

00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:26,490
similar to anything that had already be

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,510
previously published so there's no

00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:32,940
discrepancies there

00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:37,010
I wanted something that really suited so

00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:41,070
it was really worth but it was an epic

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:44,429
niches are great how well the pictures

00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:50,909
came out professionally look Oh help

00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:53,400
professionals at home yeah amazing

00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:56,010
Nino's you took that yeah it might in

00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:01,500
that sense that it's people donating

00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:05,190
their time to get involved and it's nice

00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,710
actually using other channels to get

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,059
feedback from other contributors sharing

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,690
it with other people involved in the

00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:15,240
initiative that was before and I'm

00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:24,049
actually quite shocked to myself who

00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:24,049
could make sponge cake yeah

00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,350
it's these things that make duple great

00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,390
you know and they spend a whole week

00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,710
booking a whole week I mean just to

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,299
contribute to the out-of-the-box

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,190
initiative it's pretty cool

00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,250
there's a lot of other great things on

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,740
the horizon I can't go into all of them

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,960
today but you can see some of them on

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,909
the screen now all of these things come

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,100
together in a road map and I'm not gonna

00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:50,620
go through all of the details here I

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,450
also wanna you know give a caveat that

00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,299
because we're a large community of

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,760
volunteers and because we're constantly

00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:59,649
re-evaluating what we do and how we work

00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,640
this isn't necessarily set in stone but

00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,980
this is our best

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,490
you know intent right now of what we

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:08,470
like to deliver again I'm not gonna go

00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,240
to all of the details here but I wanted

00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,850
to show you roughly what we're focused

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,640
on and so what you see in the blue is

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:18,909
really things that make Drupal easier to

00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,830
use for content creators and also site

00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,480
builders so we're really focused I think

00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,190
it's about three-quarters of the screen

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,210
should be light blue we're really

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:31,029
focused on that persona and yellow you

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:33,429
see things that we're working on that

00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:36,159
will make it easier to maintain and

00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:38,049
install Drupal as well as migrate Drupal

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,419
and then we're also focused on

00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:43,960
differentiation and you can see in red

00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:45,850
is primarily all of the stuff around the

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,980
API first initiatives well which you

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,470
know allows us to do some some pretty

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:53,250
cool new things I think if we do all of

00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:56,200
these things we will really see Drupal 8

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,940
accelerate I'm very excited about this

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,909
roadmap and the fact that we have a

00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:04,630
roadmap which we haven't always had in

00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:06,340
the past on top of that we can see the

00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,510
Drupal 8 adoption is growing

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,899
substantially we saw 51 percent increase

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:16,149
in adoption of Drupal 8 websites

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:19,990
compared to a year ago this is based on

00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:21,159
the data that we have available and you

00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:24,639
know this one is even better

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,520
better the module ecosystem of

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,190
contributed projects not just modules is

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,669
really accelerating as well like just in

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,470
one year we have 81 percent more stable

00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:38,060
modules we have even more ma

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,640
in development and to put that in

00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:43,310
perspective you know what it means is

00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,590
that in the first like two two and a

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,450
half years of Drupal we had X modules

00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,640
and just in the last year we had roughly

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,950
the same amount of modules that became

00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:56,060
stable so it's very encouraging in my

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:59,360
mind for Drupal 8 readiness so in short

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,650
I think Drupal 8 is doing you know

00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,400
better and better think it's doing

00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,920
pretty well

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,650
we have a plan the module ecosystem is

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,780
becoming mature we're making it easier

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,910
and easier to use for content creators

00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,500
and site builders and evaluators with

00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,600
the out-of-the-box initiative the

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,610
community is very engaged porting all of

00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,490
these modules we're releasing Drupal 8

00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:22,310
on time and we see more and more you

00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:24,590
know in impressive digital experiences

00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:30,350
come online with Drupal 8 as well so

00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:33,350
that's a quick update on Drupal 8 next

00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:36,050
I'd like to talk about growing Drupal

00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:38,120
adoption alright so I think it's

00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:42,440
important that we continue to find ways

00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:45,680
to grow and so what we did is I asked

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,800
the team at Acquia to to go and

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,650
interview people and so they talked to I

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,350
don't over a hundred people in parallel

00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,210
Megan from the Drupal Association need

00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,580
to say she went on a listening tour and

00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:01,310
listened to people all around Europe

00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,630
actually in the US an Annie Miller who

00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,880
is a board member of the Drupal

00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,800
Association also ended up talking to a

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,340
lot of people asking them questions

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,100
about how can we accelerate Drupal 8

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,840
what's blocking you with Drupal 8 right

00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,770
and so we get all these questions or

00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,870
answers back and what we saw is you know

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:23,000
a lot of consistent patterns the people

00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:26,570
the things that people were saying were

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,530
very consistent depending on regardless

00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:34,510
of where these people were and so what

00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:38,630
we did is we looked at all these answers

00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:40,490
and we picked out things that we felt

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,870
were really important to address you

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,840
know the patterns are bubbled to the top

00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:47,480
and we carefully selected items to

00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,640
tackle that we felt we're both both

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,900
realistic and achievable

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,299
all right so I'm going to show you some

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,579
of these things and all of them in my

00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:57,890
mind we should be able to do in twelve

00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,569
months or less all right so these won't

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,769
be huge initiatives like some of the

00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:03,039
ones that we have but there will be

00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:06,769
smaller things that we can tackle

00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:10,970
relatively quickly they're all organized

00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:13,220
in four categories four categories of

00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,690
things that we need to do I'm gonna walk

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,670
you through each of those I'm going to

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:21,499
start with improving the technical

00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:23,180
evaluation process this was actually

00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:25,880
interesting because as we were doing the

00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,529
research Matt knew Grasmick actually

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,739
wrote a blog post about this how many of

00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:33,529
you have read this blog post all right I

00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:36,079
get a good amount of people and so what

00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:41,239
Matthew did a compared to installing

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:44,749
Drupal to other PHP frameworks and what

00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:48,140
he learned is that it was really hard to

00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:49,970
install Drupal like he basically needed

00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,859
to click more than 20 times and he spent

00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,170
more than 15 minutes just getting it

00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:57,619
installed and he gave up counting and

00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,359
timing right it can wait longer compared

00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:02,089
to some of the other frameworks which

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,420
was a lot easier to do and so I reached

00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:08,119
out to Matthew and I asked him to record

00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,739
that experience right and so not only do

00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,109
we have a blog post I'm gonna show you a

00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:14,109
video of what the experience looked like

00:38:14,120 --> 00:39:13,550
[Music]

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:25,970
there is a side I summon I saw many of

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:29,690
you laughing but I'm not sure you know I

00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:31,160
think we should I love this image it's

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,859
like this little kid he starts with

00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,329
laughing and then he starts crying

00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:39,260
that's how I felt when I first watched

00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:41,329
his video it's kind of funny but it's

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,670
really sad it's what it's telling you

00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:47,180
right and so if you think about what

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:50,059
Matthew showed us is this entire you

00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,920
know evaluator path right from the

00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:54,619
discovery on drupal.org trying to

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,140
download it using documentation to get

00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:59,000
it installed then the actual

00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,010
installation process itself and then you

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,710
know to being able to start the trial

00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,119
experience once it's installed so if you

00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,400
think about all of the initiatives that

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,010
I just talked about and the roadmap that

00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,050
I showed you all of these things are

00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,300
focused on people that have already

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,859
installed Drupal right so we haven't

00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,619
really focused on the entirety of the

00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:21,770
experience and so what we should do is

00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:23,839
do exactly that and this is something

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:26,359
that we heard loud and clear not just

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,640
from Matthew but a lot of people that we

00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:32,089
interviewed told is this like it's just

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,359
too hard to install and and to evaluate

00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:38,000
and so what we need to do is we need to

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,760
make it easier to discover download and

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,640
install Drupal using documentation and

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,520
then once it's installed once people get

00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,470
into Drupal we need to really demo the

00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,980
strength of Drupal versus giving this

00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,540
blank page and that experience needs to

00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,220
look really good because first

00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,960
impressions matter you know and people

00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:00,410
try these things first impressions

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,869
matter and so what we did is we talked

00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,180
to the Drupal Association and they

00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:07,190
agreed to help fix the you know serve

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,349
the path on the website to to the

00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,140
evaluator experience it's actually part

00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:14,809
of their plan for 2018 and just a couple

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,540
days ago they already launched a new

00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:19,809
homepage you know with the help of 611

00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,809
yeah

00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:26,359
it's exciting and they're starting to

00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,979
focus on personas like you can see here

00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,900
so if you're a technical evaluator you

00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:31,880
would probably click developers and sort

00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,999
of launch into that experience if you

00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,710
are a non-technical evaluator like a

00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:39,049
marketer there can be a different

00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,880
experience because those people may not

00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:42,499
want to install Drupal they may want to

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,239
look at videos and things like that

00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:47,599
right so we can make an optimized

00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,640
experience for each of these personas so

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,979
we're going to get that done and we're

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,059
already working on that then we need

00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:57,739
better documentation and I'm talking to

00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:00,170
Matthew who wrote the blog post and

00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:02,650
created the video he has agreed to join

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,489
the documentation working group

00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,499
discussed this with the documentation

00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:08,539
working group and Matthew is gonna run

00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:11,390
an initiative to get our documentation

00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:19,670
for the getting started experience fixed

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:22,309
so yeah Thank You Matthew we need a

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,529
better demo and a very accessible demo

00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:27,019
of where Drupal can do and I think

00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:28,640
hopefully we'll get the umami and the

00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:31,460
out-of-the-box experience into Drupal

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,660
8.6 the next release and that will fix

00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,660
that one so that's good too

00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,880
and I've shown you this before but um

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:47,340
and lastly we also need to make the

00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,990
experience sort of of Drupal better -

00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,030
and so we've been talking to people

00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:54,900
about this and we decided to take a

00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:56,849
two-phase approach right so step one we

00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,099
want to do a refresh of the admin fee

00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:01,369
and we'll do that you know relatively

00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,990
simple with CSS and things like that and

00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:06,210
Christina and Roy have already been

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,920
prototyping some things and I've also

00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:11,460
agreed to lead an initiative to help

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,849
refresh the Drupal admin fee so we get a

00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,970
better out-of-the-box experience longer

00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:19,680
term I think we should be making more

00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,030
drastic improvements right we should

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,980
think about the information architecture

00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,230
is that still good we should think about

00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,920
making a lot of the interaction patterns

00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:31,140
more dynamic and so hopefully the work

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,800
of the JavaScript modernization

00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,750
initiative will help us do that in time

00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,359
and so I think we have a plan for this

00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,330
as well this is what Drupal looks like

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,950
today and this is what it looks like

00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:46,619
with some of the experimentation that

00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:50,160
Christina and Roy are doing and so it

00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:52,380
looks a lot more fresh this may not

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,150
matter to some of you but I can tell you

00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,670
it matters a lot to the people that we

00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:58,230
talk to especially the less technical

00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,470
people because if they imagine this

00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,660
spent eight to ten hours a day using

00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:06,060
Drupal right they're creating content

00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,859
and doing all of these things and so

00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,109
when you spend that much time using

00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:12,570
Drupal the experience really matters and

00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:15,540
so I think it's a great initiative and

00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:20,130
I'm excited to see where this will get

00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,960
us so that was number one number two is

00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,500
to improve the content creator

00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,510
experience again we had this we heard

00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:31,980
this loud and clear from a lot of people

00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:33,869
a lot of people and you know in these

00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,849
interviews we heard that people want

00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:37,619
like a Facebook like experience or a

00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:40,650
travel like experience so what's

00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:43,440
happening is in their day to day life

00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,570
people use these very easy to use web

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,000
applications and you expect the same

00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:50,520
kind of experience from Drupal right and

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,860
so if you look at Facebook for example

00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,020
they make it very easy to upload

00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:58,350
multiple images while these images are

00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,470
uploaded it can already start changing

00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,150
the captions and the titles if like

00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:04,680
advanced features like geo-tagging I

00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,850
mean you can do all of these things

00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,860
super easy and that's what people want

00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:13,080
people want these kinds of things and if

00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:15,510
you compare that to Drupal you know it

00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,270
looks a lot more basic another you know

00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,550
intuitive right and so there's a big

00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,610
Delta between what these applications do

00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:26,700
and what Drupal us does today now

00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:29,490
fortunately the people behind the media

00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,930
initiative are working on this right and

00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,030
what they're working on looks a lot

00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,430
better than what we have today it's

00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,800
tremendous progress and I'm very excited

00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,620
about the work they do and I encourage

00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,990
them to keep making progress right in

00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:46,110
fact I think we should really look at

00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:47,970
competitors this is Squarespace and you

00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:57,480
see them you can see how they do page

00:45:47,970 --> 00:46:02,370
building but there we go whoo Thank You

00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:05,340
AV team more things are coming online

00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,810
here I can't quite see it yet but what

00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,360
we need to do is improve the content

00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,760
creation experience right we need more

00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,330
drag-and-drop be stuff for media

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,670
management layouts and page building and

00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:19,770
these two first items are critical to

00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,950
almost everyone that we spoke to the

00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,900
third item is about staging content

00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,600
staging and previews which are critical

00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,070
for the people that needed it so it's

00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,350
almost like binary if you need it it's

00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:33,330
critical if you don't need it you know

00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:36,090
it's not critical and then people also

00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:40,860
asked for this modern administration

00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:42,660
experience now the first three items are

00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,340
actually existing initiatives that we've

00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,380
already launched and we have teams of

00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,130
people working on that right so that's

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,560
great news

00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:51,450
we're working on the right things and

00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,060
the last item I've already spoke about

00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,070
in the previous section right it's what

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,380
we're doing with the Refresh of the

00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,750
admin team and over time we'll have the

00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,090
JavaScript modernization initiative

00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,789
which will help us build something even

00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,569
more compelling

00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:09,309
so that's two the third thing we need to

00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:15,369
do is improve the site builder

00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:18,609
experience no it's happening

00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:20,259
oh wait a second there we go

00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:23,859
maybe I should stand still it's just

00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:29,559
like in Vienna if I walk around bad

00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:33,489
things happen so we need to improve the

00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,929
site builder experience and as we

00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:37,449
interviewed people there is a lot of

00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:38,619
different pieces to this one of the

00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:39,880
things that people mentioned was

00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:42,699
configuration management and

00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,919
configuration management is actually new

00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:47,349
in Drupal 8 right it's not something

00:47:44,919 --> 00:47:49,599
that we had in Drupal 7 and so we have

00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:52,899
two and a half years of learning with

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,669
configuration management and inner

00:47:52,899 --> 00:47:57,939
student have years we've learned a lot

00:47:54,669 --> 00:48:00,339
of things and what we have come to the

00:47:57,939 --> 00:48:03,189
conclude is that there's key you know

00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:04,689
features missing and so to explain you

00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:06,609
what configuration management is I mean

00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:08,349
it I think a lot of people understand it

00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:10,630
but allows you to make changes to your

00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:12,789
development environment push these

00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:15,389
configuration stages to staging and

00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:18,969
ultimately do production right it's key

00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:21,219
for building applications nowadays and

00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:23,939
so well this is great

00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:26,589
we need to support more real life

00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:32,109
workflows and an example of that and in

00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:35,499
just one example is is let's say you

00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:38,739
have an email service like send RIT but

00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:41,099
you wouldn't want to happen is that your

00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:44,409
Q & A team the Quality Assurance team

00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:48,249
accidentally emails all of your users

00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:50,259
while they're testing right and so that

00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:51,939
would happen because all of the

00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:54,219
configuration is the same and so your

00:48:51,939 --> 00:48:58,179
you know access key or whatever to this

00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:59,829
email service is you know stored in

00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:01,569
staging and so really what you want is

00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:03,669
you want to be able to have contextual

00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:08,079
configuration so that maybe in this case

00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:09,969
in this example you can have you know

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,979
test keys right so you don't end up

00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:15,909
emailing all of your users how many

00:49:11,979 --> 00:49:17,330
people have done that see a lot of

00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:19,070
people have done this

00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:22,100
and so really Drupal should make that

00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:23,330
easy there's many other examples of this

00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,920
kind of thing I just wanted to give you

00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:27,620
one example and so we need to make it

00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,160
more contextual and we need to better

00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:33,920
support these common developer or close

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,510
right the second piece the second item

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,410
that a lot of people brought up was

00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:45,290
composer I can already feel like the

00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:47,390
composer but composer is important and

00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:51,050
so I want to talk about it next and so

00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:52,550
in Drupal 7 we were on an island and it

00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:56,000
was a very special Island it's a

00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:58,310
floating island as you can see there was

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,190
this party on the mainland and we

00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:03,440
weren't able to go to the party and so

00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:05,570
what we did in Drupal 8 at least the

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,530
core developers they started using

00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:11,690
composer to manage you know dependencies

00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:15,350
on other PHP projects and so it allowed

00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:17,600
us to use and reuse what other PHP

00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:19,910
communities were building like symphony

00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,590
would be a great example or tweak right

00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:25,040
and to manage all of these pieces we

00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:27,230
started using composer and so in talking

00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,510
to all of these people a lot of the

00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:32,030
technical people said that they too want

00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:33,620
to use composer for their stuff you know

00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:36,440
for managing sites for building their

00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:39,920
modules and so in many ways we got like

00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,620
half of the island because it works for

00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,150
core and core developers contributors

00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,580
but it doesn't quite work for the rest

00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,740
of the world yet right and so what we

00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:51,650
need to do is we need to go all the way

00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:55,280
to the mainland so we can join that

00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:57,890
party and this would help us would help

00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,100
contribute module maintainer x' use

00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:02,960
their you know use other libraries and

00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,760
stuff like that right and so it prevents

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,540
us from having to reinvent the wheel and

00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:10,190
all of these things now we do need to

00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:13,220
make this better I do want to make it

00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:15,980
very clear that we're not proposing that

00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,960
composer becomes a requirement or that

00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:20,060
it becomes the only way of doing things

00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,310
right there can be multiple ways of

00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,710
doing things what we're talking about is

00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:26,840
making the composer option better so

00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,140
that it's like it's a first-class option

00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,029
right

00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,769
is this actually interesting because we

00:51:31,029 --> 00:51:34,599
could use that work to build less

00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:36,880
technical solutions or non technical

00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,740
solutions on top of that like for

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,630
example automated updates which I spoke

00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,849
about in Vienna or maybe a project

00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,680
browser there is a potential that we can

00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,930
build these solutions on top of composer

00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,730
we have to we have to experiment with

00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:52,299
that and we have to research that but I

00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:53,589
think that's an exciting part this by

00:51:52,299 --> 00:51:56,769
the way is not something unique to

00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:59,099
Drupal or PHP all of the other web

00:51:56,769 --> 00:52:02,200
communities are doing exactly that

00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:05,319
JavaScript with NPM Ruby with bundler

00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:09,400
and so it's basically us doing what the

00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:10,930
rest of the world is doing and so we

00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,549
heard loud and clear from a lot of

00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:16,990
people is that we need to make this

00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:19,420
easier the third thing that we heard a

00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:22,720
lot about is how are we going to make

00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:25,089
required updates easier right a lot of

00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,710
people said this is really hard and so

00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:32,049
the current situation is that every six

00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:34,509
months we have a minor a new minor

00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:36,069
version of Drupal like 8.5 and it comes

00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:39,519
with all of these new features like the

00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:41,220
ones that I showed you and and that's a

00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:44,920
great thing it's great for innovation

00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:47,890
but after every minor the previous minor

00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:50,829
goes unsupported right and so that means

00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:54,250
that development teams have six weeks to

00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:57,819
upgrade before losing security coverage

00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:59,710
and that can be a challenge because as I

00:52:57,819 --> 00:53:02,740
mentioned we've added these new features

00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:05,319
in every minor and so because of these

00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:07,059
new features teams need to prepare for

00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:09,400
the upgrade they need to test for the

00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:11,799
upgrade and then they need to do that in

00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,720
time and this happened six sorry this

00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:16,720
happens twice a year not six times a

00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,890
year and so the feedback that we got is

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,529
a you know this is actually a bigger

00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:24,430
hurdle then we had with Drupal 7 and

00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:26,410
it's tough for us to adjust you so one

00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:28,630
approach there might be other approaches

00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:31,869
one approach that we could take is we

00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:35,170
could extend the security support for an

00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:36,640
entire minor release right and so we

00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,460
need to think about this carefully and

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,470
we're figuring this out because it would

00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,450
create more burden on the security for

00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:44,490
example

00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:45,810
group is largely volunteers so they

00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,000
would have to take on more work and we

00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:50,760
need to figure out how we can support

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,980
them it also has implications for

00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,230
contributed modules we may have to

00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,690
support semantic versioning for cam trip

00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,670
and then also has implications on the

00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,950
Drupal Association because it may have

00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:04,500
to make changes to Drupal the doric to

00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:07,020
support this as well so a lot of things

00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:10,680
to figure out but that's an idea that

00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:12,210
was suggested by several people so to

00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,609
improve the site builder experience we

00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:17,630
need to do these three things

00:54:13,609 --> 00:54:20,130
configuration management composer and a

00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:24,359
longer grace period between required

00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:28,430
updates so the first two we proposed

00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:30,510
initiatives in the issue queues and so I

00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,099
think there's alignment between a

00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,890
different stakeholder so we invited all

00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:37,079
of the stakeholders to the conversation

00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:39,630
the contribute module authors that have

00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,000
built solutions for this internship as

00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,650
well as the core committers and there's

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,390
a general consensus that it would make

00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:48,060
sense to move some of these capabilities

00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:50,940
into core so what we're doing right now

00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:54,690
is figuring out the details in the issue

00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,359
queue so I feel pretty good about you

00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:59,460
know getting this fixed in you know in a

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:02,010
reasonable amount of time and really the

00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,900
same thing is happening here the

00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:06,240
security team and the Drupal 8 release

00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,060
managers are working together on

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,280
figuring out how to make this possible

00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:14,310
and as I said this team is largely

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,740
volunteers and so more dedicated people

00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:19,050
on the security team would help a lot so

00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,210
if you have any employees that are on

00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:22,800
the security team consider giving them

00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:25,530
some more time because that would allow

00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:29,819
us to move forward with this you know

00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:31,319
most likely so I think these are the

00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:34,589
three most important things that we've

00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:36,540
heard and I'm happy that we have put in

00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:41,190
place a lot of plans to fix them

00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:42,690
hopefully over the next 12 months last

00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,380
one I want to talk about is promoting

00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:48,480
Drupal to non-technical decision-makers

00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:50,700
and this one we also heard loud and

00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,359
clear but let me explain a little bit

00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,280
how I see you know things and what has

00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:58,650
happened so historically

00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:03,030
it was technical decision makers

00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:04,710
selecting the CMS and the first 15 years

00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:07,050
of Drupal we saw tremendous growth

00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:09,360
because of that you know techies love

00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:11,630
Drupal they love open source we've

00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,090
definitely won their hearts and minds

00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:16,830
but more recently things have changed

00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,420
like if you think back ten years ago a

00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,550
website was probably something people

00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,350
spun up they copy paste and some text in

00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,150
it and then they walked away from their

00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:25,980
website maybe came back after two weeks

00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:28,620
like it wasn't something that people

00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:30,840
spent their their Daisy right and so now

00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:33,090
we have a lot of non-technical people

00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,430
marketers content creators that spend

00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:39,570
their entire day you know working in a

00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:41,430
CMS and so increasingly more they are

00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:44,760
influential in the decision making

00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:47,220
process of what CMS to use and they look

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,710
for things like how easy it is to use

00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,510
right so it's very very logical to me

00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,890
and so a lot of these people don't know

00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:57,600
Drupal if they do know Drupal they may

00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,250
have the wrong impression of Drupal or

00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,400
Drupal may have a bad reputation with

00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:04,110
them they also don't necessarily

00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,510
understand open source as well as

00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:08,700
technical people do right so we need to

00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:11,700
educate them on the values of open

00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:13,830
source but if we want to grow it's

00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:17,490
critical that we address this persona

00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:20,040
and that we really optimized for this

00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:21,810
persona in addition to optimizing for

00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,090
the technical persona not saying we

00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:26,550
should drop the technical persona but we

00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:28,200
need to really focus on this this became

00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:30,690
really clear when talking to the

00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,250
agencies you know we heard it from

00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,830
non-technical people but we actually

00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,500
heard it louder from Drupal agencies

00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:39,780
because they're trying to sell Drupal to

00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,400
these people right and they said we need

00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:45,120
more help selling to non-technical

00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,710
decision-makers and I need you people to

00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,660
get on the radar of non-technical

00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:52,260
decision-makers so please help me and

00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,460
the way to express that is in you know

00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,920
give me sales support

00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:58,920
give me demos give me white papers give

00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,320
me you know give me documentation that

00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,460
compares Drupal with other CMS's so I

00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,950
can actually win when I'm in a

00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:08,550
competitive situation right so they need

00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:10,100
a kind of support now if you think about

00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:12,600
the

00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:15,180
the way we're organized on the

00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,290
technicals on the non-technical side is

00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,170
a little bit like this we have the

00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:21,510
Drupal Association we have all these

00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:23,370
Drupal agencies we have local Drupal

00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,560
Association that are promoting Drupal

00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:27,510
and all of these organizations are doing

00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,670
great things right they're all trying to

00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:32,450
promote rupal but we're not really

00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,650
working together as much as we should be

00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:38,730
right and so really what we should be

00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:40,710
doing is collaborate and funny enough or

00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:43,380
at least I think it's a little funny is

00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:44,940
we do an incredible job collaborating on

00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,710
the technical site I mean we've built

00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,080
one of the largest communities in the

00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:51,990
world and thousands of us are

00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,900
collaborating on code we build tools we

00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:56,640
build processes you know all of these

00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,290
things to get really good at technical

00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,380
collaboration and we have nothing like

00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:05,970
it on the non-technical site isn't it a

00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:09,120
little ironic and so in talking about

00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:11,130
this I discussed this with Megan at the

00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,380
Drupal Association and with the Drupal

00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:16,200
Association board actually and we felt

00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:22,620
the best way to get started is to

00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:25,260
actually you know hire hire somebody

00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:28,590
that can help us you know

00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:31,170
coordinate all of these volunteers right

00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:33,090
and if we do that I think we can get

00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:35,430
some amazing results

00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:38,970
you know maybe launch Drupal in space

00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:41,520
just like des loaded but joking aside I

00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:43,950
think having a marketing initiative to

00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:47,010
promote Drupal could really help Drupal

00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:52,100
8 take off right and so again what we

00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:55,890
want to do here is is is launch $100,000

00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:59,610
I'm sorry fundraise $100,000 and we will

00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:02,130
use that money to hire a coordinator as

00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:03,680
part of the Drupal Association staff to

01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:06,840
get all of these different groups

01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:10,710
associations agencies to collaborate on

01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,910
producing these marketing materials some

01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:16,230
of that money would also go to

01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:20,700
organizing sprints or to you know create

01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:23,160
certain assets and so I challenged Megan

01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:27,450
only four or five days ago and I

01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:30,150
if you can raise $50,000 by the Driss

01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:34,020
note I will wear a cowboy hat on stage

01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:39,200
and so she did it she texted me

01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:39,200
yesterday you know

01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:55,410
so she was also kind to provide me that

01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:56,300
hat so here I am very very happy to see

01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:58,410
there's a lot of organizations

01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:01,890
contributed to this and I think it's a

01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:03,960
testament to how much people want this

01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,580
right when we told people about this

01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,650
they're like yep I need this and I'm

01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,500
willing to give you money for this in

01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:11,370
addition to that we had individuals

01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,380
contributing it doesn't have to be just

01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:16,470
the agencies that contribute to this so

01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:19,700
hopefully if you can we would welcome a

01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:21,870
donation and let's see if we can raise

01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,610
$100,000 by the end of the week that

01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:26,850
would be fantastic we can get going on

01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:28,740
this initiative if that doesn't work we

01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:33,030
may have to use the Drupal dork servers

01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:33,980
for some cryptic mining but we're gonna

01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:36,950
get there somehow

01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:40,100
hopefully it's by collecting donations

01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,100
all right

01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,460
today's are the four the four things

01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:52,880
that we discovered all of these are you

01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,560
know here in an overview you can see all

01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,150
of the different stakeholders this was

01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,800
something very new to us to work with

01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,530
all of these different stakeholders not

01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,420
just the core contributors you can see

01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:04,070
the issued IDs of where we're proposing

01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:07,070
these plans and what we're already

01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:09,890
discussing them you see that for most of

01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:12,050
those we have already you know belém

01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:14,270
tears the offer to be the initiative

01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:16,160
coordinators so they're working on these

01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:18,830
things who are still looking for some

01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,000
people so please still get involved if

01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:22,280
you want to find them a little bit more

01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,130
easy instead of remembering the issue

01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:27,770
IDs you can basically search for

01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:31,790
simplified Drupal in the issue queue and

01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:33,050
you'll find them very easily and so as I

01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,880
said I think all of these things are

01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,980
doable most of them are already in

01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,900
progress and I think if we do them and

01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,330
we do them well we'll deliver a

01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:42,920
competitive user experience will do a

01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:44,870
much better job promoting Drupal's

01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,000
benefits to non-technical

01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:50,540
decision-makers will have a better

01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,340
evaluator experience and will have

01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,900
better documentation and we'll make it

01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:56,360
easier for people to build and maintain

01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:58,660
triple sites so what do you think that a

01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,660
good idea

01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,250
obviously these are just our suggestions

01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,920
based on all the research if you have

01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:12,869
ideas of your own we welcome those too

01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:15,450
there's many many ways to get involved

01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:18,450
here we definitely encourage you to do

01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:21,390
that right for the last section of my

01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:24,030
keynote I want to talk about fostering

01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:26,040
the community I'm actually gonna take my

01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:31,500
hat off because it's kind of an

01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:33,960
important topic and so as I've said in

01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,690
the past I think you know it's really

01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,640
the community that makes the heart of

01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,760
Drupal right it's not the software it's

01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,560
not the bits it's the people that do all

01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,859
these wonderful things to support and

01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,940
grow Drupal that makes it special

01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:49,650
because but out the community there

01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:53,190
would be no software and I was actually

01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:57,570
a reminded of that last Sunday not too

01:03:53,190 --> 01:04:00,150
long ago when we hosted with the Drupal

01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:02,070
Association we invited a number of

01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,170
community leaders and we spent a half

01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:06,180
day talking about what we can do to grow

01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:08,400
Drupal and just hearing their stories

01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:10,470
about all the ways they're helping to

01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,910
grow Drupal is just fantastic and

01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:15,180
actually I got a little bit emotional

01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:17,280
about it in the end so this is an

01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,580
important topic so I want to talk about

01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,880
that next so if you think about the

01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:26,190
history of Drupal you know since our

01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,170
starts Drupal has grown tremendously

01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:29,609
right like you're one of the largest

01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:31,260
open-source communities in the world

01:04:29,609 --> 01:04:33,420
there's tens of thousands of people

01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:37,410
contributing in a variety of different

01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:39,119
ways in the process in those last 17

01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:42,090
years we actually spent a lot of time

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:44,190
scaling the project not just a technical

01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,990
side but the governance and the

01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:49,260
community side all of these things and

01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:52,050
in many ways a lot of other open-source

01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,970
communities they look to us and they say

01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,980
wow we wanted to be like you

01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:57,660
Drupal like we want to have the same

01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,910
kind of things in place that you guys

01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:03,359
have in place and so we're a role model

01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:05,220
for you know the vibrant ecosystem that

01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:07,650
we have how we do release management how

01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:10,380
we do security the collaboration tools

01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:12,869
that we've built the culture Drupal con

01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,940
how we sustain large large events all

01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:16,460
around the worlds

01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:19,700
and so there's a lot to be proud of here

01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:23,809
and we really should be having said that

01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:26,450
in those 17 years the work of scaling

01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:29,869
Drupal has never been done it's a

01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:32,180
continuous process and we have more to

01:05:29,869 --> 01:05:34,490
do even though were in many ways for a

01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:37,490
role model there's more to do and I'm

01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:38,990
gonna make it a focus for myself and I

01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:43,250
know others are gonna make it a focus as

01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:47,920
well in 2018 to continue to scale how we

01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:52,480
work together and I wanted to start with

01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:54,980
our values right and so remarkably

01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:58,690
despite the fact that Drupal is 17 years

01:05:54,980 --> 01:06:01,549
old we've never documented our values

01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:04,329
it's kind of like really strange in a

01:06:01,549 --> 01:06:07,280
way and so we need to write them down

01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:10,280
and I think that has become clear in the

01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,829
last few years because you know market

01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:15,380
trends technology trends we had some

01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:17,450
difficult times in the community all of

01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,520
these things combined I think made it

01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:22,640
clear that it would be very valuable to

01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:26,210
have our values documented and this was

01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:28,599
also communicated by the community by

01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:31,400
the Drupal governance working group

01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:33,140
right and it's in difficult times that

01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,609
people want to hold on to our values and

01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:38,150
refer to our values and if they're not

01:06:34,609 --> 01:06:40,460
written down like it's hard and so the

01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:44,349
time is prompt to write them down and so

01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:48,319
I spent the last five months really

01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:48,799
trying to write them down as a starting

01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:53,150
point

01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:55,849
not as a final you know point and so I

01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:58,700
wrote and I rewrote showed them away

01:06:55,849 --> 01:07:01,339
started again run it by people it was a

01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:04,849
very difficult process to come then 17

01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:06,980
years of learning into you know a set of

01:07:04,849 --> 01:07:10,130
values and principles so it's

01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:13,099
challenging work it was hard work and by

01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:16,250
no means will it be perfect right but I

01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:18,740
wanted to make a starting point and so

01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:23,900
what I came up with is Drupal's values

01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:25,770
and principles and I condensed it to

01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:28,500
five values

01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:31,560
and behind those five values is a set of

01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,619
principles to make it more concrete the

01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:36,000
five values are these the first one is

01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:38,070
prioritized for impact

01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,250
I talked a little bit about this in the

01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:43,619
beginning of the keynotes but I do

01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:46,440
believe that the impact that Drupal has

01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:49,650
really in many ways is our collective

01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,359
purpose as a project right and so some

01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:54,240
of the principles we'll talk about that

01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:56,970
the second one is strive for excellence

01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,589
I think a lot of people can probably

01:07:56,970 --> 01:08:00,839
relate to this one I think in the

01:07:58,589 --> 01:08:02,280
community we're never happy right we

01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:05,070
always want to do better we're not

01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:07,500
afraid to constantly reevaluate

01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:09,210
ourselves and we're not afraid to change

01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,640
things just think about going from

01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:14,820
Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 right we're always

01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:18,270
trying to do better and so the second

01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:21,239
value is all about top the third value

01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:22,950
is about collaboration it really talks

01:08:21,239 --> 01:08:24,839
about the importance of the community

01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:27,120
and it's what makes a project special

01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:33,120
the work we do together is really what

01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:34,680
makes us great well the previous one was

01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:38,339
about how we all work together as a

01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:40,620
large group this one is about how you

01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:43,520
know interpersonal reactions are we

01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:47,339
you know behave you know one to another

01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,930
and lastly there's enjoy what you do

01:08:47,339 --> 01:08:50,640
this is sort of the recognition that we

01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:52,529
have fun you know if them fun together

01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,500
whether it's a pre know their trivia

01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:57,089
night or maybe wearing a hat on stage we

01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:01,400
should always have fun in the things

01:08:57,089 --> 01:09:04,859
that we do and so behind each of those

01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:08,880
there's a set of principles that I'll

01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:11,910
show you next and I won't go over all of

01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,790
these but I'll show you one and

01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:18,569
basically it's a chunk of text that

01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:20,670
explains you know in this case it

01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:23,279
explains some leadership leadership

01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:26,279
principles what we expect and not expect

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:29,509
from leaders and so I courage you to go

01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:33,330
read those well I've published them

01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:35,640
publish them today on our website you

01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:39,020
can go find them and Peter those flash

01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:41,060
principles and it's one go to alpha

01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:43,250
the Alpha is important because as I said

01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:45,560
they're not done but I got to a point

01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:48,529
where I wanted to enroll all of you

01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,210
invite all of you to give feedback right

01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:53,029
so I'm opening it up to the community to

01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:55,610
help them make better I think we should

01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:57,140
test them we should debate them we

01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:59,840
should make them more robust maybe

01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,450
there's Prince principals missing you

01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:07,090
know certain needs aren't met and so we

01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:10,100
should definitely work on them together

01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:12,250
and then we should find ways to live

01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,250
them

01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:25,780
so this will be a living document will

01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:29,050
have releases or software engineers

01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:32,110
after all and so over time I really hope

01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:34,030
it will help us work together even

01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:35,350
better right that's really the goal of

01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:37,330
the document and I wanted to just

01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:38,800
highlight it to wrap up the keynote I

01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:40,930
wanted to highlight three of those

01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,180
principles and I don't want to show you

01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:47,470
text but I wanted to bring these things

01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:49,210
to life with a couple stories right and

01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:53,470
so the ones that I've chose for this

01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:58,630
keynotes you can see on the screen the

01:10:53,470 --> 01:11:01,090
first one is choose delete and you know

01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:02,380
it's reading Twitter and I was in the

01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,710
beginning of the year a couple of months

01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:08,800
ago I saw this tweet from mark Conroy

01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:09,940
and you know mark is one of the

01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,060
contributors to the out-of-the-box

01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:16,450
initiative and he got involved with

01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:18,430
Drupal by two years ago and it was just

01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:19,780
trying to create a theme for himself and

01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:21,880
then ended up creating teams and

01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,860
contributing contributing them back and

01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,990
all of a sudden he finds himself

01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:28,390
contributing to core with the out of the

01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:29,800
box initiative and you could tell from

01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:32,200
his tweet that it was really like

01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:34,870
inspired by that right and so it's a

01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:37,210
great example of how somebody can choose

01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:39,240
to lead and so the the choose to lead

01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:41,350
principle when you read it you'll see

01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,000
you know talks about the fact that

01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:44,800
leadership is something that's not a

01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,450
point it's not something that's given to

01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,160
you it's something that you step into

01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:52,360
yourself you know he'd take on the

01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:55,540
responsibility in the ownership and make

01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:57,160
it work and so I reached out to mark and

01:11:55,540 --> 01:12:02,380
have a little video of Mark talking

01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:03,820
about his experience a lot of people say

01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:07,260
that one of the biggest barriers to

01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:10,360
adoption in Drupal is the lack of teams

01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:12,400
that are available and I looked at

01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,800
converting some teams from WordPress

01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,650
into trouble so I converted the work as

01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:21,070
2017 team to Drupal that's the official

01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:23,950
WordPress theme for new stolperstein I

01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:25,150
converted and dynamic new is like team I

01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,360
think it's called and some other teams I

01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:29,659
was looking at and

01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:31,639
I put those all on triple org and then

01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:32,960
about two years ago women leaders I

01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:34,520
think it was mentioned to me would I be

01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,559
interested in helping out with a new

01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:39,079
team for Drupal core and I taught yet

01:12:36,559 --> 01:12:40,880
just sounds great and a team was put

01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:44,210
together and I joined them with Lowry

01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:47,090
and Keith J and Christina Jimmy's and

01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:48,349
some other people and we started working

01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:50,389
on what eventually became the out of the

01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:52,159
box initiative and at the end of that I

01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:54,770
thought wow this is just amazing all

01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:56,059
together I not alone can create a Drupal

01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,590
team now and contributed to the

01:12:56,059 --> 01:12:59,090
community and I've mentored some people

01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:01,400
and getting their get started and things

01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:03,860
they - as Drupal Demers but the official

01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,510
team for a new profile for Drupal core I

01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,699
was one of the people that made that

01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:08,960
happen and I wasn't the main person and

01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:10,190
I didn't do all of the work and I

01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,889
certainly didn't you eat most of the

01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:14,389
work but it just felt amazing to be part

01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:16,219
of that team along with the rest of the

01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:18,079
people that was just yeah I think I was

01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:20,150
does my contribution highlight for

01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,949
Drupal the last maybe two years I've

01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,139
really felt I'd found my place in the

01:13:21,949 --> 01:13:27,409
community in terms of I would go to true

01:13:24,139 --> 01:13:28,909
bootcamp London or go to the con and I

01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:30,559
hung out with mostly Irish people

01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:31,760
because I knew them and I kind of find

01:13:30,559 --> 01:13:34,340
narrow I can be wandering around the

01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,449
corridors and you know 25 or 30 percent

01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:37,520
of the people there I would know on a

01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:39,739
first-name basis and if I meet him the

01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,420
barrel around I go and we chat and

01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:43,219
there's no sense of who are you and

01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,440
where do you come from if we become

01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:47,570
friends with a lot of people I love the

01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,369
English throughput folks and a lot of

01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:51,139
the Dutch folks I've become very good

01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:52,880
friends but it gave me a career that I

01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:54,590
never thought I'd have I had always

01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,270
loved teaching and I'd always loved web

01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:57,650
design I taught if I wasn't teaching

01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,059
words that would be a good career but

01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:01,130
since I haven't got the college to study

01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:02,420
web design I presumed or computer

01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:04,579
science I couldn't I could never do that

01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:05,900
as a career using Drupal showed me yet

01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:07,790
hey hang on most people do did

01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,230
everything for you and you can do the

01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:11,300
configuration part so I became a site

01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,949
builder and then I realized I knew

01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,989
enough to excite though then hey I can

01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,909
change the CSS and so that allows me to

01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:18,980
do some front-end team and then I

01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:21,020
realized after that a jQuery isn't too

01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:23,059
hard and jQuery is in Drupal core so I

01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:25,659
can I can write interaction scripts so

01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:28,659
without that yeah it changed my life

01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:28,659
yeah

01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:37,530
such a great example and it's a great

01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:39,270
example of juice deletes but I think

01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:41,550
it's also a great example of how it's

01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:43,830
rewarding right like he did this and all

01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:46,440
of a sudden he built these meaningful

01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:48,960
relationships that Megan talked about

01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,880
and it was very very empowering to him

01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,030
and so mark actually is a great example

01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:56,219
also of the second principle which is

01:14:54,030 --> 01:15:01,020
everybody for everyone has something to

01:14:56,219 --> 01:15:02,699
contribute right and so you know this is

01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,340
really what makes ripple so successful

01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:07,469
the fact that so many of you individuals

01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,719
and organizations have contributed and

01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:11,159
contributed contributing can mean many

01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:14,179
different things right I want to be

01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:16,560
clear it's not just code it could be

01:15:14,179 --> 01:15:18,840
financial support like donating to our

01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,800
marketing initiative could be writing

01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,869
documentation

01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,869
it could be organizing events it could

01:15:21,869 --> 01:15:26,730
be mentoring others it could even be as

01:15:24,869 --> 01:15:28,560
simple as telling one of your best

01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:30,540
friends about Drupal that is a

01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,699
contribution to write and so if you

01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:35,429
think about it that way everyone has

01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:37,949
something to contribute and as I said

01:15:35,429 --> 01:15:40,190
Mark is a great example of an individual

01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:43,199
contributing code in this in this case

01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:47,670
there's also organizations contributing

01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:50,280
and lately Pfizer is an organization has

01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:53,070
contributed a lot to Drupal several

01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,650
full-time people working on the workflow

01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:58,250
initiative and so had a chance to talk

01:15:55,650 --> 01:16:00,540
to Mike lamb who is a senior director

01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:03,330
architecture engineering and development

01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:06,949
advisor and of a little video that

01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:06,949
explains why Pfizer contributes

01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,350
faiza use Drupal at the core of our

01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:20,800
digital platform strategy we started

01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:22,300
this in around 2012 at that time we had

01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,890
around 60 different content management

01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:27,040
systems that we were we were launching

01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:29,170
sites on so as of that time as of 2012

01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,090
it became the only go forward platform

01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:33,280
since then we've launched several

01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:35,560
thousand different sites on Drupal and

01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,810
it still averages out as more than one

01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,610
site being launched every business day

01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:42,640
since we initially made that decision

01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:44,860
and those sites go from very large

01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,920
complex portal type sites with lots of

01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:49,090
different integrations now also to

01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,560
applications that are the content back

01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:52,930
in for mobile applications were

01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,110
omni-channel campaigns all the way down

01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:57,400
to small simple web sites and that may

01:16:56,110 --> 01:17:01,210
be deployed to many many different

01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:03,310
markets but Drupal for us delivers the

01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:05,190
entire spectrum every website initiative

01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:07,630
that we launched is launched on Drupal

01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:09,730
so in terms of what we've contributed to

01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:12,190
Drupal in Drupal 7 we did a lot of work

01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:14,500
around the deploy module and and waste

01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:16,330
the staged content and then deploy that

01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:20,140
across the environment that was done in

01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:21,850
contrib and we started to look at how we

01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,860
do this in Drupal 8 it certainly wasn't

01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,660
a case of just migrating those modules

01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:28,060
to work with Drupal 8 so that's

01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:29,800
gradually through experimentation with

01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,410
contrib modules and then ultimately into

01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,820
the workflow initiative that led to the

01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:36,070
Drupal 8 what flow initiative well we've

01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:37,660
contributed with with multiple people

01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:39,640
effectively working full-time on that

01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,490
initiative and then other people working

01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,660
part-time it's always better to

01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,070
contribute that enhancement back to the

01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:48,220
community rather than to try and

01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:49,510
maintain a local performers absolutely

01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:52,660
when it comes to maintaining our sites

01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:54,400
it's more cost effective to do that also

01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:55,780
my experience the teams who contribute

01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,940
back and I can see this through data

01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:59,830
through the credit system the teams who

01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:01,780
critic who contribute back more on

01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:05,170
Drupal or they deliver higher quality

01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:06,390
sites they absolutely do they write code

01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:08,230
that they're actually proud of and

01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:10,240
collaboration with other parties which

01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:13,210
is essentially in software development

01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:15,010
is second nature to do this they don't

01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,320
 these models to make minor changes

01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:19,540
which can cost a lot for us to as to

01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:21,910
maintain them and they've always build

01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:23,240
things assuming that they are going to

01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:25,520
be used by other people

01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:27,920
so people build things in ways where

01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:31,820
they can actually be reused which can be

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,020
of great benefit both from just the cost

01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,400
of rebuilding something as well as

01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:37,040
accelerating to the very pretty

01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,390
accelerating time to value because you

01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,490
only have the thing that's ready to be

01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,590
reused rather than rebuilding it so

01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:44,810
being part of the broader community it's

01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:46,790
and Drupal itself it certainly it makes

01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:49,300
you feel proud and certainly when people

01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:52,790
are doing work that makes it intercourse

01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:54,980
is without a doubt a sense of pride that

01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:57,470
they have done work that's made it into

01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,390
this this this project this used by so

01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:01,160
many websites and it also means when you

01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:02,840
come across a Drupal website or you

01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,120
notice this if your website in some way

01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,430
this certainly certainly pride this

01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,290
there so Drupal really becomes part of

01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:11,030
part of your life with many people on

01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:13,130
the team and they're very proud of

01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:17,890
working with it and it's a great great

01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:17,890
feeling so yeah thank you Mike

01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:25,289
it was a great interview actually we

01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,570
talked for about an hour and I'd love to

01:19:25,289 --> 01:19:30,900
publish a longer version because there's

01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:34,260
not only does Mike an advisor I should

01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:36,659
say have several people working on core

01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:38,519
full-time but you know Mike also

01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:41,670
explained like how they work with 30 40

01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:43,769
different Drupal agencies every day and

01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:46,260
how they require each of these agencies

01:19:43,769 --> 01:19:48,929
to contribute that that's a requirement

01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:56,039
to hire them right and so think about

01:19:48,929 --> 01:19:58,679
that so yeah and so it's sort of Pfizer

01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:01,349
driving a lot of innovation in directly

01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:03,239
and indirectly so imagine we can have 10

01:20:01,349 --> 01:20:05,849
visors in the community right that would

01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:07,710
be game-changing so hope to share the

01:20:05,849 --> 01:20:10,469
longer video with you and send it around

01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:12,329
to your bosses they can take some

01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:15,869
inspiration from from from Mike and

01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:17,780
Pfizer so finally to wrap it up I want

01:20:15,869 --> 01:20:19,769
to talk about principle one and I

01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,570
carefully made this principle one

01:20:19,769 --> 01:20:24,300
because to me at least it was the most

01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:27,239
important principle because I think a

01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:29,130
lot of us contribute to Drupal you know

01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,749
because we have to you know because we

01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:32,849
have to make a customer successful

01:20:30,749 --> 01:20:35,369
because we have an itch to scratch as we

01:20:32,849 --> 01:20:37,679
say in open-source but often that's not

01:20:35,369 --> 01:20:42,840
it right we contribute because we have

01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:44,269
to do those things but also because you

01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,769
know it's special to contribute

01:20:44,269 --> 01:20:48,510
something that so many other people can

01:20:46,769 --> 01:20:50,760
use and Mike actually talked a little

01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:52,650
bit about that in this video and so we

01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:56,840
do we derive meaning from our

01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:59,369
contributions when they matter to us but

01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:02,510
even matter more to other people that's

01:20:59,369 --> 01:21:05,489
really important and so had a chance to

01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:09,860
talk to Rebecca who works at the Drupal

01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:09,860
Association about this principle

01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:23,360
I'm Rebecca and I am director of

01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:26,360
marketing for the Drupal Association in

01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,360
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:42,930
I'm Rebecca and I am director of

01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:45,370
marketing for the Drupal Association in

01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:48,310
2013 I was diagnosed with type 1

01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:50,380
diabetes that happens when your body's

01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:53,380
immune system is fighting something else

01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:55,420
and then decides to kill the beta cells

01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:57,880
in your pancreas and you can no longer

01:21:55,420 --> 01:22:00,340
produce insulin for managing was type 1

01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:02,560
you take a baseline of insulin to keep

01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:05,140
yourself alive insulin is very precise

01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:07,120
the difference between one unit and 10

01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,300
units of insulin they both look like

01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:12,280
little drops when you put them on to

01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:15,640
direct of getting it wrong it's the

01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:19,360
difference between covering an apple and

01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:22,360
dying within 30 minutes so it's a huge

01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:25,060
risk factor and the human error involved

01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:27,220
in that can be devastating with a pump

01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:30,600
it it's right you can see mine right

01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:33,970
here what's my omni pod and I have a

01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:38,020
remote control for that so I feel the

01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:41,440
pump with insulin I usually have an

01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:44,290
extra here and that gives me a constant

01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:47,380
drip of fast-acting insulin so rather

01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:49,570
than taking a 24 hour long-acting that I

01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:52,990
can't adjust throughout the day I get

01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:56,340
micro drips of fast-acting insulin every

01:22:52,990 --> 01:23:00,100
5 minutes so the device on the left arm

01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:01,810
yes is measuring blood sugar blood sugar

01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:04,810
and the device on the right arm is

01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:07,600
injecting insulin yes okay I'm a robot

01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:10,300
yeah so tell me how does Drupal come

01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,670
into play here about a year and I got my

01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,980
pump and my continuous glucose monitor I

01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:17,470
had listened to some of the dreams notes

01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:19,690
about ambitious digital experiences and

01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:21,160
I thought in my head I wonder what these

01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:23,860
are built on because they're very

01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:25,990
complex systems and the data that I can

01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:28,900
plug in and cross-reference and see

01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:31,690
what's going on and I messaged Tim

01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:34,330
Lennon on slack and said how do I find

01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:36,370
out if if something's built on Drupal

01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:38,140
and he gave me a couple pointers and I

01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:41,110
said I think that my medical devices are

01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:43,360
built partially in Drupal and Google

01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:45,610
search to see if any stories popped up

01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,410
or case studies and a couple things

01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:49,360
popped up and then I kind of clicked it

01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,880
all together and it was this odd moment

01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,740
I made

01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:54,080
chart and a blog post I wrote you know

01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:55,730
there's me and I support the Drupal

01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,940
community by working at the Drupal

01:23:55,730 --> 01:24:02,150
Association and the community builds the

01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:04,550
platform and the platform supports these

01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:08,890
two devices and they keep me healthy and

01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:11,750
alive it's this nice little circle

01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:14,960
leading from one to the other supporting

01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:16,700
around and keeping me healthy I think it

01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:19,760
is really important for the community

01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:21,050
and and everyone who works with Drupal

01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:25,700
to understand the impact that it can

01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:27,500
have because it there there are great

01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:30,410
websites and there are ambitious

01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:35,350
experiences and then there are really

01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:38,350
really meaningful things that can happen

01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:38,350
yeah

01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:48,140
such a cool story and it's amazing is

01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:49,940
there's so many other stories right this

01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:51,980
is just one of the many many stories in

01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:54,200
the Drupal project but at least give me

01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:57,110
a sense of purpose to keep going what I

01:24:54,200 --> 01:25:00,260
do and I hope many of you feel the same

01:24:57,110 --> 01:25:02,330
so what I would like to do is keep

01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:04,070
telling these kinds of stories and

01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:06,770
making part of the principles and the

01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:10,310
values and I recognize that the stories

01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:12,410
I told today in the lucky and diversity

01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:15,620
and so I really need more help in

01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:17,240
bringing more diverse stories you know

01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,980
to the principles and into the keynote

01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:21,740
so please if you want to tell your story

01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:24,140
don't hesitate to reach out to me it'll

01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:26,120
keep making this better and better so

01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,850
that's really what I had you know I

01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:32,360
wanted to talk about these three things

01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:34,670
I feel that Drupal 8 is really making

01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:36,680
great progress becoming easier to use

01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:39,290
the module ecosystem is becoming more

01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:41,690
mature engagement from the community is

01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:44,570
very healthy with a strong track record

01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:46,000
releasing Drupal on time and we're

01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:50,380
starting to see some really impressive

01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,940
visual experiences you know come to life

01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:55,040
we're gonna focus on growing adoption

01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:57,230
you know launched a series of new

01:25:55,040 --> 01:26:00,500
initiatives and we're already have many

01:25:57,230 --> 01:26:02,420
of these things underway I'm excited

01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,740
what that means for Drupal in the next

01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,050
twelve months I think we'll start to see

01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:07,880
some some great outcomes of that well

01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:09,440
we'll have a more competitive user

01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,270
experience hopefully we'll have a better

01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,910
evaluator experience which is going to

01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:16,160
be great we're gonna make it easier for

01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:18,950
people to build maintain and upgrade

01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:20,450
their sites and we're gonna start

01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:22,370
promoting Drupal to non-technical

01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:24,230
decision-makers to hopefully grow

01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:27,380
adoption that way as well and then

01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:30,230
lastly as I said fostering the community

01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:33,020
is also going to be a priority for this

01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:34,460
year and we started today with values

01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:37,160
and principles and I think that's a

01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:39,290
foundational building block on which we

01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:44,300
can build and do a lot more work around

01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:46,940
these items so very excited about these

01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:48,650
things I think we've come a long way in

01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:51,440
those 17 years and I think we have

01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:55,070
actually a very bright future ahead of

01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,000
us and I'm excited to grow Drupal

01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:58,490
together with all

01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:11,890
