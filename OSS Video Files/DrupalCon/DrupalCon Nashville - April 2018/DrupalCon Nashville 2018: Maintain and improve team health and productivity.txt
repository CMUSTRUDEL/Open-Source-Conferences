Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	We only have 8 hours a day! I don’t believe this is true when you LOVE your WORK. And even if it were true, I would like to ensure my health and productivity are in perfect condition and efficiency is optimized with just 8 hours a day.

Being a Project Manager, managing multiple projects at a time, I used to find it extremely difficult to do EVERYTHING today. And while I was struggling with my own problems, I probably never realized - my teams were not in their best shapes. 

Fortunately, with experience and a lot of experimentation, I have learned to optimize my own productivity and thereafter discovered techniques to ensure THE TEAMS are healthy and happy.

Through this talk, I would like to share some of the simplest(yet ignored) ways to care for your teams and know what to fix and when to fix, If something is wrong.
