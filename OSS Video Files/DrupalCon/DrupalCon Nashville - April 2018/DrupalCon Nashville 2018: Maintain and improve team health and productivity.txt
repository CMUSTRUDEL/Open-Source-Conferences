Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Maintain and improve team health and productivity
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	We only have 8 hours a day! I don’t believe this is true when you LOVE your WORK. And even if it were true, I would like to ensure my health and productivity are in perfect condition and efficiency is optimized with just 8 hours a day.

Being a Project Manager, managing multiple projects at a time, I used to find it extremely difficult to do EVERYTHING today. And while I was struggling with my own problems, I probably never realized - my teams were not in their best shapes. 

Fortunately, with experience and a lot of experimentation, I have learned to optimize my own productivity and thereafter discovered techniques to ensure THE TEAMS are healthy and happy.

Through this talk, I would like to share some of the simplest(yet ignored) ways to care for your teams and know what to fix and when to fix, If something is wrong. 



OVERVIEW OF THE SESSION

Problems faced at the time of managing multiple projects/teams - examples that apply to almost all of us
How to deal with these problems?  Effective, tested sure-shot ways

	00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:18,720
okay hello everyone hey are you all here

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,670
for the right session it's a little

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,920
scary to see how so many people in a

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,420
session room but I'm glad you all came

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,060
okay so my name is rocky Montagna and I

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,700
work as a project manager at QED 42

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,219
based out of India and today I'm going

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,649
to talk about maintain and improve team

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,010
health and productivity while managing

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,770
multiple projects so let's quickly get

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,379
to know each other first let's do a who

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,120
is who with a show of hands maybe just a

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,320
roll check to see what kind of an

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,140
audience I have today okay so project

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,090
managers agile coach scrum masters

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,340
consultant product owners okay

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,479
developers architect webmasters chrome

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,890
rajaiah team members okay

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,970
director I hope nobody oh we do okay

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,500
okay

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,259
business development leaders business

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,390
managers okay great okay so at the onset

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,100
we don't all have to be project managers

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,580
to relate to what I'm going to talk

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,740
about today because in some walk of what

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,320
we do on a daily basis we end up

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,909
managing things or people and I think

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,740
there's always a scope for improvement

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,350
there are things that I can do better

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,450
with every passing day

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,340
so although most of my use cases will be

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,070
around project management and some of my

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,420
first-hand experiences I don't have the

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,549
winning mantra if that is what you are

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,950
here for but I'm going to talk a lot

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,040
from experience and how I handle certain

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,130
things okay

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,450
so do you all think you're leaders do we

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,649
have any leaders here I think all of us

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:06,960
some one or the other is following us

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:09,270
right so we are leading people so to

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,599
start with what ask for you is team

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,560
health just a short answer of what is

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,120
team health as we

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,180
like whatever you have whatever you

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,180
understand from team health anybody

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:27,770
without a mice is fine

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:36,230
okay what else

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:42,420
sorry okay anything else

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:45,260
the team likes a job okay okay and what

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,260
is productivity

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:58,010
okay continuous delivery getting work

00:02:52,850 --> 00:03:00,230
done try weighing okay so I'm sure there

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,950
are very good scientific and technical

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,020
definitions to both but I I'm just a

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,270
very simple person all I understand is

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,210
at the end of the day what matters is

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,730
that you're happy you love what you do

00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,680
you are good at it and you're happy at

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,280
the end of the day and when all these

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,470
three work in harmony that is when you

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,480
as a team member even if you're a leader

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,280
you're still a team member so you as a

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,980
team member you're healthy and you're

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,730
productive so all of these three have to

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,010
work together in harmony right so and

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,630
this is a question that actually came in

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,880
today morning as well I was speaking to

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,490
somebody and and that person asked me

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,800
how is project management related to

00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,990
team health and productivity like aren't

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,870
there people to do that people managers

00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,760
in organizations and I think nowadays

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,220
organizations have some really cool

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,830
roles as well like team health officers

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,140
and Happiness checking officers and and

00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,660
more such roles who are focus or

00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,690
focusing on people and their health and

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,520
productivity on a general basis but I

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,280
feel that it would be completely

00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,950
inappropriate or incomplete for a

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,650
project manager to not focus on these

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,600
aspects to not focus on a team's health

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,720
and productivity and just deliver

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,750
projects for the sake of doing it if you

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,240
take a trip to somewhere what do you

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,730
think of most or when you recall a trip

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,460
for that matter what you think of most

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,680
the journey are the point that you've

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:35,540
reached the journey okay when you

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,460
deliver a project do you remember the

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,170
project delivery dates or do you

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,070
remember the obstacles you faced in a

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:45,620
project yeah and how you overcame that

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,920
those are probably things to discuss and

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,160
boast about lessons learned right okay

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,180
so and personally I had this realization

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,430
that it's it's the key factor for me to

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,400
deliver a project successfully if my

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,120
team is healthy and productive so I was

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,400
working on something

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,310
years ago and I was I was buried under a

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,030
mountain of tasks and then one email

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,370
came in just one simple email that added

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,000
something to the list one extra thing

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,330
nothing to worry about but I was

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,810
overwhelmed I did not know how to react

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,389
and I just responded briskly to it I

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:30,150
definitely should not have done that and

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:33,540
I regret that today okay but that's how

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,220
I responded at that moment so for

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:40,830
instance if you if you throw a pebble

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:43,889
into a puddle of water what happens here

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,410
the ripples and it reacts depending on

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,289
the the mass of the pebble and the force

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,470
with which you threw it so appropriately

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:56,220
I wish I had that state of mind of water

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,199
to react appropriately not under react

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,949
not over react but just a fine

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:05,250
proportion and in that situation I had

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:07,410
some more questions if I am not happy

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,990
with what I'm doing and I'm not reacting

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,270
appropriately do I have the time to

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,180
check in with my team members if they

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,680
are happy at what they're doing are the

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,660
people who are working with me are they

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,030
fine is there something that I need to

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,099
be bothered about everybody's delivering

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,110
projects and there's no complaints

00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,669
everything is being done on time there

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,099
are a few hiccups here and there but at

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,150
the end it's good if it ends well right

00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:35,669
so is that the only thing that matters

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,710
probably not that's where the journey

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,960
comes in so this the destination is

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,389
definitely important but how you reach

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,400
there or how you manage a project is

00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,400
more important than just delivering it

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,210
so for all the project managers who are

00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,539
here I hope you agree with the fact that

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,789
it's not a piece of cake managing a

00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,919
project or working as a team member or

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:02,610
working as a leader none of this is

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,370
whatever we do we face difficulties the

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,940
simple mantra or the simple solution to

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,099
having a good happy healthy team is to

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,800
make sure you know what problems you are

00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:17,240
in how to deal with those problems and

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,280
then improvise so

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,850
the very basic concepts of agile tells

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,220
you to experiment inspect and adapt so

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,320
with every experiment that you do you

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,660
inspect what you've learned and then you

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,430
adapt yourselves as you move ahead so

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,370
everything is a lesson learned in some

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,560
way or the other so some of the problems

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,080
which I'm just pointing them down based

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,030
on my experience and my understanding

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,650
the problems that you face when you

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:48,090
manage one project I don't know if

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,010
you've all been in this situation where

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:54,090
you have so much to do but you're not

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:56,100
sure where to start you have time zone

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,750
communication gaps you want to convey

00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,490
something but you're blogged you can't

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,230
bring your person because he's in a

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,040
different time zone and you don't know

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,110
when to get get a response back

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,670
different velocity of team members

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,070
somebody is still chasing the tail while

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:15,360
somebody's at the head and the team is

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:17,430
falling out of sync confronting a team

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,420
members performance problem probably the

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,130
biggest nightmare of a project manager

00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,770
witnessing friction in team members you

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,880
sense that there's some friction but you

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,090
don't know how to how to solve it

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,410
realizing problems when it's very late I

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:38,490
don't know if all of you have been there

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:40,830
but I have definitely been there and you

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,990
see that the team's how workload there

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,670
are deadlines that needs to be met but

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,130
there's nothing that you can do about it

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:51,540
for XYZ reasons but you line into

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,860
situations like this then you have very

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,620
good team members there's a huge

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,120
diversity in your team as in everybody

00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,680
comes from different backgrounds

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,190
different experience level and even

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,560
different generations so all of these

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,050
are problems some of the problems and

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,640
this is again a very short list but some

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,420
of the problems that you face when you

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,080
manage one project now imagine doing

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:21,800
this for one more project or probably

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,899
two more for more five

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,160
okay I hope you don't have to cross that

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,620
but let's say you're doing it for five

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,019
more projects so all of those problems

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,760
multiplied by five is what you have to

00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:36,140
manage plus the difficulty increases

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,640
when you're managing multiple projects

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:43,070
because everything is priority one have

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,360
you ever set heard somebody say oh this

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,029
is not priority while this is probably

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,050
probably ten so don't even do it this is

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:54,160
priority one we have to get it done your

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:59,019
customers are all different time zones

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:02,149
all of your projects are equally complex

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:04,339
you don't know when and how to say no

00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:06,410
I'm sure you're all base with people and

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,920
it's really difficult to say no

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,920
especially to our immediate seniors or

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,829
supervisors like I can't I can't say no

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,839
it's difficult for me and then time

00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:19,850
crunch to deliver all the projects it's

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,560
not just one delivery that is important

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,300
every delivery is important and you have

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,510
to meet the time deadlines for each one

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,940
of those you start second-guessing your

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,930
limits sometimes you don't know if

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,970
you're even headed in the right

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,810
direction or you're not confident enough

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,670
whether I can do it and then not being

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,190
able to give each team member your

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,020
undivided attention

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,360
you are still managing multiple projects

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,760
so it's impossible to give everyone the

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,740
needed attention but these things are

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,720
important and in some way or the other

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,740
without you even realizing it it's

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,420
impacting your team's health capacity

00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,089
allocation hazards that's a very

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,290
interesting topic and so I will get to

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,450
it when we start discussing the

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,730
solutions but these are just some of the

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,260
very general problems that we face when

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,350
we have multiple things to do on

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,790
multiple projects to manage so all those

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,839
problems that you are facing when

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,130
managing one project x 5 plus this is a

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,680
set of problems you have to deal with

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,899
plus the work that you have to do plus

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,339
your team who is important enough that

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:27,170
you need to make sure that you maintain

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:30,709
their health right so would you like to

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,520
have the winning formula how sweet would

00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:35,370
it be if I just give away

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,110
a one-page document which says

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,170
everything and how to tackle any

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:43,110
situation you might ever land into the

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:45,210
sad news is there isn't one and I think

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,130
we all know that so one use case would

00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,050
not fit all one winning formula would

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,760
not fit all we all have our own use

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,180
cases we all have our own experiences

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,370
and we'll have to I'll try any more

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,310
generic but we'll eventually have to

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:03,540
make sure that it fits us our own use

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:06,480
case so we'll start with organizing

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,540
these problems into categories and then

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,460
diving into their solutions the reason

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,830
for organizing them into categories is

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,310
I'm not talking about the problems that

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,520
I have already faced I'm talking about

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,070
eventually

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,230
preparing a checklist based on the

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,750
categories that I mentioned because

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,090
those categories are where we somehow

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,910
falter and which is why we end up having

00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:33,000
problems and we end up losing the focus

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:35,970
from our teams so if we can focus on

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,780
categories and then depending on our own

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,610
use case prepare our own checklist for

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,650
every category have our project

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,490
guidebook or a project Bible in front of

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,440
our desk two things to see to every week

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,750
or before the start of every project and

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,230
things like that that would just be

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,010
wonderful

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,570
right so diving into categories the

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,100
first category that I have is

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,240
expectation setting okay

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,000
everything is priority one is a wrong

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,520
expectation to have and you as a project

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,160
manager or as a leader have to be a very

00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,540
good communicator to actually convince

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,170
someone that what they are saying is not

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,600
priority one and how you do that so for

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,780
instance I have to work on a project

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,550
where there are three pages and there

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,020
are five six different features on all

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,830
of those three four pages and everything

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,720
is important okay now here either I can

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,640
go back to my team and tell them you

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,830
have to do everything because everything

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,670
is probably one or I take a moment here

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:42,120
pause and reflect I go back to my client

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:46,110
and I tell them look why don't you try

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,610
and think what is going to be

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,930
more important in terms of your

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,700
end-users so think of which feature is

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,380
okay to be delivered slightly later and

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,060
what is it that will bring in more

00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,820
traffic to your website they're just one

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,070
parameter but it still is so what you're

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,079
doing is you are consulting you are

00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:08,640
training and you're educating your

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,529
client as consultants to for them to be

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,320
able to pick priorities because not only

00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,149
is it going to be cost effective in some

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,730
way or the other but also they have a

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:20,940
different different perspective to look

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,920
at it so because you dared to consult

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,040
because you dared to put a suggestion

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,829
forward what you came out with was a

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,560
checklist a prioritized list of the

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:34,110
tasks that you needed and your client's

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,779
trust because now the client knows that

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,550
you you're not just delivering something

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,260
for the sake of delivering it you really

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,940
are interested into it and you're trying

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,250
to pitch in suggestions that will make

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,589
the delivery better and smoother so if

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,660
you if you probably deliver the

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:51,000
important features first that's just

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,390
that gets in more confidence in some way

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,320
or the other

00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,029
right from the client then workload on

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,420
teams to me deadlines so this is also

00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:03,930
around expectations what I generally do

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,930
is I have I have a risk register for

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,510
every project that I do and every time

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,149
something or the other is adding to the

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,459
timeline it's a big risk to the project

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,860
so if I have weekly check-ins or

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:18,390
bi-weekly check-ins with my client then

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,250
I would make sure to put that risk

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,500
register on the agenda even if it is

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,839
blank if it is blank grade we just move

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,180
ahead and skip that agenda item but if

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,339
it has something you are constantly

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,399
feeding and updating the status without

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,829
explicitly stating it you are constantly

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,440
telling them that this blocker came in

00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:39,149
and we need more information on this I

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,339
have a feeling it's going to impact the

00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,320
deadline by two or three days what do

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,930
you think about it so you're having a

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,630
general conversation but again without

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,740
explicitly stating it you are given the

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,630
message that there's going to be a

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,120
slight impact on the timeline so either

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,520
we resolve this blocker right away or we

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,220
will have to push the deadline of it but

00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,939
in both the situation's by giving that

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,739
message you are

00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:04,279
not increasing the workload on the team

00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:07,529
so you spend more time planning and

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,569
reflecting on things so that you don't

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:11,459
end up putting your teams in situations

00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,349
where they have too much workload that

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:17,069
they cannot really handle in because

00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:18,779
what will happen if you still don't find

00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:20,999
a way and you still want to have them to

00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,609
have more workload what will happen is

00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:26,189
eventually either the quality of work

00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:28,739
would not be a hundred percent as it

00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:33,149
could be had they been doing it at their

00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:35,519
own pace or else you will end up you'll

00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:38,629
end up delivering a project but then

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,699
keeping your team's dissatisfied and

00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:44,309
these are small small things that

00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:47,759
accumulate and eventually burst out with

00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:49,619
either a star performer leaving or or

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,499
just having bad performance eventually

00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:54,779
so all of these are risks that you don't

00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:56,609
foresee right at the moment but you will

00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:59,009
eventually figure those out so it's

00:16:56,609 --> 00:17:00,929
important to make sure that you have

00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:03,539
this as a checklist item that whenever

00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:05,639
you see a flag a red flag which is going

00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,709
to impact time line or increase the

00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:09,929
workload on team members you have it in

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:11,370
your conversations your weekly check-ins

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:15,179
or your bi-weekly check-ins with the

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:17,220
client and then customers in all

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:21,149
different time zones another reason to

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,220
say no so if I'm based out of India and

00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:25,379
I have a customer who's based in Japan

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,679
that is four and a half hours ahead of

00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:30,960
me I have a customer based aid UK that's

00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,690
three and a half hours behind me I have

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,110
a customer based in u.s. who's twelve

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:40,169
hours ahead of me this means I end up

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,659
having a really long day even if I take

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:45,269
breaks I am actually working so I end up

00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:47,519
having a really long day and it's

00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:49,649
difficult for me to manage and I get

00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,799
frustrated if I get frustrated it's

00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:55,470
impossible to keep the team's happy so

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,629
the key factor here again come boils

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,450
down to you so you have to make sure

00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:03,350
that you say no this for yourself and

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,299
for your team members so you cannot have

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,490
team members also working for clients in

00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,830
different time zones there are often

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,779
cases where you have percentage

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:16,119
allocations for example so you want you

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:18,219
only need 50% capacity or 10 hours a

00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,559
week capacity of a vacuum developer on

00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:22,509
one project and then you need 20 hours

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,309
capacity on of a packet developer on

00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:26,950
some other project so you try and

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:28,929
allocate them without having the aerial

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,139
view of things without looking that

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,029
you've given one allocation as of that

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:36,129
time zone which is Japan based and one

00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,019
time zone that is US based so you're not

00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:40,450
really trying to make it work for them

00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:42,070
or for you yourself so that's where you

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,779
have to say known and you have to step

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,249
in and start looking at the aerial

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:47,019
picture rather than just looking at

00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,969
things when you're inside it because

00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:51,219
it's difficult to see through water I

00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:52,570
mean you're inside it so you have to

00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:54,129
make sure that you come out of it at

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,960
times and you try to look at the bigger

00:18:54,129 --> 00:19:01,269
picture as well and that team members

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,389
aren't getting your needed attention so

00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:06,909
I'm sure that all of us are organized in

00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:13,389
some way or the other but do we all have

00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:16,210
our calendars set in advance we do yeah

00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:18,129
ok so when you're managing multiple

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,769
projects it's important that you stick

00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:22,809
to your calendar as well it's very

00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,669
difficult to say no to a meeting when

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:26,200
it's over running by 5 minutes or 10

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,909
minutes because you are at an important

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,309
point and you don't want to skip it and

00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:32,440
you really want to discuss it today but

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,499
if you don't time box if you do not

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,299
stick to your calendar in that case you

00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:38,469
will event you will have to cross out

00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:41,679
the things that you feel are less

00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:43,719
important so urgent but not urgent and

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,950
not important so those kind of things

00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,389
you probably strike them off your

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,820
calendar and move them into the next day

00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:51,489
but if you have a very predefined

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,429
calendar which includes times or

00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:55,749
check-in times with your team members to

00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:58,479
make sure that they get your attention

00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:00,190
and share that calendar so you have to

00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:01,929
maintain that transparency of having

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,909
your calendar booked a week ahead and

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:06,159
then share that calendar with your team

00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:08,200
members well in advance so they know

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,599
when you are available and when is the

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,789
right time to ask questions so what this

00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:15,759
will have what this will do is it will

00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:17,440
bring in team discipline one they have

00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,839
to make sure that they utilize their

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,330
scrum calls or your daily check-in calls

00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,109
more proactively so they know that

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,509
you're not going to be available

00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:26,210
throughout the day which will make them

00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:29,090
come true

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,440
for your scrum meetings or for any daily

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,870
check-ins that you have whatever you

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,370
call it on a daily basis so they will

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,890
have to come prepared for the meetings

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,919
make sure they explicitly state their

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:43,490
the blockers and you have time blocked

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,799
on your calendar to resolve them so team

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,340
discipline and self-discipline both act

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,860
together

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,190
in this use case where team members do

00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,840
not get here divided your need attention

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,520
so that's how you organize it by by

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,799
making sure that you have calendar and

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,620
you have things two things to pay

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:04,220
attention to in your calendar nicely and

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,779
rightly reserved and then capacity

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,750
allocation hazards so this is again

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:11,840
around one of the use case that I often

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,600
come across as percentage allocations so

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,480
for example when you when you talk about

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,240
QA allocation on a project you have 50%

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,120
allocation on one project and 50% on

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,490
another do you have that like is anyone

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,419
who's have has such allocations okay

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,309
great

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,279
so if you have a percentage allocation

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,740
on projects so I had this huge case

00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,710
where one of my key ways was working on

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,860
two projects 50% each and then there was

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:44,149
a need to pitch in another 50% capacity

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,760
on project a so what we did instead of

00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:49,880
doing doing creating a blunder out of it

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,600
like adding a new new QA in 50% capacity

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,850
to project a we proposed moving the 50%

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,620
QA to hundred percent capacity taking

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,190
him out of project B and just letting

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:04,580
him work entirely on project a and let

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,289
the new QA be on project B this isn't a

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,919
big thing to do it was a very small

00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:13,279
thing but eventually the QA who was in

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,840
project a came and said it's very nice

00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,840
that I get to work on just one project

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,820
and there's no context switching anymore

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,100
it did not impact both the projects or

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,529
both the clients in any way they were

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,059
both happy the QA only had to work on

00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,000
one project there was no context

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:30,260
switching had I introduced one more QA

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,299
the context switching would have

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,280
continued the QA would have sensed that

00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,530
there was a possibility of me working on

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,440
project a but I I haven't been put on

00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,840
that so my allocation is all messed up

00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,160
and nobody speaks up because again it's

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,960
a problem that we don't realize it now

00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,630
but something that we will realize it

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,610
later so these kind of capacity

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,710
allocation hazards should also be

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,020
avoided in the best way and and these

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,070
are again use case specifics so you have

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,380
to make sure that you understand what

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,360
the use cases in and take a moment to

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:05,500
reflect on how you can resolve that use

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:07,480
case okay next is time realizing

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,540
problems when it's very late so I have a

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,880
very good example of this one and so on

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,050
one of my projects so we were doing

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,420
sprints as and we were doing two

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:22,120
week-long deliveries and with every

00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,120
sprint there were two or three tasks

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,310
that were moving to the next sprint okay

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,320
so if I look at it it's not that big of

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,660
a deal because when we do the project

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,700
retrospect er we find out that it's

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,250
because the requirements was not clear

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,290
in the first sprint in the second frame

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,410
sprint the same thing happened and this

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,730
time it happened because there was there

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,070
was a blocker which could not have been

00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,800
identified at the beginning and the

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,180
third sprinted happened due to the

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,190
developer not asking the right question

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,580
at the right time so there was reason

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:57,640
for everything but even I did not look

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,620
at these delays being a consistent

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,170
activity so he was happening every

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,270
sprint by Sprint right so at the end of

00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,340
the fourth sprint I thought it's

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,780
probably a developer issue it's a

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,270
problem with the skill with the

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,910
efficiency and then I spoke to my

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,500
technical architect and I said I think

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,030
somebody needs to talk to him there's

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,710
some problem because all of my Sprint's

00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,220
are getting delayed and it's not working

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:24,220
out so he suggested let us let him and

00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,750
me have a look at some of the stories

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,490
that he had to work on the previous

00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,750
sprints some of the problems that he

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,090
mentioned explicitly in his

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,300
retrospective and see what could have

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,640
happened when we did that what we

00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,060
analyzed was it wasn't a skill problem

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,220
it was an estimation problem but again

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,520
not due to skill so what was happening

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,530
is at the time when he was doing the

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,530
technical grooming so before the start

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,880
of the sprint we have a day or two -

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,650
technically groom to us

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,440
so when he was doing the technical

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:59,140
grooming he was probably spending 15

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,510
minutes for grooming but had he spent 15

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,210
more minutes and spent a little more

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,610
time on grooming the technical approach

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,460
would have been figured out into end and

00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,810
that blocker which he came which he

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,000
identified in the middle of the sprint

00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,610
he wouldn't have fallen into that

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,420
situation plus his estimate would have

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:22,870
been more accurate so to look at this

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,570
again it wasn't a scale problem even the

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:28,090
developer did not know that there was a

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,190
problem with with the technical grooming

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,050
he also at the same time thought that

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,840
I'm not able to do justice to the

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,130
project or to the sprint and this

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,380
conversation could have gone into a

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,270
whole different level of us taking

00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,040
strict actions against the developer or

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,290
getting them back into training and all

00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,810
that but instead it all worked out with

00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,970
just one small call with the developer

00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,100
and telling him that how he could do the

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:55,090
technical grooming better he eventually

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:56,560
started doing that and the example that

00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,590
I mentioned I also have my client in my

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,350
room but he eventually started doing

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,940
that and it worked like a charm there

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,890
were no delays everything was getting

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,800
delivered on time he became more

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,780
confident he became happier that he was

00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,420
able to commit to something and deliver

00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,910
it because there wasn't any problem with

00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,980
anything at all but when I look at the

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,660
aerial view again I realized what the

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,080
problems were about the problems could

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,680
have been so here that it's still never

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,020
too late

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,850
whatever we learn it's a learning so the

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,260
lesson that I learned out of it was to

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,710
have this kind of a checklist so

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,270
whenever I see an activity or something

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,670
happening again and again like

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,560
consistently the root cause doesn't

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,180
always have to be what I am thinking and

00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,210
that's where a third persons opinion

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,790
matters so whenever we have problems we

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,760
should probably identify the cause of it

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,410
and then try to fix them even if we

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,030
realize it late so that it doesn't

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,170
happen again with the same person or

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:57,700
with some other person in future and

00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,620
then all of your projects are equally

00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,460
complex another situation where you say

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,750
no so if I have a sprain zero supering

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,660
zero for me as

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:10,810
a sprint that I do before I even get

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,820
into the project so I start analyzing

00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,900
the fun the requirements and I gather

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,900
more details around that

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,750
so before I if I'm in spring zero for

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,130
one sprint for one project I should not

00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,620
be in the sprint zero for any other

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,380
project so all of my projects with equal

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,700
complexity and the same phase for all

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,980
the projects that's just going to be

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,700
very difficult to manage so what I can

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:37,450
do is when I said calendar it also meant

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,070
capacity calendar we do capacity

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,380
allocation for developers for the team

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,830
members right do we do capacity

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,910
allocation for ourselves

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,530
probably the higher management does it

00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,580
for us or I don't know how it works for

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:54,700
everyone but if we have our own capacity

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,860
calendars wherein we because we know

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,840
what stage a project is going to be in

00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,310
in a certain week and we know that we

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,590
are going to need 10 hours for this

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,780
project 20 hours for that project based

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,790
on our understanding if we have that

00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,970
kind of a capacity calendar and we can

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:12,370
share it with our with our immediate

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,840
supervisors or our seniors whoever is

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,750
going to take the decision on project

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,780
allocations and let them know that this

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,640
is looks like a risk for the next week

00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,680
because I've already planned to spend 30

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,570
hours or 40 hours on something I

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,680
definitely don't have more bandwidth to

00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:31,360
take up anything else right and then

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,600
time crunch to deliver all projects so

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,610
this is also in a way related so all of

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,650
these are interwoven and these are all

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:41,380
related so time crunch to deliver all

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,260
projects also can be tackled by having

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,220
constant active communication of delays

00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,260
so the risk register concept and yeah

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,670
the concept of risk register and making

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:54,220
sure that you put it as an agenda item

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,530
every time you discuss something with

00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,570
your clients that just make sure that

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,420
you don't fall into a time crisis

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,890
situation when you plan that's where you

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,950
need to spend in more time rather than

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,320
spending time during a sprint resolving

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,480
blockers if you plan well and you plan

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,400
in advance plus you communicate any

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,090
impacts to the plan rather than giving a

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,160
certain surprise a few weeks later maybe

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,800
have constant check-ins and

00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,630
make sure that whatever you say that's

00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,550
transparent enough and has data to

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,560
support what are you saying so you have

00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:29,460
that transparency when you communicate

00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,460
with your client

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,110
next set of categories capabilities so

00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:39,550
confronting a team members performance

00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:42,700
problem so I I work in a company where I

00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:44,650
deal with a lot of lot of young people

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:49,270
in the sense that I deal with a lot of

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:52,480
energy and youth right so which makes

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:55,720
them prone to making mistakes more as

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,580
well and so there are different age

00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,680
groups or different generations of

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,200
people who are within the organization

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,730
but the people who are more prone to

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,770
mistakes are those who probably not have

00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,620
the right experiences or haven't made

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,270
any mistakes to learn from them so when

00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,460
you have to confront a team members

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:15,390
performance problem you have to make

00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:19,480
sure you do it this depending on what

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:24,760
experience level or what generation do

00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,410
they fall in because until unless you

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,680
don't can be the message in the right

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,390
way it's not going to it's not going to

00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,790
be productive enough for you as well to

00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,920
make sure that the team member grows and

00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,900
works properly so when you're talking

00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,250
about team health here so when you

00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,960
confront somebody about their

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,090
performance problem you have to make

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,700
sure that you do it very elegantly and

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,830
you do it in a way that it's not really

00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,420
putting up putting your finger on

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,430
someone or pointing pointing somewhere

00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,010
out but instead it's more about trying

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,540
to understand just be a good listener at

00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,670
that point of time try to understand

00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,920
what is wrong and what is it that they

00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,750
could have done differently or what is

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,640
it that you can do best to serve them

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,440
when they see that you are really

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,680
interested in what they have to offer

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,610
that is when they will also start

00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:16,390
working towards improving themselves

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:18,190
right so this is also related to the

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,900
second point which is different velocity

00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,900
of team members and people fall out of

00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,000
sync not everybody has the same capacity

00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,370
not everybody does work in the exact

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,310
same fashion and you probably need to

00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,880
educate your team's to not have the hero

00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,580
syndrome

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,800
so the hero syndrome is where you know

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,080
as I have team members where I have

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,450
really enthusiastic team members and

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,220
they can't sleep at night without

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,740
completing their work and they end up

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,170
spending a lot of time while there are

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,520
other team members who who respect the

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,830
professional personal work-life balance

00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,450
and they do their things on their time

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:57,080
but then they do they don't spend extra

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:59,660
hours so if I see if I look at this as a

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,850
client I would probably see this team

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,370
member is doing a lot this team member

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,170
is not doing a lot this means that

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,970
there's a scale problem or there's an

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,760
efficiency problem or there's a

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:13,940
performance problem but actually it's

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,430
not so here we need to educate our team

00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,100
members and make sure that they do it

00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:21,080
right and they do not overdo themselves

00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,220
it's always good you don't stop your

00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,410
team members when they like to do

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,780
something but you also communicate not

00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:29,030
to set the right wrong expectations so

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,560
you don't want because of the different

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,970
team members velocities you don't want

00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,700
to give away the wrong message to your

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,380
clients that I have a different skill

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,730
set of team members and not everybody is

00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,890
efficient enough to do their work on

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:47,510
time so that's where expectation

00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:53,060
settings come in okay I just wrap up in

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:55,370
two minutes okay okay so I think

00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,340
confidence wise all of this falls in

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:04,370
place when you don't have to so when you

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:07,790
have your planning done well so we

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,650
talked about yeah yeah I will definitely

00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:14,150
post it online I think I'll add in some

00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:16,070
notes as well so you can look at it yeah

00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,850
so just one important point I think

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:21,110
which I would like to conclude with is

00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,420
when you have to maintain team health

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,720
and productivity you have to make sure

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,890
that you block time spend time on

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,280
getting to know your team members and

00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,960
celebrating them until unless you have a

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,970
personal connect until unless you have

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,220
the human touch with them you would not

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:42,080
be able to make sure that your teams are

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,760
healthy and performing well so with this

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,539
I'll just conclude the session because

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,989
the next speaker is

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:49,249
but I will post the slides online and

00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:51,129
I'll also add in some of the notes

00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:54,139
because these are all bullet points but

00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:55,350
I'll add the points so that you can look

00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,330
at it

00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,420
[Applause]
