Title: DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Productizing your agency: creating self-sustaining revenue streams
Publication date: 2018-04-11
Playlist: DrupalCon Nashville - April 2018
Description: 
	As Drupal continues to grow, we encounter an increasing amount of adjacent technologies with which we must assimilate. This ever-evolving technology landscape provides us web creators the opportunity to become niche specialists, and even build and sell solutions around our expertise and interests.



In this talk, we explore how the Drupal community consumes products, how to grow an agency from within it, and how to build strategic partnerships to create a differentiated, and profitable, product and service.



As the CEO of Cellar Door Media, Chris saw a need for API and encryption key management as a service. The result was Lockr, the first hosted API & encryption key management for modern CMS’s like Drupal and WordPress. We will use Chris’s experience as a case study for building a product at an agency.



As a Partner Manager at Pantheon, Ben has worked with many agencies who have built and sold Drupal distributions and paid plug-ins to create a steady streams of revenue that adds to their business goals.



We will use our collective experience to convey the following lessons:



How Drupal’s maturation lead to the opportunity to build a new product

How to identify and attract new clients

How to create mutually beneficial relationships with technology partners

How expanding into new products, services, and industries has affected our businesses

Mistakes we made and how we would have done things differently

How will we make this profitable?

How do you sell TO Drupal? (instead of selling Drupal to others)

so welcome to Music City hope you're

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,710
enjoying the first day at DrupalCon I

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,139
just wanted to call out some famous

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,799
musicians that are from Nashville and

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,940
the surrounding areas we have some of

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,160
the three 6 mafia Miley Cyrus

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,160
there's also has anyone heard of lucky

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,869
number 7 band

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,380
anyone they're a lesser-known band from

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,109
the Nashville area with lead guitarist

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,200
handsome Ben you got the nickname

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,320
handsome because of how modest he was

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,590
and backup vocals was Chris blue blue

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,989
eyes title which I have to admit I'm the

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,460
better-looking one of the two but I'm

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,489
better at Photoshop

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,260
so they experienced some great success

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,649
early on in their careers so they sold

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,320
out the Grand Old Opry awesome Music

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,960
Hall in the city seats thousands of

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,750
people however they also had small

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,719
venues sometimes so they had to play a

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,960
smaller venue as conference room 205 C

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,159
of the Music City Center not that

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,049
there's anything wrong with that but it

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,220
just doesn't bring as much revenue into

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,140
this band and some weeks Chris couldn't

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,360
even get paid by Ben because the

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,250
overhead cost was the same but they

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,320
weren't bringing in as much money from

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,150
some of these smaller shows some of that

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,130
overhead I mentioned was a nightly

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,030
whiskey bath so this kept handsome Ben's

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,189
skin nice and rejuvenated but he he had

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,259
an idea one night which was instead of

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,540
emptying the whiskey bath and then

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,450
drawing a new one every single night he

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:47,340
could bottle up said whiskey and sell it

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,350
at shows a little uh this is lucky

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,649
number seven bands whiskey that they

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,140
sold at their concerts and this created

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,469
a great success for them because they

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,030
were able to provide a better experience

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,829
for fans they found that the more

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,290
whiskey the fans drank the more they

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,810
enjoyed the shows and thus they were

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,369
more likely to buy tickets to future

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,190
concerts so it actually made the fans

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,170
happier and it also accelerated lead

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,560
retention for

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,610
there audience members so you get where

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,520
we're going with this we're talking

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,599
about productizing your agency how many

can make my wrist vibrate during this

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,959
during this session so I've been at

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,730
Pantheon three years and my first two

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,650
years there I was a partner manager so

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,769
my job was to go across the nation and

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,840
talk to developers and agency owners

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,850
about their business and so I'll be

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,859
walking through some case studies of

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,480
really successful products that I've

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:27,739
seen in the WordPress and Drupal

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,209
community from that experience and then

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,579
I'll give a little bit of background I

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,120
have an agency seller of media that we

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:37,280
started in 2009 and we just released a

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,130
product about two years ago called

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,930
Locker so for those of you that have

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,480
products we can commiserate and those

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,549
that you about to embark on that journey

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,190
I can give you some tips and tricks on

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:55,209
how to avoid some of the pitfalls so

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:57,920
Pantheon does is a WordPress and Drupal

00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,510
platform for developers so I have

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,090
experience in both of those worlds I've

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,180
found that you know there's the adage

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,880
that you're not to sell Drupal but sell

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,549
to Drupal or self from Drupal and I I

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,380
totally understand that but there's also

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,420
something to be said of building an

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,510
economy around Drupal and I think that

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:21,380
those who are more totalitarian about

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,659
not selling Drupal are actually limiting

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,670
the growth of Drupal and thus hurting

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:27,220
Drupal and

00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,980
that my point here is that you shouldn't

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,530
feel bad about making money off the hard

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,870
work that you do and some of the most

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,540
successful agencies I've seen over the

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,910
years the ones who have doubled their

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,530
team in size are ones that have found

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,420
creative ways to package up what they're

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,830
doing in terms of either process or

00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:50,860
people and and repeat that across at

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,170
scale so one great way to do that is

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,910
with a custom custom upstream there's a

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:59,710
custom distribution or custom theme for

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,570
example a lot of agencies that work with

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,270
universities have found great ways to

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,070
use one single repository for code and

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,280
use that for all of the university sites

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,410
so ASU has a custom distribution called

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,860
web spark that they use for 2,000 sites

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,020
and it empowers the central the IT

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,670
managers to push out code and innovation

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,920
to all of these projects really

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,830
efficiently but they can also customize

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,810
on a per site basis in the Drupal

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,980
community level 10 is an agency in

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,470
Dallas Texas

00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,570
Tom McCracken is floating around the

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,790
conference here you can find him but he

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,640
created a custom distribution called

00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,680
open enterprise and this was a this is a

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,780
free distribution as as it should be but

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,660
there was services added on to that that

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,570
allowed him to really grow his business

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,730
from the last three years to double in

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,460
size by using the same set of marketing

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,500
functionality in open enterprise for all

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,500
of his clients and one of the things

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,230
that a note on this is that there is a

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,090
giant graveyard of companies who have

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,750
tried to come in and just throw money

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:07,990
and sales at Drupal in trying to

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,180
commoditize Drupal itself there have

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,670
been floated ideas of app stores and all

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,230
sorts of stuff and that all just got

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,240
very very very strong backlash from the

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,980
community other communities such as

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,810
WordPress and others have a very strong

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,870
and robust ecosystem around them for

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,330
paid themes paid modules Drupal doesn't

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,100
so if your agency is looking to build a

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,690
paid module or a paid theme where

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,840
somebody has to pay you money just in

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,030
order to install it you've got a rough

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,380
road ahead and and we'll want to talk

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,600
through some of the ideas that you have

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,230
but one way that you can use this to

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,090
your advantage

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,680
and actually do make a product off of it

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,400
is by creating something like a distro

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,280
or theme I myself got my start in Drupal

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,800
with the Omega theme I helped out early

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,720
on with the Omega theme and though I

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,520
wasn't one of the core maintainer z' of

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,380
it and though I wasn't one of obviously

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,390
Omega was free and everybody got to use

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,960
it and a lot of people did on Drupal 7

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,030
the start of my agency came from being a

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,190
service provider primarily to people

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,850
implementing that theme or that

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,530
distribution and so if you're looking at

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,880
building an open theme or an open

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:17,890
distribution it is a way that you can

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,540
create a product like revenue inside

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,580
your inside your agency because you can

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,470
then sell the services and the add-ons

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,510
to that product while the core of it

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,220
still remains free and open source which

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,470
the Drupal community appreciates and

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,380
this is actually another that's a good

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,350
segue to another type of products that

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,850
I've seen really successful in the both

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,780
in the Drupal and WordPress communities

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:43,000
but the best example I could think of is

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,500
agency called valet that does mostly

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,320
WordPress but a bit of Troop --all

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,020
they've created valley matrix is

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,460
basically just a free plugin that you

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,100
can add to any of your sites and it

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,380
creates useful information about how you

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,480
could optimize speed and performance and

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,920
usability of your website and then of

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,750
course if you would like a valet to

00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,370
improve that site in specified ways then

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,220
they of course will bill you for that

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:13,560
work and so I've seen this method super

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,560
successful in both Drupal and WordPress

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,510
and then the last one there's a lot of

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,730
these is like internal their

00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,310
productivity sort of products in fact

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,280
the last speaker Chris was mentioning

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,690
that they have some internal legal sort

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,720
of tool that they've built but a lot of

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,820
agencies are doing things for for local

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,880
development or for internal

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,390
communication and processing and two

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,160
examples are outrigger is phase twos

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,620
local development solutions so that they

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,300
can build the same way for all of their

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,880
projects and then deploy to the end host

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,080
wherever that may be and then a similar

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,260
set of local

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,240
and tooling by four kitchens is called

00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,340
aquifer but there's a lot of these out

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,010
there local development solutions seems

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,320
to be something that is a bit amiss in

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,790
in the development of communities and so

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,910
there's been a need to build internal

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:10,570
tooling that you know helps them

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:13,240
standardize their processes and this is

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,760
still like a great use of productizing

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,970
in an agency because it allows them to

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,920
be more efficient and scale up their

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:26,950
client base by developing the same way

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:28,960
each time so what's what's the secret

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,710
sauce like what do many of these

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,670
products and tools have in common a few

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,110
of them I think at the core of it all of

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,560
these agencies we're trying to think

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,770
about specialization what are you good

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,870
at

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,740
what are your clients consistently

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,510
asking for and acknowledging like trying

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,480
to think of what your agency is better

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:57,040
at than anyone else will lead you to

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,610
creating some sort of products that well

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,030
serves your clients all of these also

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,470
solve a problem so obviously agencies

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:10,560
were trying to think of better ways to

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:13,240
do things for their clients and yeah

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,610
that also like offloading menial chores

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,310
so Chris will talk a bit more about this

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,100
like scratching your own itch but if

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,290
there's something that's taking up a lot

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,240
of time in project cycles then trying to

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,070
find a creative way to offload that is

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,280
another way that agencies have thought

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:33,190
about productizing

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,960
yeah so so when I when I look at the the

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,920
special sauce and and how do you

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,380
specialize in something as an agency

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,450
like like Chris was talking about before

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,790
you do kind of find that market fit of

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,010
what you do best right and if you're

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,530
looking to create a product my highest

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,510
recommendation is scratch your own itch

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,340
because not only are you going to make

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,080
something that is valuable for you and

00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,060
your agency you're also gonna make

00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,020
something that you know very well you're

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,120
not going to go out and try to do

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,370
something completely random

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,470
I don't cut hair I'm not really good at

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,940
it and so when I go to my my hair

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,380
stylist they I sit down they say what do

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,880
you want I go I don't care you're the

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,830
you're the expert you do what you do

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,810
best I do what I do best and I think

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,490
that as agencies if we can do that in

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,140
our products and we come out with

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,770
products that we know best and scratch

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,250
our ownage

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,840
it allows us to look at it from a

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,700
product from a different light as well

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,860
because we are also the consumers of our

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,210
product and if you don't need your own

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,690
product why would somebody else need it

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,890
right and like I said you're benefiting

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,450
your agency you're making yourself more

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,990
productive you're you're standardizing

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,940
your toolset a bit but then you also get

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,260
to grow those internal skills and you

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,900
might actually be finding yourself

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,230
getting more work more sustainable work

00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,480
on your agency on your services side

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,820
rather not just from the product sales

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,580
for implementing and supporting your

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,250
product so it can actually add

00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:02,620
additional revenue there as we mentioned

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:06,430
earlier sell to Drupal don't don't sell

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,960
to Drupal instead sell from Drupal and

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,080
I've walked a couple of companies

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,400
through this not my own as they've come

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,020
to me and asked like how do i how do I

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,150
get my product into Drupal and how do I

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,560
get Drupal to consume my product and the

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,620
first thing I tell them is don't sell to

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,480
Drupal Drupal developers in the

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,460
community in general are typically more

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,880
advanced developers and they're more

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,460
technology savvy they can sniff out Bs

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,780
really really fast and they'll call you

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,370
on it and so unless you're good at

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,700
talking tech with folks you're going to

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,830
cut yourself flat-footed but they value

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,110
the tech and the code like I mentioned

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,630
earlier with the the app store idea and

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,160
all that open source values are very

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,010
very strong in the Drupal community and

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,030
so if you try to somehow get creative

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,170
and say I'm gonna go around that a

00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,030
little bit or I'm gonna try to do this

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,610
or that you'll get called out on it

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:57,720
you'll get called out really hard and

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,520
and because of this and because of our

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,770
our closeness but also the way that we

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,050
develop our technology we have a certain

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,060
level of trust of the community and so

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,220
if you want to gain that trust of a

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,230
consumer the best way to do it is to be

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,460
standing alongside them not in front of

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,920
them

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,480
or you know projecting yourself and

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,710
saying you should use my product but I

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,830
don't even use it I don't even know how

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,300
you would use it so how do you do this

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,750
participate in the community sponsor

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,320
events go to camps talk be involved not

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,720
just from a sales perspective most of

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,190
the time that I talk at camps I'll be

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,779
like yeah I have Locker and then I'll go

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,399
into something else because I don't want

00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,990
to make the talk about me or my company

00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,540
or my product I want to make it about

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,070
how we as a community can get better and

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,040
you can start building that trust

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,420
amongst the community and then the other

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,130
thing that we found and we've seen

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,660
repeated over and over again is build

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,370
your product to be extensible because

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,390
again Drupal are technical folks they're

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,040
going to take your product they're gonna

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,380
hack it they're gonna build on it

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,779
fYI it's open source they can do that

00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,670
and so enable that

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:01,950
don't try to don't try to quash that or

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,690
say well I don't want you moving my

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,330
product or anything like that and the

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,930
great example of this is and this will

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,350
be a very full group of hands here how

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,600
many people have used backup and migrate

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,160
everybody and did you know that there is

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,589
also a product next to it called node

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,020
squirrel yes and how do we know that

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,910
product because we all loved the backup

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,470
in migrate module and oh by the way if

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,029
you wanted this nice little add-on where

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,160
you didn't know where to put your backup

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:32,670
notes girl would keep that backup for

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,279
you that's a great example of creating a

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,900
product from the community and then

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,390
having a way to monetize it with a

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,589
separate product or a separate service

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,050
we've used that and modeled that and how

00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,850
we did Locker we've contributed a couple

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,100
of modules that have absolutely nothing

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,080
to do with locker but they provide some

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,790
of the underpinnings but they also allow

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,200
people to go use a competitor if they

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:56,370
want because I want to be able to give

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,440
them that extensibility and the other

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,959
thing that's been really beneficial for

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,660
us is learning from others getting off

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,950
the island one of the more impactful

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,870
things I would say that we've done for

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,690
our product in the last couple of years

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,880
is that we've actually gone in into the

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,220
WordPress world and we've launched a

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,950
WordPress version coding for WordPress

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,390
completely different than coding for for

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,800
Drupal it's a completely different

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,260
framework a completely different set of

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,000
skills and so it makes you look at your

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,890
product in different ways

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,810
and then also

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,340
though just the communities in general

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,450
like I said Drupal is a very technical

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,890
very enterprise level and and typically

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,220
more advanced developers and more

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,640
advanced users WordPress everything they

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,410
want is click click to install click to

00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,570
configure click to this everything's

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,190
driven in the UI and that's not a bad

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,450
thing at all and you can actually learn

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,880
from other communities and learn from

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,370
other products outside of our island and

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,170
bring that into Drupal and we saw that

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,700
today at the DRI's note where you no

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,140
more drag and drop and everything's

00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,090
starting to get more layout builder II

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,800
that's great because that's expanding

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,170
our island and allowing us to do more

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,150
and by doing that you're taking your

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,670
product and you're moving it just

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,350
outside of the Drupal bubble exposing

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,540
you to new markets new opportunities

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,790
that can then have a lot of cross sales

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,680
because face it you know believe it or

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,810
not and most of you are agency owners so

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,700
you know this not everyone does Drupal

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,530
anymore just Drupal people are doing

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,600
Drupal and right and if you can make

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,310
your product for Drupal and then you can

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,660
start capturing more of the business of

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:32,120
the people that you're working with this

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,830
is just kind of a tip from internally

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,050
and I've heard this said over and over

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:39,020
again by my my board and my current

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,540
investors is agency financing is the

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,430
cheapest financing you'll ever find

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,690
you're not deleting your company and

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,220
you're able to bootstrap do everything

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,010
internally so my biggest recommendation

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,440
is as you're building this product and

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,910
you're trying to figure out how do i how

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,290
do i start it how do i bootstrap it how

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,150
do I get the funds in order to make this

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,860
happen I have to take a developer off of

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,290
paid projects and turn them into just

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,820
developing product well that's going to

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,100
cost you money how do you do that you

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,890
you use the the income that's coming in

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:10,010
from your from your agency and you don't

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,780
have to seek out external funds and

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,070
that's going to be much much better down

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,510
the road once you've built up the

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,700
product you're going to be in a position

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,280
for when you do have to go get financing

00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,510
or you do have to split off or you know

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,890
lucky you you're starting to get

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,650
acquired or somebody wants to merge you

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,090
in you haven't diluted yourself along

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:30,140
the way just trying to get the money to

00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:32,810
start the business up but hindsight is

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:36,020
always 20/20 and so these are some of

00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,059
the things that I learned and I want to

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,860
pass along as

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,110
part of what what I learned in creating

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,360
Locker first thing is code for scale but

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,570
planned for realistic growth you may hit

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,830
the homerun and you may not but I will

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,960
tell you and this is actually come up in

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,539
the last week decisions that we made

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,710
eight months ago a year ago and in the

00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:57,070
way that we were going to architect

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,470
things and scale are helping us now and

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,360
and so even though you may want to get

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,519
the MVP out and you want to push that

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,870
out as fast as you can plan for scale

00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,009
because at some point you're going to

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,269
have that scale and you don't want to

00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:09,490
get caught flat-footed a year from now

00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:11,080
and saying oh crap I got to go rebuild

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,399
the entire underpinnings of my product

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,249
because it doesn't scale in this fashion

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:17,080
at the same time you know if people

00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,940
aren't dialing you the day one that you

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,470
launch the product don't freak out it

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,590
happens it's a slow growth and you'll

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,149
get there the next one is document your

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,830
Docs to document to document document

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:28,779
document just document everything

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,220
because you know your product really

00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,899
well you're an agency you're

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,570
implementing it right you're building it

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:37,330
and you are the expert on it not

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,409
everyone else is right and so I'll get

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,080
questions and be like oh yeah that's

00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,460
this crap it's not in the docs like I'm

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,230
always having to go back and figure out

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,210
like why why isn't this in the docs oh

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,070
where is this in the docs and I wish I

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,960
would have been more proactive early on

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,970
in my product in building out those

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,740
documentation to avoid some of the easy

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,779
mistakes that folks were using when

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,190
they're implementing it and this is the

00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:00,580
last one and this is the most important

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,080
and I I wish I could tell you the silver

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,480
bullet or the answer I have and I don't

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,710
I'm still working through it myself but

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,299
as an agency owner you're kind of in

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,129
this teeter-totter you have your agency

00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,600
and you have your product and your

00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,889
agency will do really well and your

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,999
product will suffer and your product

00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,740
will do really well in your agency will

00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:16,629
suffer and if you're the owner of the

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,379
agency like I am you're having to split

00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:22,389
your time amongst both don't lose focus

00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:23,590
just because your agency is is screaming

00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:25,559
for your help

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,299
don't forget your product and vice versa

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:30,639
our agency was lucky enough to see a 3x

00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,730
growth last year which is awesome

00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:35,379
but in doing that it took away from my

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,509
ability to focus on the product because

00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:39,700
I had to then scale and grow a company

00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,860
that was just going crazy right and so

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,330
that's a thing that I just want to

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,429
highlight that this is going to be

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:49,690
necessary for you to take a look at and

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:50,650
so you know as you're as you're going

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,560
through this if you're look

00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:56,440
getting at it you know keep your focus

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,000
to make sure that you take your mental

00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,830
breaks that's another thing that I would

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,020
highly recommend but make sure you you

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,670
at least visualize that teeter-totter

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,260
and every time you're spending time with

00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,820
your agency you're not spending on your

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,320
product and vice versa and at some point

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,790
those two are gonna hit a point where

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,260
they can no longer exist and that's when

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:15,850
you break them apart and you've got two

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:18,820
separate companies so with that I

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,160
believe we've got maybe a couple of

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,450
minutes for Q&A feel free to hit us on

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Twitter as well or just find us around

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:36,040
the conference we'd be happy to answer

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:39,310
any questions there's a microphone up

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,840
here you want to use it this is being

00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:44,740
recorded if you don't want to use the

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,660
microphone I can repeat as well hey

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,430
Chris how's it going man good good so uh

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,680
I was really interested to hear about

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,060
your experience working with Omega and

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,360
how business developed from there was it

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,810
organic or do you guys push for it I

00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,250
know it was very organic and it was very

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,040
long long story of how that all went

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,070
about but basically I started I didn't I

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:09,250
started my agency and and like Chris

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,170
said earlier it was very slow at the

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,300
beginning if you will as most agency

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,290
owners know so I had a lot of time on my

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,910
hands I got involved in the

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,410
documentation and support around Omega

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,670
and then one day they said hey we're

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,680
gonna put your name on the project page

00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,970
because you've contributed so much thank

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,100
you awesome

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,040
now you're on the project page of the

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,390
number one theme in Drupal email started

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,940
coming in people like oh my gosh I need

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,710
to make a help and we went from you know

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,170
working with small startups and and

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,610
universities to fortune 50 sites in like

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,340
a couple of weeks because people are all

00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,200
of a sudden needing a lot of help so

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,510
again that's we're contributing to

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,690
Drupal for not the sake of your product

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,640
or whatever you want to do can read tons

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,470
of rewards in the future and you're kind

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,390
of you're betting on yourself in that in

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,970
that sense it's awesome thank you yeah I

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:57,220
know like chapter three to experienced a

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,870
surge of business after they contributed

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,200
so much to be eight they were then

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,580
referred to for any big d eight projects

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,090
they were kind of the go-to shop for

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,130
that

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:35,620
so I think investing in the open-source

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:37,809
community is likely to pay off so Drupal

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,899
is a service so the question is how do

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,580
you how do you build something that

00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:45,070
isn't necessarily for Drupal but it's

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,419
built on Drupal right okay

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,100
that's a great question that comes up a

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:49,870
lot of the times there are a lot of

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,510
great sass companies that you may not

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,980
know running Drupal underneath and there

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,059
are a lot of Drupal companies that are

00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,559
actually using things like Drupal

00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,940
commerce to run all of the e-commerce

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,880
stuff behind them that you may not know

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,409
which is why sometimes you can sit there

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,399
and like read the error message is

00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:05,890
coming out you're like I know where that

00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:08,140
error message comes from totally fine

00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,549
totally legal do it because you're

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,149
building it on a product that you know

00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:17,320
you can extend and you can work with so

00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:19,480
the the licensing and everything behind

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,730
Drupal allows you to build a product off

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,260
of it you don't necessarily have to if

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,669
you're selling it as a service to

00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,380
somebody somebody's using that you don't

00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,779
have to obviously give them the code for

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,279
it but if you are wrapping it up into a

00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:31,630
product and selling it then under the

00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,260
open-source agreement you would have to

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,549
give them the the source code for it

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,440
that being said there's there's a great

00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:43,299
example of like rumah five in the rooms

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,220
module to manage hotels and an air beam

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:46,299
like kind of like an air B&B if you

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,419
wanted to run your own little air B&B

00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:51,460
off of a property they've done that

00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:54,039
they've basically taken Drupal and they

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,570
can host your Airbnb site for you or

00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:00,190
your your little vacation rental for you

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,590
so yeah I would I would say go for it do

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,010
it but at the same time one of my other

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,270
cautions is go test other technologies

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,760
because when you have a hammer

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,350
everything's a nail and so just because

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,140
you know Drupal doesn't mean Drupal is

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,360
the best solution for it and so that's

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,100
one thing I would caution is again like

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,220
I said build for scale

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,720
you may find yourself you know ten

00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,130
months from now cursing the decision to

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,980
use Drupal even though you love Drupal

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:34,950
and your smile actually feel like I'm

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:34,950
hitting a heart sting here yeah right

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,910
correct correct

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:44,080
yeah and I'm a big fan of WordPress now

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,270
after the last couple years being in

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,380
there and I'll be honest there there are

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,530
times when I tell people I'm like don't

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,299
use Drupal like just don't and and it

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,799
takes a little you know you have to kind

00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:54,760
of swallow your you throw up when you

00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,870
say that at the first couple of times

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,570
and then you're like okay no there's

00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,220
something I can't say but ya know it

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,870
really is and I think that's part of

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,370
being on the island of Drupal is that we

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,679
just think everything can be Drupal eyes

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,690
it's not really that way like we should

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,760
actually encourage other technologies

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,900
and encourage other things so if you are

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,120
building on Drupal and you're building a

00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:18,010
product on Drupal make sure you don't

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,870
let drupal's how do I say it quirks get

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,520
out to the users at times you're gonna

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,070
have to do some some fine-tuning in

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,630
places but yeah definitely make sure you

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,039
take a look at and make sure you're

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,809
making the right technology decision not

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:34,630

00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:37,210
