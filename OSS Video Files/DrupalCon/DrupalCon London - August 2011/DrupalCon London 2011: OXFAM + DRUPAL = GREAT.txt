Oxfam is an international confederation of 15 organizations working together in 98 countries to find lasting solutions to poverty and injustice. Since they need to communicate quickly and richly with their staff, partners, and allies across the world, they turned to Drupal as a framework to help build and power many of their public and private websites. This presentation will focus on how Oxfam is adopting Drupal as an organization to meet its unique goals and will highlight, through case examples, how Drupal is used to power Oxfam's public website (oxfam.org) and their global intranet (sumus.oxfam.org).

The public website (oxfam.org) is one of the leading NGO websites and is an important communication portal used to communicate the work that Oxfam does to a global audience in three different languages. It provides visualizations of the projects Oxfam does across the world, provides important information about the various humanitarian campaigns, and provides the public access to the data rich reports produced by Oxfam on a regular basis.

The global intranet (sumus.oxfam.org) has over 6000 users from across the world. It was built as a joint effort between Oxfam International and Chapter Three leveraging some of the best cutting edge Drupal technologies and group collaboration workflows. Users of Sumus can drag and drop customize their own dashboards, individual working groups can define their own group spaces, documents can be stored and searched in a powerful document library, researchers can use Apache Solr to search across multiple Oxfam Drupal properties, and people everywhere can real time chat using an XMPP powered live chat system.

The session will be given by web developers Joe Baker (from Oxfam) and Matt Cheney (from Chapter Three)

by                                way of introduction some as i mentioned                                this is me before i got facial hair my                                name is Matt Cheney I actually I don't                                work at Oxfam unfortunately but I do                                work in San Francisco for a company                                called chapter                                                 nonprofit and NGO work for a lot of                                different organizations around the world                                and really sort of have made that a core                                part of our business and the way we sort                                of think about think about things ever                                since we started in                                                    my favorite organizations just                                personally so working with with with Joe                                and the rest of the team was really                                rewarding an excellent experience and it                                was something that like I think was                                really sort of really what I set out to                                do in Drupal when I started chapter                                  with with Josh's back here and Zach                                Rosen we actually sat around at a table                                and we talked about sort of why are we                                starting this company so it's like                                     what's a while ago and one of the things                                i had mentioned at that time was that I                                really loved Oxfam I really wanted to                                work on like a web development project                                with them to help them do their work                                better so sort of that's Rubicon Paris                                there was a RFP for a project came out                                and I sort of you know got involved                                there and it's been a really good time                                and a good experience working with with                                everyone at Oxfam land on their projects                                we did and it's sort of our privilege to                                share with you some of those experiences                                today so that's who I am I love through

years I first touched                                rupal on version                                                        I can't report year it was two thousand                                four

we're going to start off talking a                                 little bit about sort of how Drupal can                                 work for good and definitely throw the                                 source of personal motivation for Joe                                 and I around a lot of the work we do and                                 then we're going to get into some                                 specifics and sort of how the anatomy of                                 an NGO would break down really give you                                 a good overview of what Oxfam is what                                 kinds of work that they do and sort of                                 you know what kinds of problems are                                 trying to solve and how technology can                                 help and then we're going to spend the                                 bulk of our time going through really                                 three very good examples of how Oxfam is                                 use Drupal first in their public website                                 Oxfam dot org to help to to do all the                                 wonderful things it does there on the                                 blogs at Oxfam that word site to                                 coordinate a lot of different voices and                                 get a lot of different messaging out and                                 then on the oxfam international internet                                 which is a project I worked on that                                 helps too photo coordinate sort of the                                 work internally at Oxfam between the six                                 thousand or so folks who work across the                                 Confederacy and then we'll spend some                                 time at the end sort of talking about                                 some of the sort of developer tricks and                                 some of those sort of technical bits                                 that went into the                                 since its Rubicon will show a little                                 code and talk about modules but that's                                 something we'll probably sort of get in                                 more detail if people want sort of in                                 Q&A or after this session but in general                                 talk about Oxfam what it does how it                                 uses Drupal and how nonprofits or NGOs                                 that you might work with could sort of                                 use some of those lessons to do the same                                 so stick it off as I mentioned let's                                 talk about making the world a better                                 place make it how the place we want to                                 live and show how we can do it with code                                 this is a sort of interesting problem                                 for people I think who come into                                 technology because unlike a lot of the                                 work that ox em would do or other                                 nonprofits to do this very hands-on very                                 direct you can work with people you help                                 writing little ones and zeros and your                                 computer has a sort of you know                                 disconnected sort of sort of space from                                 the actual good that you do and it                                 requires a little bit of sort of you                                 know creative thinking and planning to                                 understand how can I use something like                                 a CMS a pile of scripts in PHP to                                 actually affect the kind of social                                 change that we want it's definitely a                                 little impersonal sometimes for right                                 code but I think as will demonstrate you                                 know the more code that you write and                                 the more specifically you know useful                                 that code is the stronger will help                                 organizations pace be and that's really                                 what drives a lot of the work that that                                 I do and I think this is sort of how                                 Drupal will will save the world so as                                 the blog post Jeff Robbins wrote in                                      it's still timely today it's a very                                 interesting because his sort of crux of                                 this thing is communication that the                                 number one reason why sort of something                                 like Drupal is helpful to organizations                                 is it allows them to communicate the                                 work that they do the messaging the                                 campaign's the fundraising appeals and                                 information out to the rest of the world                                 that this is true for a large                                 organization like Oxfam that has a lot                                 of different campaigns and and it is                                 involved a lot of different projects                                 well this is also true with sort of very                                 small examples a small group of people                                 trying to highlight an injustice maybe                                 organizing group trying to accrue more                                 members to sort of you know make a                                 change in their community or any number                                 of other things in between and that                                 that's sort of really telling because                                 when you can take some laid repeal that                                 right now does need a lot of sort of                                 code and glue code and real custom                                 config to get working if you sort of                                 take the vision that's just putting out                                 there and and things that Joe and I will                                 believe that if we can make                                 more useful and more end sort of user                                 focused and easier it sort of reduces                                 the barrier to entry for organizations                                 to communicate and I think that's really                                 where I come down with technology in                                 that we can build something as a drupal                                 CMS that lets people sort of talk about                                 their ideas and really push them out                                 there without the need to write a lot of                                 code and to have that kind of open                                 source free experience and I think                                 that's something that is sort of part of                                 the culture of Drupal to sort of make                                 these kinds of tools for people i think                                 it's honestly some of the reasons that                                 people got into drupal in the first                                 place and definitely it's sort of part                                 of the history of drupal drupal one of                                 the early industries that drupal did                                 really well in back in                                                   nonprofit space they have a lot of                                 unique needs and costs and you know                                 flexibility is sort of sort of some of                                 those and that drove a lot of people to                                 sort of see an adopt rupal my friends                                 Neil and Neil drum Zac Rosen started the                                 first Drupal company it was a non-profit                                 focused company that would make a                                 distribution of Drupal called civic                                 space that a lot of organizations use at                                 a point sort of                                                         some cases even more well-known than                                 Drupal was like people had asked for                                 civic space as a thing because they were                                 a non-profit they had heard it sells                                 nonprofit problems and then I think                                 there's sort of been stuff ever since                                 that really sort of captivate cops eyes                                 on that kind of interest in nonprofits                                 have been some of the biggest Drupal                                 sites or nonprofit sites there's a lot                                 of people who are professionally and                                 Drupal that only work on nonprofit sites                                 and I think it's part of part of the                                 part of the history and the future as                                 well as I think there's something that                                 Joe and I were talking sort of earlier                                 today about how Drupal really I think it                                 tracks in these people that the aspect                                 of an open source community like ours                                 it's really about sharing collaboration                                 and sort of helping other people and                                 that I think the people who are drawn to                                 Drupal as an open source project are                                 also drawn to working with organizations                                 that have similar missions and so                                 there's this sort of really virtuous                                 cycle where people are they're                                 interested in sharing collaborations                                 they get involved rupal they then decide                                 to share and collaborate with people in                                 the nonprofit space and sort of you know                                 if you know feel good and do good about                                 that and then they come back and Drupal                                 and contribute more code and it really                                 becomes a pretty good good in place                                 there's a website Drupal for good on                                 groups drupal org where a lot of people                                 will talk about their experiences and                                 share code and                                 you know help and have that kind of kind                                 of interaction and definitely check that                                 out if you're interested in sort of how                                 how a Drupal can work with nonprofits or                                 NGOs because at the end a Drupal +                                 nonprofits sequel great for a lot of                                 different reasons obviously the                                 community as I mentioned is really                                 helpful if your nonprofit you want to                                 hire someone in Drupal it's a lot                                 actually probably easier to do that than                                 it is you're a different kind of                                 business if you want to have an                                 extendable powerful site that you can                                 use to do whatever Drupal's really good                                 solution and the costs especially free                                 for the open source stuff is really is                                 really attractive to a lot of                                 organizations you can get going quickly                                 you can iterate quickly and you can take                                 advantage of the sort of experience and                                 genius of a lot of people that came                                 before you um and I think that's sort of                                 you know sort of part of why we sort of                                 see Drupal and nonprofits is working                                 really well together and definitely some                                 of the reasons that oxfam and                                 authorizations have chosen it so I'll                                 turn over to Joe now to sort of talk                                 about more specifically sort of what an                                 NGO how it works and specifically sort                                 of Oxfam and how they structure their                                 their organization as we sort of dive                                 into some of the details thanks man so                                 um I'm aware from the hands up early one                                 that actually a lot of you are from NGOs                                 will work with NGOs but we both thought                                 it'd be useful Ruiz talk particularly                                 about you know what an NGO is why it                                 exists sympathy my experience here at                                 Oxfam but aware that just by talking                                 about ox hunters me I'm talking about                                 all NGOs no NGO is like another every                                 every NGO has a different structure                                 different format different agenda even                                 if it's kind of basically doing the same                                 thing there's no hard and fast rules to                                 say this is an NGO Oxfam as analyzation                                 has existed since about the                                             together we work in                                                     the world and our agenda is to work for                                 a just world without poverty we are as                                 an organization outright outraged by the                                 persistence of poverty in the world and                                 the injustice which which follows it up                                 which keeps it in place and we believe                                 that this must and and can be overcome                                 if we work hard enough                                 the unjust policies and practices that                                 exist at local national and                                 international levels can can and must                                 all be challenged and people's rights                                 must be respected in this process so                                 we're committed as analyzation to                                 strengthening especially citizens                                 movements across the world to work                                 together towards economic and social                                 justice and one of the ways that Oxfam                                 does this and this is very common in                                 many NGOs is that we do this                                 particularly through partnership we try                                 and find indigenous native organizations                                 people who are already working on the                                 ground and work with and find out ways                                 rather than coming in as a sort of                                 Imperial wealthy Western organization                                 with all the great ideas we try and find                                 people who already understand the                                 situation and work with them and find                                 ways in which we can join together um                                 many people when they think of Axum they                                 think of one organization but actually                                 we're                                                                   people especially in Britain don't don't                                 see this and I don't know so well about                                 that how outcomes vide in other parts of                                 the world but certainly Britain we know                                 we have Oxfam bookshops and and so on                                 all around the country and everyone sees                                 Oxfam the organization but actually we                                 are separate                                                           here most of those member organizations                                 are national size so you see the                                       them there the only exception being                                 Canada where they have to authorize a                                 shins ox and Canada arts and Quebec                                 alongside each other we have a couple of                                 observer organizations organizations who                                 are observing octamer as an organization                                 as a whole and working out whether they                                 really want to be committed to be part                                 of the this larger Confederation the                                 result of this is that actually these                                    organizations are separate legally                                 financially separate from each other                                 they are able to determine their own                                 structures their own methods of working                                 or within of course the confines of                                 being members of the Confederation and                                 then there's this one little bit called                                 Axum international which is what I work                                 for that is supposed to try and join all                                 these                                                     then help them have one way of talking                                 one way of delivering our work at large                                 axum Amnesty International is a decision                                 that many people will know analyst                                 international is kind of inverted in                                 size from us anisty international is                                 huge by comparison with the net the                                 national bits of lakhs of amnesty                                 amnesty Great Britain amidst the America                                 and so on are small and so anisty                                 International is able to be much more                                 executive in making the authorization                                 run as a whole axum International is                                 tiny we're very very small and so we                                 can't be exactly we can't say this is                                 the way to do things we have to do                                 things through collaboration through                                 convincing and persuading and that's is                                 in effect the way that rocks and works                                 in the field we try and find people that                                 we can work with together in in                                 collaboration through convincing and                                 persuading and working together you can                                 see where we're going with the Drupal                                 world can't you similar kind of terms                                 because Oxfam is                                                       we we do kind of what trees was talking                                 about in the keynote today we have lots                                 of different technologies that every                                 organization uses something different                                 and certainly in just quickly trying to                                 look look around the different Oxfam                                 websites all of these are active in                                 different places also America uses plone                                 Oxfam France uses this one called spit                                 which I'd never heard of before aw I'm                                 great britain the biggest part of Vox                                 I'm actually do everything pretty much                                 by hand with Dreamweaver if you can                                 believe that and there's some custom PHP                                 out there and then there's a few Oxfam's                                 which are now starting to use Drupal                                 quite a bit more axum international was                                 the first pretty much awesome germany                                 are now using drupal quebec and canada                                 both using it and awesome in spain is                                 also moving that direction i think they                                 are using this smart site experian i                                 think yeah I think it's either them or                                 Australia using it                                 I think um but I knocked some                                 international we love Drupal we think                                 Drupal is great for many reasons really                                 that trees thoughts about earlier on it                                 allows us to sort of homogenized a very                                 disparate set of it of ways of                                 communicating and having delivered                                 through one system one method one                                 approach one one thing that we have to                                 update maintain and so on so forth it                                 simplifies the whole process it makes it                                 much much easier for us to to deliver it                                 and of course the values that underpin                                 the Drupal community are very very                                 similar to the values that underpin                                 awesome as an organization so it's a                                 really really good fit so we're going to                                 talk for the next few minutes about                                 three sort of key examples of how Oxfam                                 as a an organization as an NGO uses                                 Drupal I'm going to talk about the                                 international website to the public                                 website on time to org and about the                                 website and Matt will talk about the                                 Internet so the public websites really                                 is the front door to the organization                                 it's the way which we do what Jeff                                 Robbins was talking about it's the way                                 which we communicate what's really                                 happening out there in the in the                                 disaster zones in the places which are                                 in desperate need of development we use                                 the site to talk about the most pressing                                 issues which we are addressing as an                                 organization talk about how awesome is                                 responding to these pressing issues and                                 especially talk about how people can get                                 engaged with them themselves about what                                 you can do as individuals and as groups                                 outside International is not allowed to                                 raise its own money there's one of the                                 one of the important factors for us is                                 that we don't build a constituency we're                                 not allowed to take away from the                                 potential that for reaching the general                                 public that the national opt times can                                 use and so we're not allowed to raise                                 any money we're not allowed to build a                                 constituency and so the website also                                 exists as a form of signposting trying                                 to push                                 it uses of the website towards their                                 local or national Oxfam's and yes so the                                 websites does three really key things it                                 talks about our message it gets the                                 message out to particularly in terms of                                 emergencies and crises what's going on                                 it gives breaking news as the                                 emergencies occur once the emergencies                                 has developed and we just art to really                                 understand what issues are then we are                                 able to start building lots of                                 background information and finally we                                 start to atoms elements of real human                                 stories of what people are actually                                 experiencing and how they're struggling                                 to survive in these really difficult                                 situations for us doing this with                                 withdrew poise is really really easy got                                 some excellent tools that we we use all                                 the time views image cache no queue and                                 that sort of thing to make sure that the                                 most up-to-date the most vital                                 information it's always always being                                 bubbled up to the top to the top of the                                 the emergency section of the site to the                                 top of the home page and the most                                 important information is always being                                 pushed out we're also able to do quite a                                 lot of you know funkier things in this                                 air at the site with videos with lots of                                 custom JavaScript so I make galleries                                 and and so on to communicate the story                                 of what's going on in these these                                 various situations we're also going to                                 talk about our mission mean obviously we                                 don't want to have to keep responding to                                 crises we don't want all these terrible                                 things to happen and so we want we work                                 very very hard on development underneath                                 it all we engage in all kinds of                                 projects all around the world                                 particularly trying to partner with as i                                 said before local organizations on the                                 ground who understand the situation is                                 far better than we do in the developed                                 world this section site works in a very                                 simple way we're using lots of views and                                 image cache sort of stuff but we we try                                 and give it a very focused geographical                                 context                                 so you use the locations module and the                                 openlayers tools for mapping and then                                 the third major aspect is about creating                                 change in the way things happen and so                                 awesome as an organization participates                                 in lots of campaigns we have been doing                                 this for ages using the same sort of                                 tools views nokia image cache that sort                                 of stuff in the drupal world but we're                                 just in the process of moving many of                                 these campaigns over to sort of sites in                                 their own rights sub sites within the                                 larger site and the way we're doing this                                 is using spaces features and and context                                 modules and the grow campaign which is                                 this top one here I'll talk about this                                 in a few more details a bit later on but                                 the grow campaign is the first major                                 campaign we're dealing with in this this                                 way as a site within the main site and                                 so if you go to ox and all / grow if you                                 English your first language and then you                                 better see that section of the site has                                 its own visual identity and Justin here                                 on the front page front on the front row                                 worked on that project with us the final                                 area of the site is all about activism                                 getting involved and there's many ways                                 which people get involved we want to                                 engage people whichever way we can you'd                                 be surprised to know that actually that                                 the most highly viewed page of the site                                 on it again involved section is this one                                 here working with Oxfam almost double                                 the views of the whole site over of any                                 other page are on our chops page but                                 there's lots of other ways which people                                 get involved and so we we have ways to                                 even get informed with lots of videos so                                 you can see here we're synchronizing it                                 with with data on YouTube we run                                 petitions we're very active in many of                                 the social networking sites especially                                 active on Twitter for which we're very                                 proud really of be able to engage people                                 we talk a lot about events their                                 upcoming                                 and about ways much people volunteer and                                 so for this we're very proud ready of                                 the way in which Drupal allows                                 integration with external tools and we                                 use that as much as we can in the site                                 the second so I want to talk about we're                                 on on Drupal is the blog site so this is                                 really a very simple site it does one                                 job and it does it quite well really it                                 was originally a wordpress blog run on                                 wordpress com which is obviously not so                                 good on the branding side of things so                                 we moved it in house into a blog a                                 triple blog pretty soon after I arrived                                 three years ago doing really what dress                                 was talking about this morning as i said                                 before trying to bring up all of our                                 websites on two to one platform the blog                                 site does two jobs and for us one is                                 that it gives a voice to the voiceless                                 we one of the things we do very                                 frequently as we allow people who are                                 working within the field to to talk                                 about their experience their life what's                                 going on where they are and so many of                                 the blogs on there are stories of                                 people's own experiences but we also try                                 and make it a way in which the real                                 human beings inside the organization are                                 able to talk as well so we make a big                                 point of identifying each of the                                 bloggers are on the site as well and                                 this allows the you know the site to                                 give it to be a place of dialogue the                                 place of exchange conversation thoughts                                 and ideas backwards and forwards one of                                 things we want to do with all this is we                                 be able to interact much more closely                                 with the with social networking sites so                                 we've you may have seen it on the screen                                 shots we've created a short URL service                                 ox am a very fortunate that armenia has                                 a dot am domain top-level domain                                 extension so we have awesome as our URL                                 shortening service and the good old Jeff                                 Robbins created the short you                                 well tool for Drupal so we have a very                                 own short URL website to create our                                 short URLs which are then able to use                                 all over the place such as social web                                 links and then the final thing just to                                 say at this point is that in the public                                 web stuff we do everything in three                                 languages English French and Spanish                                 other languages that we publish in                                 English is our business language but and                                 so the internet is only in English but                                 the public web is all in three languages                                 excellent so sort of you know Joe sort                                 of reviewed the sort of two of the major                                 public websites that help to communicate                                 oxidization to the sort of the west of                                 the world I'm going to talk for a little                                 bit around a private website which is                                 called sumus but it's it's really the                                 sort of global internet for oxfam                                 there's something like                                                   are on it that sort of our across the                                 Confederacy and it's sort of designed to                                 have a sort of you know connecting type                                 of experience for everybody people who                                 work across the different geographies                                 often tackle the same problems and one                                 of the major goals of the site was to                                 figure out ways that they can share                                 documents and communicate and get up to                                 date with sort of best practices and                                 what people are doing I'm Drupal as it                                 turns out the pretty good tool for this                                 kind of stuff and there's a lot of                                 features and functions relatively                                 straightforward to build and Drupal but                                 has an enormously powerful impact on                                 sort of organizational effectiveness and                                 the ability to sort or work with other                                 people um site itself is a it's pretty                                 large this points got about a hundred                                 thousand pieces of content a lot of                                 documents a lot of a lot of news post                                 forum posts a number of other things and                                 that all sort of you know is a parcel                                 out depending on what category or kind                                 of thing it is but there's there's a lot                                 going on on the site it's a runs in the                                 cloud has a lot of them smart logic                                 behind it and it's a you know really                                 sort of sets out to say how can we                                 coordinate and amplify the the sort of                                 work that's already being done so when I                                 we sort of got involved in this project                                 on almost two years ago now we sort of                                 came in our I swear came in and sort of                                 worked with Joe and and other people                                 there to figure out sort of how                                 is the organization currently                                 structuring itself into small teams into                                 small groups and to understand sort of                                 what it would take to sort of add a                                 little drupal magic to it to make those                                 those kinds of processes better I think                                 for a lot of people in this room who                                 work with technology and nonprofits                                 you're acutely aware that nonprofits and                                 NGOs have very particular ways I already                                 do things it's very hard to names to                                 change those things you can sort of get                                 to a certain point and I think one of                                 the important sort of sort of initial                                 goals we had with the site was how do we                                 sort of tape was already being done and                                 if it always to make that better as                                 opposed to trying to just drop in a                                 solution say it's all this way now so we                                 identified a number of things for as                                 part of strategy process like a focus on                                 documents for example that became really                                 important in the work that we did or                                 desire to connect with other people                                 really important and I would sort of say                                 to sort of terms of sort of thinking                                 through a project like this one of the                                 things that we found really helpful was                                 the the idea of prototyping Drupal                                 because it is so module and extendable                                 it's relatively easy to sort of just                                 drop in a module that does something                                 relatively roughly and sort of see is                                 that going to work for your ganization                                 so we spent at least the first three                                 months of the project really just sort                                 of coming up with ideas and doing tests                                 we spend a lot of time with open atrium                                 which is a great tool I assume a number                                 of people this room are using it great                                 collaboration tool works really well for                                 us for a bunch of use cases um locks                                 time site we initially started with open                                 a trainer the prototype realized quite                                 quickly there's a lot more complexity                                 that that they needed then open atrium                                 provides literally had the opportunity                                 to try getting users on open atrium and                                 applying more modules on top of that                                 relay to sort of see how things work so                                 you'll see stuff we'll talk about a                                 little bit around sort of activity feeds                                 and you know sort of notifications these                                 are things you can install the Activity                                 module or the notifications module and                                 get a sort of out-of-the-box experience                                 that you can sort of start to see how                                 will that help my organization um but                                 you know we sort of spent about three                                 months working through that I had a lot                                 of                                                                    Francisco with with with Oxford that was                                 fun                                 but it was it was good to sort of get                                 that rolling and I would say as a Drupal                                 project Drupal makes it so easy to get                                 things up and running quickly you should                                 spend a lot of time figuring out how to                                 prototype and test things that                                 ultimately it's not about just building                                 it the right way it's about building it                                 the way that would work for people and                                 so that was that was certainly a goal as                                 well as figure out a design and and some                                 other sort of styles that still                                 reflected the Oxfam brand and identity                                 but would work well for actual end users                                 so there's a lot of different elements                                 you'll see little drop-down menus see                                 all buttons and style boxes that we use                                 sort of consistently across the site                                 that look good but also function well                                 and those went through the same sort of                                 iteration process terms of sort of                                 getting into the features of the site                                 the the sort of core of the internet                                 site is it's a group system uses organic                                 groups it has uh you know quite a few of                                 these things that would range anything                                 from a sort of like short term team that                                 would be put together to a handle a                                 particular crisis just sort of ongoing                                 stakeholder organizations that sort of                                 persist throughout sort of the                                 organization and that each of the                                 group's really is sort of a central                                 driving place for sort of communication                                 and work Drupal has a great group system                                 our organic groups in Drupal                                             Drupal                                                               think also reflects the sort of                                 team-based approach and collaboration                                 approach that works really well Oxfam so                                 when we started off the some of the                                 stuff that went on here that was                                 relatively easy to do in Drupal is we of                                 course because it's a group you can join                                 the group so there's a number list                                 available for for individual groups you                                 can see sort of who's a part of it and                                 what their title organization is this                                 sort of helps again some of the                                 connections stuff we'll talk about in a                                 minute but member lists were relatively                                 easy to do here there's a tab on all the                                 group's you can see who the members are                                 there's also a set of sort of                                 permissions around each group some                                 groups are private some are public                                 summary you know sort of send me in both                                 ways and that was also really helpful                                 because there's a lot of work sometimes                                 that is a confidential nature or private                                 nature and having a system that will                                 allow you to sort of have those                                 permissions is really important and                                 Drupal is really good at this because                                 you have a node access system in Drupal                                 that is sort of you know connecting the                                 entire sort of framework together so we                                 can                                 up so that a particular group you can                                 say this piece of content is available                                 to the entire public and this one is                                 private and not only will that show up                                 sort of appropriately in people's feeds                                 they will see public stuff not private                                 but it will also work if they share it                                 it will also work on search and it's                                 sort of all ties together and it's a                                 really good advantage of Drupal is that                                 sort of access control system because                                 everything sort of talks to it and if                                 you have used cases ourselves listings                                 you private some public note access and                                 drupal's up be a little tricky to get it                                 set up right but it's definitely                                 powerful when you do and then sort of                                 the bulk that are the rest of the stuff                                 on the group sites as really features                                 its it's what kinds of things do people                                 who want to have a group and have                                 members that group do and so to sort of                                 run through this kind of stuff the sort                                 of the biggest feature like the                                 existence use just by frequency is the                                 notification system where if you're a                                 member of a group the assumption isn't                                 you're going to come to this website                                 every day and check every one of your                                 groups but that you're going to be able                                 to manage your sort of queue of emails                                 in a way that room it makes sense to you                                 so you can have a digest version or a                                 daily version or a you know a real-time                                 version but that if you're a member of a                                 group and you've so decided to you can                                 say i get i want an email for every new                                 news post or an email for every new                                 document this kind of thing and this I                                 think is also a real good advantage of                                 Drupal I think people who really love                                 Drupal are like oh it's so great I work                                 on a site every day but when you start                                 talking about organizations where some                                 of the people aren't as tech savvy or                                 people who are in low bandwidth                                 environments maybe only have a mobile                                 device or can't access the Internet as                                 regularly having email notifications                                 send out is really is really slick and                                 the notifications module in Drupal is a                                 good framework that has a lot of                                 different functionality for what's                                 possible so every group has that as an                                 option and users can choose if they want                                 it or not there's also an activity                                 stream that uses the Activity module                                 which I mentioned that allows users who                                 do come to the site but maybe miss                                 something that happened to browse                                 history the activity stuff is really                                 smart it'll work for a per group basis                                 and a global basis and I can sort of                                 talk a bit about how it works for users                                 in a minute but that's a part of the                                 site and then when you start talking                                 about other sort of add-on features that                                 groups would need we have a really                                 strong                                 calendaring an event system so you can                                 post individual events you can get a                                 feed out of those events and there's now                                 several different view displays of like                                 what the events look like so you can see                                 week view month you this kind of thing                                 and that helps to sort of coordinate you                                 know people who have maybe have a                                 schedule that has several different                                 groups of events they can sort of see                                 see what kind of stuff I have there's                                 also a what's called core information on                                 this site but it sort of works a lot                                 like the page system in Drupal and has                                 to some extent us or wiki functionality                                 where you have this sort of set page and                                 you can create documentation or you can                                 create information and that had of stuff                                 if you want a really lightweight wiki                                 style type of thing you can sort of just                                 turn on standard Drupal page add some                                 revision control to it and maybe some                                 filtering on like some markdown or other                                 filtering to it and you can actually get                                 a really collaborative space only one                                 person can edit at at time and it's got                                 some limitations but it's easy to set up                                 and it can work really well if you just                                 want to say hey I'm going to keep ten                                 pages that reflect you know are these                                 specific ideas and people can update                                 them and see who updates them that's                                 that's just a feature on the site                                 there's also a discussion system that is                                 sort of looks like a forum that allows                                 for sort of a more interactive type of                                 back and forth there is a for module in                                 Drupal which does work for some cases                                 for this thing we actually just took a                                 sort of content type and just had                                 comments to it but they're threaded so                                 you can have actuals for rich                                 conversations and they're actually sort                                 of themed and put into a view on the                                 site so it actually does look sort of                                 more like a forum this many replies last                                 replies kind of thing there's also rich                                 multimedia integration the EMF field                                 module is used here in Drupal                                       could use the media module and that'll                                 support you know sort of videos from                                 third party sites audio from third party                                 sites there's also the audio module on                                 here if you want to upload your own b                                  and a number of other multimedia things                                 that allow you to have those have those                                 assets and input it into the system so                                 they can be shared or referenced or or                                 otherwise used on the side and then                                 there's a you know a few other sort of                                 things that are helpful there's a                                 Twitter sort of SS system called shouts                                 it's sort of a microblogging service hey                                 this is what I'm up to so I'm doing                                 check out this link and that's really                                 neat because it'll show up                                 group but it also will will be broadcast                                 out by email as well as as pop up in                                 people's activity streams there's a                                 there's a sort of full news news blog                                 type of situation to see latest updates                                 and then there's a sort of lightweight                                 task management system that allows you                                 to assign certain you know tickets to                                 people and use it so you think they like                                 manage new features on the website to                                 manage writing a report or these kind of                                 things and then there's a document                                 library system i'll talk about as well                                 that's also sort of cool and all of                                 these things you get to choose as a                                 group administer do you want them do you                                 not want them and so each group is sort                                 of customized differently so you'll see                                 here where as a discussion thing there's                                 a block right there for discussions if                                 you decided you didn't actually want to                                 have discussions you turn it off they                                 would just simply go away and that's                                 that helps each group is different and                                 this helps to customize it the document                                 library is a feature that um there's a                                 lot of ways to document management in                                 Drupal as well as other tools there's                                 tools like a fresco it's open source is                                 a great tool for document management                                 there's also ways to do it in Drupal                                 that I really really sort of slick in                                 this case what his documents were such                                 an important part of the site there was                                 tens of thousands of them would be                                 imported when we started we sort of                                 built it in a document system for each                                 group where you could actually upload                                 the document and assign it specific                                 taxonomy have comments against it share                                 it have it be permissioned and version                                 control than these kinds of things it's                                 not a sophisticated document management                                 system as something like alfresco would                                 be but it works within the existing                                 framework of Drupal so you automatically                                 get a notification when one's added you                                 automatically have your permission                                 system it shows up in the search and                                 this kind of thing and so that's the                                  kind of thing that ended up you know can                                  be really helpful for sort of                                  structuring a group that has a number of                                  assets they want to manage there's also                                  a really powerful Apache Solr search                                  integrating the site which is a total                                  Drupal standard for any sort of serious                                  search Apache Solr is really neat if you                                  do have a site that is a lot of content                                  on it it'll work for internal purposes                                  as well as external and respect access                                  rules which is very useful and you can                                  do everything from you know searching                                  the taxonomy and then filtering it to                                  searching with inside the document or                                  searching we even set up abilities to                                  could search other Drupal sites if you                                  want it or had this this site search by                                  other other                                  sites as well which offers a sort of                                  multi-site function just totally cool                                  it's also very fast and scalable so it                                  will you can use it without having the                                  sites for a slowdown but documents are I                                  can be a really important part and                                  drupal does an okay job of managing them                                  but a really good job of integrating                                  them into everything else that goes on                                  there's also a sort of the last really                                  big part of the site is the ability for                                  individual users to have their own                                  profile and presence on the site one of                                  the sort of original goals was to                                  understand that in a confederation of                                  Oxman we have                                                            do have people working on similar stuff                                  and you really want to facilitate the                                  collaboration of those things so there                                  is this ever user gets a profile that                                  fills out the information about them                                  what they work on what groups are in and                                  you know some other information on                                  contact stuff as well as you can see                                  there's an activity stream for that user                                  so you can see on what pilars up to you                                  know you know things she's done and get                                  that kind of information there's a this                                  is this is this is a profile that's                                  obviously linked to any where the user                                  comments or posts a document or shows an                                  activity feed and this really helps to                                  sort of expose people in the                                  organization to other people in the                                  organization that are are doing similar                                  work or origin relevant work that's the                                  kind of thing that you can sort of build                                  there's a friend system in place here as                                  well as a member directory system so you                                  can use a member directory to just sort                                  of browse people hey I'm working on a                                  technology issue in Great Britain you                                  know I could search and find someone                                  like Joe who I could then pop an email                                  or or sort of see what he's up to or                                  maybe I'm working you know you know in a                                  different area with a different                                  geography I can I can sort of filter and                                  sort people like that what I find people                                  that I like I can actually go ahead and                                  sort of Adventist refresh or to the to                                  the system and then there's actually a                                  sort of aggregated Activity fee where                                  you can sort of sort of follow or see                                  all the activity of people that will                                  like you so if you're a technologist in                                  the organization you can connect with                                  all the other technologists and then you                                  can get a real you get their micro blogs                                  you can get their document so you can                                  really sort of get a good or a bigger                                  sense of what the organization does and                                  I think it's really important when you                                  have a sort of geographically dispersed                                  organization but it would totally work                                  if you're just in an you know                                  have two offices or even a really big                                  office and want this and drupal does                                  this really well Activity module works                                  with user relationships module to you                                  know have this kind of integration and                                  all works really well with views and so                                  it was pretty easy to sort of set up                                  getting it you know useful obviously is                                  a little bit of a chore but but you can                                  check it out really easily there's also                                  the ability to customize your user                                  experience which we'll talk to a little                                  bit of detail in a minute around the                                  specifics of other user dashboard not                                  every user is the same so they can                                  customize their experience but the sort                                  of you know overall goal of the internet                                  site was to say let's understand that                                  we're working in teams and collaborating                                  let's build functionalities really                                  useful for those that those groups I                                  don't let everybody on the site have a                                  profile and allow them to interact and                                  work with other people so that's sort of                                  sort of what all went on with the                                  internet and when it gets a lot of use                                  you can see a lot of interaction and                                  that's really cool and it was not you                                  know not it was definitely a lot of work                                  to build but it's leveraging so much                                  existing Drupal technology that you can                                  replicate this kind of thing relatively                                  easily and that's the kind of thing I                                  think it made it really is why Drupal                                  works really well for folks because                                  these are all these use cases somebody                                  has solved five different ways you just                                  can put them together like legos and put                                  a put a theme on it and now you have a                                  really cool site so that's sort of the                                  high-level here in terms of sort of                                  what's what's gone on public private                                  websites and I think we're sort of spend                                  the remainder of the time before we take                                  some questions which we can sort of get                                  into discussions around that but really                                  sort of talking about a couple features                                  we wanted call it in specific as things                                  that I think would be very useful to                                  people in this room and then show you                                  sort of a quick Drupal recipe for how to                                  do it um we have some code in some                                  modules here that will be in the slides                                  you can download so if you're not                                  developer you could download it and send                                  it to a developer and start a                                  conversation around that but i think                                  it's sort of part of this is is sort of                                  technical like what do you do to make                                  this happen and the other piece is                                  actually more for inspirational or or                                  sort of what is possible just to give                                  people an idea so i've got a few of them                                  that Joe as a few of them then we take                                  some questions                                  it happy of course to follow up on any                                  technical details later if people want                                  the conference around these things so                                  the first the first really technical                                  thing I want to sort of highlight is as                                  I mentioned users have the ability to                                  customize their own experiences on the                                  site this is something that drupal.org                                  has if you're on that site um this is a                                  slightly more powerful version of that                                  but the sort of the sort of foundation                                  here is this site is all built using a                                  module and drupal called the panels                                  module I'm a big fan of it I think it's                                  actually really good for drupal site                                  development but I mean you can do it                                  either way the the specifics cool part                                  about panels is that everything in panel                                  is sort of treated like it's I call the                                  panel pain but it sort of an individual                                  widget so like this section right here                                  for events by region is a little widget                                  that gets developed and built sort of                                  independently it actually probably is                                  using views on the backend to build this                                  data set but uh but it's sort of a                                  little a little bit and then all the                                  site for the internet sites all laid out                                  in panels so every every element is a                                  panel of some sort and they have                                  different permission rules and behaviors                                  depending on where they are and and                                  who's looking at them but the the cool                                  part is that because it is in panels you                                  can actually do a lot of customization                                  on top of it so there's a button you'd                                  see here that says customize this page                                  and if you actually go ahead and click                                  that what ends up happening is you know                                  it sort of switches the view so it                                  actually has sort of a more of an                                  administration view this is only for                                  this user and only for their specific                                  functionality you can see won't blow                                  that up just to see a little bigger um                                  you can see how what used to look just                                  be the content now has the ability to                                  filter various settings for that piece                                  of content to actually delete it there's                                  a little a mover mover a mover bit that                                  you can move it around to different                                  areas and then an add add new pain item                                  so you can add additional additional                                  items here so if you hit add you                                  actually get a sort of add modal that                                  pops up and lets you have a widget                                  library of there's some global widgets                                  there's some just just for me widgets                                  there's some miscellaneous ones and some                                  networking ones and that this is                                  something that you know is sort of                                  relatively new rolled out in the site                                  but it allows for people to have that                                  kind of customization experience and you                                  can do this for as a developer you can                                  do this for a user home                                  page you could just for a group home                                  page you could do this for any number of                                  pages and you could do it either for our                                  group basis per user basis it's pretty                                  flexible the sort of the recipe here to                                  do it the you would obviously panels                                  module to do this but there is ways to                                  do this with the dashboard module as                                  well if you don't use panels um and                                  basically the way we had done it on this                                  site was we use a module called panels                                  ipe which stands for employees editor                                  that's what actually lets the dragging                                  and dropping happen on the front page                                  panels node and content profiles say                                  every user gets one of these panel notes                                  that they can configure and then you                                  know just you when the user gets created                                  this function gets called to give every                                  user a panel note and then when you                                  actually look at the homepage it calls                                  this function of these uh these two                                  lines down here to just show that page                                  to users less than edit it so it's a                                  it's pretty like it so I thought that's                                  pretty clever way to do this but it lets                                  you have a home page that's customizable                                  per user by using content profile and                                  you can then define all the widgets ago                                  and I think it's cool second thing                                  recommendations so as I mentioned                                  there's a lot of need to try to connect                                  people to other people that do similar                                  things or groups to do similar things                                  and if you go on like various like                                  social networks they'll Twitter will                                  recommend you you know people to follow                                  Facebook will recommend you friends and                                  these are pretty advanced algorithms and                                  they're what they are but a really like                                  lightweight way to do this is to build                                  little widgets like this you can put on                                  your site as an internal site so there's                                  a recommended groups and people but you                                  could just as easily do this for                                  document or activity or event or                                  whatever you want um so this is the sort                                  of front end of it the back end is                                  really simple Drupal it just says hey I                                  already have views and taxonomy module                                  on my site let's just go ahead and make                                  sure we have a structured set of like                                  interests or categories to apply to                                  different people so I forested in Drupal                                  and it's this uh this other person might                                  be interested in Drupal and then the                                  magic here is just to create a view of                                  users that shows me all the users that                                  have interests like mine and you know                                  that'll then theme it however you like                                  but that way you can sort of say hey                                  like this user has five interest show me                                  some users have similar interests and                                  you can actually then just display the                                  result it is a pretty quick way to sort                                  of go from                                  you know hey I don't know who else to                                  connect on the site to you know there's                                  some specific person you might want to                                  talk to and it'll actually show you                                  which keywords match so in this case you                                  know these these keywords actually match                                  this user that was really cool so this                                  is also a neat little recipe to set this                                  up that this would be of interest to you                                  so that's two from the internet the two                                  little tricks from the public websites                                  as I mentioned before because we are                                     organizations in different countries one                                  of the tasks for the public website is                                  to signpost people towards their local                                  Oxfam and so we use some clever little                                  tricks behind the scenes to work out                                  where in the world people are and then                                  threaten to delegate Sam to find out                                  more about well what that Axum is doing                                  or to donate towards that log Sam's work                                  if you're not in one of those countries                                  then you get a vanilla version of the                                  same sort of thing which allows you to                                  choose from this drop-down box here                                  we'll go to the general donate page                                  where you can find out more to do this                                  obviously we have a lot of users on our                                  public website and so we needed some                                  pretty heavy caching to make the website                                  run at all but we needed our the cash                                  tool to be aware of people's                                  geographical location the standard cash                                  tool just creates one cash for every                                  public use every anonymous user which is                                  no good for us so we what we did is we                                  took this is our recipe of what we did                                  we took one of the best cash modules                                  that are out there called cash module we                                  grabbed some free data which is                                  available from max mind calm which                                  converts IP addresses to a two-letter                                  country code and then we made some                                  additions to the cache module to prefix                                  everything that still in the cache with                                  the the country code it's very very very                                  simple really all it's doing for the                                  techie minded this is basically what's                                  happening if there's a country detected                                  then we just add on to the data is being                                  stored the country code                                  and cash module has some settings put in                                  the settings PHP file which were able to                                  capitalize on and say these are the only                                  countries that we're listed at we're                                  interested in in our list here so we                                  cash for                                                                  not in those                                                           generalized vanilla view if you're in                                  Canada you'll have a slightly different                                  experience because you is also Quebec in                                  Canada and the free data doesn't go down                                  fine-grained enough to region so in                                  Canada we present data for both awesome                                  Canada and awesome cubic second example                                  as I said we work in in three different                                  languages and so something about some                                  language where contents the grow                                  campaign is as I mentioned earlier ones                                  are big campaign that we're working on                                  at the moment all about food and food                                  security is one of the highest-profile                                  things we've ever done as a result of                                  that it has its own brand being                                  developed for it the logo is different                                  from the current all-time logos there's                                  a color palette which is unique for it                                  and some very unique materials being                                  generated per country upper / language                                  the three public languages that we work                                  in and so I very very briefly mentioned                                  earlier earlier that we use three key                                  modules from Drupal spaces context and                                  features to create these micro sites                                  which are all language aware so in                                  English the grow campaign looks like                                  this you have the the header of the site                                  to tell you are still within the Ox own                                  blog site but everything in this section                                  is a different color palette different                                  fonts from everything else in the rest                                  of the sites that's English this is                                  French this is Spanish and so the recipe                                  for that is is this space is basically                                  allows certain things to be set apart as                                  distinguishing this and this area the                                  site has distinct from everything else                                  allows you to override some of the                                  essential variables in in Drupal like                                  the panic of the homepage or a whole                                  myriad of other variables it does that                                  in lots of different options are                                  group can be a space or user can be a                                  space the way we do it is with the                                  taxonomy module a taxonomy term is the                                  term for a space so if something can be                                  classified by the taxonomy term which in                                  Drupal                                                                says this space is active when the space                                  is active the great thing about this is                                  using features module we can turn                                  features on and off in very similar way                                  to the way map is talking about with the                                  groups in the internet you can choose                                  whether to have active certain features                                  and we can build whichever features we                                  want so we have a feature which creates                                  press releases a feature which allows                                  media contacts a feature which allows                                  key facts and several others i can't                                  remember at the top of my head and then                                  each space can choose to have these                                  turned on and off for the three campaign                                  space is that basically identical so                                  they have the same features turned on                                  and off but as we go forward and have                                  more feet more campaigns using the same                                  set of tools we can say this campaign                                  needs to have more documents and so we                                  have that feature turned on and but it's                                  not interested in in media contacts we                                  have that feature turned off we could                                  even go down as fine grain as having a                                  particular logo / space which is which                                  is really really cool and because we can                                  detect whether a space is active with                                  spaces module very very easily then we                                  can do all kinds of things like adding                                  CSS JavaScript doing lots and lots of                                  team overrides whatever we want to to                                  make that section of the site look                                  completely different from any other                                  section so quick little recipe I think                                  that kind of brings us towards the end                                  so I guess it's time for questions                                  yeah yeah that's me I think it's a                                  common question for lot of NGOs and I've                                  talked to how do you delegate                                  responsibility for publishing materials                                  and it's something we've really                                  struggled with and historically the way                                  we've done it is we've had an English                                  editor a French editor and a Spanish                                  editor and they're the only people who                                  are allowed to put stuff on to the site                                  which has worked great but it's mean you                                  know it's exhausting for them everything                                  has to go through them as times gone on                                  we've slowly delegated more and more                                  material away from those three key                                  people and essentially done that by                                  training people to a certain standard                                  I'm hoping we are currently and I'm                                  hoping to push more towards delegating                                  more which I think will do what you're                                  you're talking about so already we have                                  several different user roles each user                                  role has a different level of access                                  they can different amount of things they                                  can use known edit page so historically                                  it's been very very centralized through                                  those three editors we are slowly moving                                  to dedicate more and it's tricky                                  well drupal has a really good user role                                  definition system pretty much you can                                  create as many permissions that can be                                  granted her role and then as a user                                  signs in to the site then Drupal                                  understands what role they have and we                                  basically use that all the way through                                  to work out whether this user is allowed                                  to create these kind of content their                                  pieces of content whether they're                                  allowed to create all the content or                                  just put it into a edit editing workflow                                  yes yeah we do it all we do translate as                                  much as we possibly can obviously it's                                  really important those well the all                                  these the sort of the framework elements                                  of Drupal including the menu system all                                  is translated through locale module                                  built into the Drupal core which does                                  work very very well we found                                  well we the lakar module allows you to                                  define which languages are active within                                  the system so we don't allow any content                                  to be put in that's not in those three                                  languages we don't publish in German we                                  only publish in French Spanish in                                  English so something arrives in Arabic                                  we put the PDF on in Arabic but with                                  English text in the CMS yes yeah yeah it                                  always hasn't won in English French and                                  Spanish follow on whenever they get                                  translated which is usually pretty close                                  afterwards there's not much I can think                                  of that's in safe Spanish and not in                                  English although I actually know in                                  South America South America and Latin                                  America there's a material focus on                                  those areas that is just in Spanish                                  you're not not in English                                  we just omit them yeah every language                                  every page has a language defined and                                  anything so if you're out if you're                                  viewing in Spanish you only see material                                  is in Spanish so I can nice and loud                                  um why you bring up the input so the                                  question is bespoke document management                                  system in Drupal the importing was from                                  the plone system there's tens of                                  thousands of documents that was that was                                  a little tricky and it knows mob parks                                  things had changed a little bit sort of                                  over the years he had a few different                                  versions um the second burger                                  question-answer the importing that we                                  used a bunch of dress scripts that                                  actually would go to create individual                                  drupal document nodes on the fly all                                  right as part of the import script so it                                  would basically take the take the dump                                  Trump loan it would parse it sort of do                                  category matching do odd you know sort                                  of date formatting and then just say                                  okay let's go create a bunch of those of                                  those nodes on terms of the actual                                  system I'm happy definitely getting some                                  of the details on it the high level of                                  it is there's a there's a node type                                  called document and a node type called                                  document folder and you can create                                  folders and reference documents for them                                  and then it's just a view of the                                  documents that are in there and you use                                  a there's versioning that's their                                  taxonomy that's their note access since                                  there and then you can sort of a female                                  search or sort and it just treated like                                  normal content it's not as powerful as                                  like an alfresco or some higher-level                                  document management but it does work                                  with all the other stuff so that's a                                  sort of good thing so yeah like file                                  field prost views equal document                                  management so that's about the amount of
