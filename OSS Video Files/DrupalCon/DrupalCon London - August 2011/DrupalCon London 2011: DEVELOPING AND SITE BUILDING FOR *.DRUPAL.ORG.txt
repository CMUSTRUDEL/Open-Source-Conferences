	                              alright I'm Neil drama I'm the I guess                               technologist for the drupal association                               and one of my job's is to help our                               improve the infrastructure for community                               contributions to drupal.org so in                               general like the best place to go for                               this is drupal.org / make drupal org                               awesome and since the big redesign a few                               months ago you know we've been                                continuing to improve our tools for                                developers to come and can contribute to                                developing insight building on                                drupal.org and yeah we just will get the                                message out that you know you can go and                                work on drupal.org and work get more                                stuff done so um the main thing we have                                technically is development environments                                and that these are full copies of                                actually these are partial copies of                                Drupal that work we do a couple things                                we even remove any personal information                                so there's no you can't get people to                                email addresses or anything else out of                                here and also a Drupal that looks kind                                of big so we get rid of things like                                forum posts older than I think                                        just so it's a little bit easier for us                                to move stuff around and yeah there's                                all the instructions there you can read                                through them whenever in what happens on                                our end is                                yeah so this is Jenkins this is what we                                use to manage lots of shell scripts                                basically and run them so we have these                                development environments this loading                                knows that                                so we actually have different sites that                                so any of the sites work for this these                                five are the ones that we have working                                so far the others need a little bit of                                work to get started but they all work so                                tests so this will build out track                                Norris approves of it it takes about I                                did one of these earlier so that takes                                about twenty eight minutes and since I                                did one earlier we have that so this is                                running right here and it's you know                                drupal and that sort of reduced and                                sanitize database with everything you                                need to work on it and there's a su lot                                of this stuff that happens on drupal.org                                is in this drupal.org customizations                                module just like any other highly                                customized site you know we have a bunch                                of packs piled into this module just to                                work with everything that we have going                                and there's also a custom theme uh so                                here's an issue for that tweak the                                footer there's right now good example is                                like drupalcon chicago and london we                                chicago's like kind of in the past and                                we don't want to advertise um denver so                                uh Lisa Rex haven't been helping out                                made a patch for this and so with these                                sites you get ssh access you can just go                                over to a staging vm that drupal network                                and you have a directory full of the                                usual                                website stuff it runs be our birth                                control system is bzr for this it's not                                good because this isn't a module on                                drupal.org it's the whole website so it                                doesn't need to be the same it's easier                                out long before we migrated again yep uh                                so and we might we're thinking moving it                                to get but you know it's mental work and                                Sam will probably talk about that uh so                                sites all modules Drupal work and still                                you get that patch that's not the patch                                it                                Oh                                okay so that's applied pcr knows about                                it and let's just make sure it works                                because that's always good okay and this                                is on a virtual machine in at our                                hosting company right the LSL oregon                                state lab so it's a little bit                                underpowered we have a bunch of these                                developments i piled on here about                                  year or                                                                you got the first changed a little bit                                drupalcon mix to a list of all the                                drupal comms so we don't have to go                                through this ever again for updating the                                drupalcon and there's a couple that are                                other good changes in here so that looks                                good drupal org is just a regular module                                so here's my check out of it let's make                                sure there's nothing going on okay get                                 that same patch                                 alright i'm on a mac so curl yeah and                                 the same thing there and yeah that looks                                 good its regular get tips a little bit                                 nicer than the vcr def                                 the reason we have all this put our                                 stuff in code rather than in                                 configuration which you might do on any                                 other site is because we actually have                                 about five or six sites they'll all have                                 the same footer so we push it out                                 through code that's a lot easier to                                 manage then configuration so commit that                                  or get push it                                 and then we go then myself or in it or                                 Sam or any other people helping maintain                                 drupal.org go back into Jenkins and work                                 on this or actually deploy this so we                                 can update that we use vendor branches                                 just keep track of yeah week                                 occasionally do hacks two modules we                                 really try to avoid it but you know it                                 happens so and three point X dash dev is                                 what we might just committed to                                 and yeah we've basically automated all                                 the VCR stuff so we don't have to deal                                 with it this is our kind of tool chain                                 for getting any module on to Drupal that                                 any of the Drupal network sites                                 and while that's running I could say                                 looks good good so that committed it's                                 actually fixed and we as a tag um needs                                 Drupal work deployment for anything                                 that's kind of already fixed in the                                 module and I'm ready to deploy so this                                 should finished and see this is my local                                 copy of local check out of drupal.org I                                 actually haven't done any local                                 development on drupal.org lately off the                                 stuff on the server kind of just works                                 and I have to deal with picking out how                                 I just got Mac recently I have to deal                                 with picking out what they do                                 differently about everything so pcr up                                 so that's you know all the info changes                                 info file changes since we have time                                 stamps in those and I don't see anything                                 else that I might be deploying that I                                 don't know about so I'm kind of                                 comfortable this change so let's go                                 ahead and change deploy it yeah we've                                 used bzr or we've used Jenkins very                                 heavily lately okay build that we don't                                 need to update DB or anything and                                 hopefully this doesn't bring the site                                 down that would be bad yep so all this                                 is doing is really running BTR up and                                 like Jenkins Jenkins great tool we don't                                 have to remember any of this week is                                 press the green buttons and that should                                 be just about done let's see what it did                                 if I there we go okay so I still up                                 footer changed so the point is we're                                 getting really good at the kind of                                 Drupal deploying Drupal changes and any                                 kind of really anything straightforward                                 is of course doable we had a couple good                                 changes that went out last month ago at                                 this point maybe you cut maybe three or                                 four weeks the API changed nodes that's                                 let's see Drupal core hopefully they're                                 using them I actually haven't looked at                                 it too much and of course the issue                                 summaries so I add down here view                                 changed records and really most the time                                 spent on this gen who introduced us I                                 did a lot of the development on this and                                 I think most of the correct me if I'm                                 wrong but most the time was spent going                                 back and forth about how this would                                 actually wear                                 and there wasn't you know yeah so yes                                 regular drupal stuff views content type                                 and most of the time I spent going back                                 and forth with few people figuring out                                 what to the fields be how should this be                                 at work so you know the more                                 straightforward the change is less                                 discussion it needs like faster it'll                                 get done so we're getting decent at this                                 sort of thing and yeah if you have stuff                                 that needs to be changed and you have                                 kind of a plan head over to head over so                                 this URL and kind of get starting to                                 like figure the others I kind of went                                 through this pretty quickly but you know                                 that helped us out and but that doesn't                                 solve like the high level stuff so we                                 have a couple other things he's going to                                 talk briefly about Prairie and you know                                 kind of some more high-level planning                                 and Sam is going to talk about improving                                 this infrastructure because right now                                 this is good for Drupal changes but if                                 you want to say do something different                                 on it get commit there's no these aren't                                 really hooked up to get in any way I do                                 I'm yeah yeah um we just which one do                                 you like deal with has to be turned on                                 better excellent okay I I don't have any                                 slides for this but if you want to see                                 slides you can come and see about an                                 hour of them immediately after this over                                 there I understand there's a lot of                                 interesting stuff going on here the                                 software as well I my name is Lisa                                 rykiel I am a user experience person I                                 wrote with my button on the some of the                                 I think end up being called blue cheese                                 dinner um theme for triple dog and on                                 some of the d                                                           lot of unfinished business with Drupal                                 dog and that our design time frames were                                 really small the kinds of things that we                                 got to look at were just tiny compared                                 to what we really wanted to be able to                                 work out and all just about everything                                 that we did was kind of outward facing                                 in terms of trying to explain Drupal to                                 people who might potentially want to use                                 it areas that we didn't really get to                                 touch on it all were how do we get                                 people into the community who are coming                                 here thinking about how they might want                                 to contribute and participate and also                                 how can we make it a better place to                                 support the community actually working                                 on Drupal make it a better place to be a                                 contributor I think drupal.org has got a                                 really huge role to play in both of                                 those goals making it an easier way                                 making it easier to get involved and to                                 become an active contributor and also                                 just generally for it to be a better                                 place to contribute I speak from the                                 perspective of somebody who contributes                                 not very often with code not ever I                                 think to dribble with code the kinds of                                 people that dress was talking about and                                 use keynote the you know marketing                                 people and the product managing people                                 and the kinds of people that I think you                                 know like it or not you're going to need                                 more of us in the future it's it's tough                                 for us to find a place on dribbble organ                                 connect with other people and kind of                                 start doing the sorts of work that we                                 need to do I know that that's not unique                                 to non-coding people I know it's a                                 really shared thing so anyway I started                                 talking and Chicago about something that                                 I call the Prairie initiative and it's                                 not an official capital I initiative                                 it's a small I initiative and it is                                 basically it's not a project it's like a                                 family of projects a family projects                                 that share                                 these two common goals of trying to make                                 drupal.org a more inviting place a                                 better kind of onboarding experience for                                 new contributors but also just a better                                 place a more effective place to be a                                 contributor as well so we've been                                 working over the past months since                                 Chicago on trying to identify what sort                                 of projects that involves and we've been                                 doing some work on a few things I think                                 are interesting and crossover with stuff                                 that the community has been talking                                 about for quite a while one of the areas                                 that's most developed at the moment is                                 one called we're calling it topic pages                                 so it's basically pages that you can go                                 to that aggregate all the activity kind                                 of across the the suite of stuff going                                 on in Drupal to do with a particular                                 area that you're interested in so for                                 example I would be joining and following                                 the user experience one um you guys                                 might join them for kind of different                                 ones too that we've got through a draft                                 list of about a dozen of those at the                                 moment that they be a dozen that we'd be                                 kind of trying to point people directly                                 to as good entry points but then beyond                                 that you know there's no reason why any                                 tag couldn't potentially become a topic                                 page so it's basically an aggregation                                 page of all the activity on a particular                                 topic that you're interested in that you                                 can then follow and go back and kind of                                 keep up to date with what's going on so                                 tie it into that is this idea of                                 notifications so I think one a problem                                 that a lot of us feel is that you have                                 to just be like completely connected to                                 dribble all the time in order to be able                                 to keep track of what's going on and                                 that's that's a problem for people who                                 can't be committing that kind of a time                                 basically anyone who's got a life most                                 of us you know so we need to we need to                                 be able to find ways to make it easier                                 for people who can't be constantly                                 connected to be able to keep up to date                                 with what's going on to do that in maybe                                 a more efficient way I think there's                                 lots of ways that we can do that this                                 kind of for me this encapsulates the                                 whole subscribe to issues thing and just                                 making that a lot less done than it is                                 at the moment but as other things as                                 well as being able to get like kind of                                 digests of what's been happening in a                                 day of stuff that's relevant and                                 interesting to you across all of the                                 different parts of dribble or from                                 groups to issues to me know                                 you and I are see on particular topics                                 of keywords that you're interested in so                                 we work on exploring that at the moment                                 looking at things like profile pages as                                 well you know if you're if you're new to                                 the community there's two things going                                 on first of all people are looking at                                 you wondering who you are and where                                 you've come from and what you know and                                 what you can contribute and I don't                                 think the dribble profiles give us a                                 clue about anyone until they actually                                 start committing stuff and you know if                                 like me you don't commit a lot of stuff                                 you don't know anything about me and                                 then by the same token I don't know much                                 about you I though if I'm a new person                                 coming into the community how our                                 profiles don't do a hell of a lot of                                 explaining who we are and who's who and                                 where what perspective were coming from                                 when we're talking about things that                                 we're talking about that's what they're                                 really important in terms of helping                                 make Drupal a more kind of collaborative                                 civilized place to be working so that's                                 another one of the areas that we're                                 working on we're looking just let the                                 whole kind of onboarding experience so                                 if you go to dribble the org with the                                 kind of inspiration that you want to                                 come in and help it's tough to find                                 where you go and how you actually do get                                 involved and there you know there's a                                 page if you find it called the getting                                 involved page and it is a wall of text                                 you actually have to fight really hard                                 to find a human being anywhere on this                                 diet that's kind of nuts I think given                                 that you know if you find the right                                 place there are thousands of people                                 doing all kinds of incredible things so                                 we want to find a way to connect people                                 to their potential peers much more                                 quickly um and also and interestingly                                 this is the kind of this is the thing                                 that really set me off on Prairie to                                 begin with the issue queue as we just                                 want to kind of look at ways that we can                                 make it a little bit more efficient than                                 it is at the moment but also look at                                 other types of spaces for different                                 types of of collaboration the issue                                 queue is really grateful here's a                                 problem I think I know how to fix it                                 let's do it it's not so great for I've                                 got this user journey of I'm a new                                 person coming to the site and here's my                                 problem chem how do we explore the best                                 way to to support that journey really                                 well something that's a little bit kind                                 of bigger and which is going to alter                                 roll out into a whole lot of different                                 pieces of work that need to be done but                                 neat is kind of stay connected as well                                 we don't we don't really have that                                 groups kind of ioc can be great for that                                 if you're there and if someone kind of                                 records it later but i think we can do a                                 lot better in that respect as well so                                 there are better areas that we're                                 looking at working on right at the                                 moment and having a better                                 infrastructure for more people to be                                 able to chip in and work on it more                                 easily is going to be really helpful                                 with that but you know as ever it's also                                 kind of a matter of time so yeah that's                                 that's Perry if you're interested in I                                 feel free to come pay me or come over to                                 the session that we're doing next uh so                                 and we have say who's been thinking                                 about getting these moving this from                                 running bzr piled into a pile all onto a                                 big virtual machine to something a                                 little bit better oh yeah plenty all                                 right this will keep me from like waving                                 my arms too wildly so as with most                                 things that i do i'm terrible at giving                                 a big overview but i can tell you a                                 story so the get migration i'm from like                                 january mid-january to when we actually                                 launched at the end of februari I I did                                 not do anything but they get migration I                                 mean that like I woke up it was get                                 migration all day I was on the phone for                                 hours a day at least with with the                                 project manager for it Melissa Anderson                                 who's not here unfortunately and and                                 then you know I would go to sleep and                                 I'd repeated elegant I had about two                                 days off in there the real reason that                                 that was so important didn't actually                                 have to do with the amount of work that                                 was needed to do it had to do with the                                 fact that I was the only one in a                                 position to actually declare the sanity                                 of everything that we were doing I went                                 to dinner once like in that like I left                                 for two and a half hours and I literally                                 came back to like the sky is falling                                 everything's broken we have to a month                                 out at this point people like we have to                                 push it off by a month they come to this                                 conclusion in two hours my point here                                 being that the real reason                                 we had that issues because it was                                 completely impossible for us to actually                                 get functioning remotely representative                                 development environments for individual                                 people who were helping with the                                 migration everybody was run through the                                 the get dev that we were running if                                 people remember that you would rebuild                                 that and you know people would poke at                                 it in whatever else but like it was this                                 big shared environment and it was                                 impossible to build anything local and                                 so you know for situations is nearly ran                                 through the system that we have for for                                 setting up stuff that's basically just                                 code base plus database and if that's                                 all that you need then that system works                                 very well but it's not all that we need                                 I mean in order to actually test                                 anything related to get you need the                                 full complement of get repositories                                 those need to be on disks there's a                                 bunch of internal servers and services                                 that you have to be able to provide that                                 stuff is not stuff that can be                                 encapsulated by a simple dump process so                                 I looked at this I said we need we need                                 better key way when you better QA in                                 general under bullet org you know right                                 now we're sort of dependent on                                 individual in for team members having                                 enough time experience and and mental                                 latitude to look at any given change                                 it's coming in and saying yes that will                                 work fine we don't have any kind of                                 automated testing that ensures that                                 we're not having regressions on                                 drupal.org when we when we put things                                 out you know deploy something and                                 exactly like noticed it is like that                                 looks fine that's our process so I                                 looked at this sort of need for ready QA                                 the need for individuals to be able to                                 set up real environments on their local                                 systems and I know that and I said okay                                 we could we could we could do something                                 better here also clearly the real reason                                 that I want people to set up local                                 development environments is because I'm                                 lazy and I want other people to do the                                 work let's just let's just put that out                                 there because that's obviously what I                                 want to have happen actually is true I i                                 need help i need more people to work on                                 get stuff and i can't it I can't ask                                 anyone to do it right now really like                                 they're like one or two people who know                                 some of the specifics of some of the                                 pieces and they have some access to                                 infrastructure so we can tweak at it but                                 apart from that now so i have this                                 proposal that's been cooking since the                                 middle of the summer                                 to create a system where and I should                                 I'll spare some of the details at least                                 but basically create a system where you                                 install set up VirtualBox locally set up                                 a ruby library called vagrant which                                 built on top of virtual box and download                                 about I don't know                                                    but at the end of it you have a cluster                                 of VMs on your local system that                                 represent a real lead out of production                                 environment and actually accurately                                 represent a real data production                                 environment as much as humanly possible                                 so you're using sanitized data you know                                 to the extent that we have to and you                                 but you have a real set up git                                 repositories you have the cute little                                 ssh daemon that we run to actually                                 manage all of your good pushes you have                                 your own version of that it's all set up                                 it's all configured all the                                 configuration is managed by puppet so we                                 would we take everything we do on to                                 glory we'd moving into puppet and we                                 would use those to provision your local                                 VMs and then the puppet repositories                                 that we use to actually drive that are                                 also available as part of the vm cluster                                 so you can work on anything from the                                 lowest levels of infrastructure up to                                 simplest things entirely on your local                                 system on a plane with this whole thing                                 kind of a holy grail shirt the other the                                 other benefit here though is that I mean                                 if we do that then we actually create                                 some some clear contribute back                                 mechanisms if we've expressed our entire                                 infrastructure and puppet then it means                                 you can look at the puppet configuration                                 to figure out what maybe needs to be                                 changed instead of having to ping nine                                 different people and infrastructure in                                 having no idea where the problem might                                 be it gives us a public place that we                                 express it if this plan would also                                 probably mean yes moving on moving our                                 web trees from from bizarre and to get                                 and if you want to contribute something                                 back on drupal.org you have a full                                 representative dribble at org site tree                                 similar to what you are actually the                                 same as what you have now on staging vm                                 but i mean we would probably do that and                                 get it's a larger project clearly to                                 actually do this the other piece of it                                 would be all the two other pieces that                                 would really be required or we need to                                 if we're going to use puppet then it                                 means that we need to use puppet                                 consistently across the entire                                 infrastructure so we use puppet to                                 provision these local VMs we also use                                 puppet to provision any to provision our                                 real production environment that's                                 really where the real value is is if                                 we're using the same configuration                                 management system so who knows a puppet                                 is I apologize all right puppet is a                                 configuration management system it's a                                 system for provisioning boxes you put                                 the right packages in the right places                                 and boxes become able to do stuff                                 automatically you you know run one quick                                 puppet script and then it goes from a                                 bare metal box into a fully functioning                                 deed at a web head or utility server or                                 something like that it's the basic idea                                 so if we if we use the same puppet                                 scripts to manage the local VMs to                                 manage our production environment also                                 potentially amazing too to create real                                 staging environments within our                                 infrastructure that we can use to create                                 a CI sweet so when patches actually come                                 in we could like run selenium against it                                 and make sure that we haven't broken                                 some crucial part of the site all of                                 this is is part of the proposal as I see                                 it's a few discrete different few                                 discrete different tasks that in my                                 assessment we want to fold into a single                                 proposal bring to the DA try to get some                                 funding for and have you know a team of                                 people actually work on this put it                                 together and make it happen if you want                                 to do them all at once because if we if                                 we don't do them all once then other                                 things will sort of Peter along for                                 years like like they do but if the goal                                 is to be able to give people a basically                                 a set of commands install vagrant                                 install virtualbox copy paste this set                                 of commands for hours later you're gonna                                 have a fully functioning local                                 environment fully functioning local                                 environment then it really makes sense                                 that we also invest the effort in                                 creating a CI infrastructure so that we                                 can better run people's patches through                                 you know a testing infrastructure and                                 have some idea as to whether we should                                 reject them or not and we also really                                 need to convert our infrastructure to                                 use puppets so that what they're using                                 locally best reflects what we what we                                 have in production but this is the goal                                 I am interested in like I said and                                 making an actual proposal to the DA for                                 this and saying let's make a budget for                                 it let's find some people want to work                                 on it                                 if you have any interest in doing this                                 please please please please please                                 please talk to me I'm trying to put                                 together you know a group of folks who                                 have experience in the relevant areas to                                 work on the different bits we can spec                                 out our own pieces will put together a                                 team will make this proposal and we'll                                 make it happen so yeah the drupal                                 association is thinking of doing kind of                                 grant program for drupal org and need                                 figure out you know the structure to                                 hand out that money and would like put                                 figure out what the priorities are and                                 we're just kind of in the early planning                                 stages of that said we need to we need                                 to figure out a basically a policy and                                 like water priorities are basic stuff                                 like that and that might kick off                                 realistically probably some time next                                 year so yeah if you have any ideas                                 around that I'd like to hear about it                                 one other big thing that we should do at                                 some point is upgrade to Drupal                                       the upgrade to Drupal                                            happened kind of at the start of the but                                 when the so when the drupal.org redesign                                 kind of kicked off for implementation we                                 were still running Drupal                                               least a few months if not a year after a                                 Drupal                                                                   few we did a sprint to upgrade to Drupal                                                                                                      pretty well it oh yeah we had about                                                                                                            yeah we should do the same thing at some                                 point hopefully later later this year                                 but that's also not scheduled yet but we                                 should do it in person sprint and you                                 know do the major upgrades and then                                 y'all spend about a month testing things                                 make sure everything works because it is                                 a big sites a lot of moving parts                                 um and yeah project ma any sort of                                 custom code there's actually have to do                                 this follow our custom code and Drupal                                 or project modules version control oh                                 yeah at minimum yes all of our custom                                 code in drupal org project module                                 version control and that sweet although                                 I mean you know that that's my                                 responsibility that's a relatively                                 painless upgrade path I back Porter the                                 energy system basically so we just go                                 right forward on it what else some                                 smaller things stage she does have a                                 newer version but multiple email does                                 not a assorted functionality yeah                                 so the best thing to do right now would                                 be to work on all of these modules and                                 ideally I mean so there's modules that                                 work as independent modules I think most                                 of them of course the big stuff like CC                                 k & B owes those are already working and                                 anything you can test independently                                 let's see like I paranoia about halfway                                 down the list that's a good example of a                                 random module that you can test on any                                 site and you know should work as good at                                 the mod it's a module for any sites at                                 least work for everyone so that's good                                 to work on other stuff would be kind of                                 like paying down technical that sort of                                 stuff and you know clean up drupal org                                 module has a bunch of stuff kind of                                 piled up into it and you know actually                                 the subscriptions for projects issues                                 that would help out a bit because I                                 would take a chunk of code out of                                 project module and put it into a more                                 standard subscription thing that                                 hopefully is a module that works in both                                 six and seven pretty well and yeah I                                 think right now the best thing to focus                                 on is kind of getting stuff organized so                                 the upgrade itself is is painless as                                 possible and yeah after that we'll                                 probably do a little bit special                                 infrastructure for well we'll probably                                 do a step back to do so integration site                                 that's running Drupal                                                   copy of drupal.org every day and runs                                 the upgrade overnight every day and we                                 can see how it's actually working                                 yeah in the course of the get migration                                 the more that I looked at project the                                 more that I came under the impression                                 that we've all been you know this is                                 never going to happen when I'm going to                                 say it anyway I i think the project                                 model could actually beautiful in drupal                                                                                                          like that i think you'd be amazing we                                 have learned our lesson and we do not                                 want to do major functionality changes                                 at the same time that we're doing a you                                 know drupal major version port but so                                 maybe port project initially but i want                                 to just put out there in the ether that                                 like that could be an awesome module                                 especially in drupal                                                 these in fields and and whatever else it                                 would be it'd be great if we somehow                                 have some of the energy to do that yeah                                 what we have in general on drupal.org is                                 the oldest continuously running Drupal                                 site and we have modules of different                                 vintages and you know project was made                                 before fields and cck and use existed a                                 big part of the Drupal                                                 upgrade to project was moving stuff like                                 alpha issue queue vioz into views that                                 was all custom queries and tables before                                 so that that made project a lot better                                 to deal with because there's no custom                                 views the same sort of thing can happen                                 with upgrade to Drupal                                                   of planning out that work figuring out                                 like what should we do ahead of time in                                 Drupal                                                            hopefully everything upgrades cleanly to                                 in c ck up cleanly to drupal                                            and the main project about specifically                                 the Derek writes the lead for that and I                                 I'm sure he's already planning this out                                 he's very well organized but he's not at                                 drupalcon this week but he but through                                 the project modulus Yukio kisses already                                 there's probably already a plan there I                                 don't know where it is off hand other                                 questions                                 the question was do we even need a                                 custom project module uh we probably                                 yeah there's there's a lot of the                                 functionality of project model that we                                 don't necessarily need okay triple six                                 wise there's stuff that can relatively                                 easily accomplished with proper fields                                 maybe maybe you could do it better a lot                                 of the things complicated because we                                 have like there's project this project                                 issue which handles the whole issue                                 keith english project releases which                                 handles of code so there's aspects of it                                 like for example packaging which is you                                 know a crucial part of project and                                 generates all of our tar balls but would                                 not be something that that we could                                 easily or should try to necessarily                                 readily express of cck a lot though of                                 the a lot of the metadata that we store                                 is something you probably could be moved                                 over to c ck i think actually one of the                                 biggest places though that that there's                                 an issue with that is um since we have                                 to store a running state for any given                                 issue and comments can change that state                                 like there's a special weird table that                                 stores transitional state as an issue                                 evolves and notes one of our state                                 change occurs i don't know all the                                 details of it but i think most things                                 probably could there are some things                                 that that do better is that do better is                                 custom but again that's one of the                                 reasons that you could do well with                                 project and d                                                          some custom things in the entity and the                                 rest is just feel dab'll any other                                 questions yep                                 that's in the big wall of texts that I                                 had up on the screen but yeah if you                                 read through it it has basically                                 everything ends up in issues in the                                 infrastructure project keels yeah so                                 head over to develop on our server you                                 can do local but the system is working                                 pretty well and yeah and yeah finally an                                 issue generally uh you know this stuff                                 is on our server and what I look for is                                 having some sort of plan like you                                 actually know you have something                                 specific to work on because these are                                 kind of limited resource we're running                                 out of disk space on under our BM that                                 runs all of these so we can't have a lot                                 these kind of laying around for non                                 specific purposes and it's generally                                 that yeah you've been active on                                 drupal.org in it looks like you'll be                                 able to get something you know completed                                 and ready to go and yeah so far approved                                 like probably ninety nine percent of
