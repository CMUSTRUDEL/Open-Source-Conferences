As designers/themers we've always been pressed with dealing with screen sizes. I remember the days when we had to worry how many of our site visitors used a 800x600 screen resolution and when we could stop accommodating those users, much like we have with IE6 users today.

The problem is that in the past years, and more and more every day, the web is shifting back to smaller devices and resolutions in the mobile market. iPhones, iPads, Android phones & tablets, crackberries and more are quickly becoming the primary source by which our users consume the internet and media. So today, once again, there IS actually a reason to consider designs that will work well on an 800 pixel wide resolution. What you ask? An iPad in portrait viewing mode, and other large screen tablets. But it's not time to focus on a single resolution, but to focus on the concepts that will let us build for them ALL at ONCE.

This session will introduce you to Adaptive Design and Responsive Layouts and how you can implement designs and themes that will work on ANY device without the need for multiple versions of a site all with different themes and designs.

This session will be broken into two main portions:

Introduction to Responsive Design/Layouts & Examples
This portion will cover the ins and outs of responsive concepts and how to apply those to Drupal, the shortcomings in Drupal (and most frameworks) that make Responsive concepts still a somewhat "hacky" solution, and how we can better improve upon core to make this better for the mobile web in the future.
Introduction to ONE technique to get you started using these concepts now...
This portion will cover how Omega implements Responsive/Adaptive concepts, and where the future of this project is going, and how you can begin using the framework today, and contribute to it for the future all while creating powerful themes for any device your users may be using.
Omega has moved to a mobile first approach on design and layout concepts, making it simple to quickly push out a mobile friendly version of ANY drupal site, with options now to use multiple grids based on the 960.gs framework, but sized to your choosing. It is possible now to target certain device capabilities and sizes to render content in new ways using CSS3 @media queries.

good so far                               what we can start off last day of                               sessions with something you'll something                               you'll remember my name is Jake shrine                               on drupal.org and ground rushing the                               internet humorous and today we're going                               to talk to you about actually I really                                wanted to change the title list but I                                had                                                                   literally we're really focusing on                                responsered by the time mobile first                                technologies and how to accomplish using                                google a lot of this other buzzwords                                that you do to change in the industry                                what they're to find ass but it all                                really boils down to the same thing                                okay so the person we're going to talk                                about is mobile how we doing the                                alliance in the ten minutes prior to the                                session sorry use a mobile or tablet                                device I'm your name use the desktop                                laptop black there's too many of them                                wasn't so sing at that some types of                                mobile devices a lot of times when we                                start thinking about what we want resent                                to mobile users first thing we're                                thinking about the kind of lonesome                                Rhodes people in this room are more                                likely carrying an Android or nitrile                                however mobile is not just Android and                                iOS I think most of us already know that                                but the smartphones that we carry are                                capable of doing lot of minutes you're                                capable of feeling how to build somebody                                over website it just shrinks it it looks                                ok you can zoom in pain but a huge                                percentage of e-books still using                                feature phones and these are low-end                                devices simply don't have the processing                                power only but maybe they can even this                                way JavaScript and they're only getting                                more really rendering a very simplistic                                page sometimes even with that success                                ask currently stands at least this was a                                couple months ago about                                               what percent of users or on smartphones                                that's said to be more of if you could                                be split by the end of this year but                                again with that being said we actually                                have a wide group of mobile devices that                                we need to cater to and you can look at                                it like maybe some of us do without six                                and now I don't want to build those but                                with a lot of countries you're not                                charming smart phones we really need to                                be able to focus on all kinds of devices                                there's one way to do to figure out what                                type of it like someone's using                                sent the content that's user agent                                detection and according to most people                                in most circumstances it's probably not                                in person at a time that is not the                                correct way to be doing things with tens                                in upon tens of thousands of user agents                                with the ability to fake your user agent                                we found some other type of your browser                                Firefox plug-in that water pretty much                                emulate anything that's not the way to                                we should be approaching mobile devices                                that's how you're going to get a very                                iphone specific website but not                                something that's actually going to cater                                to every life so this is where we come                                to mobile first and the problem has been                                that more often than not the mobile                                version of a website is the last thing a                                client wants a lot of times even the                                developer designer thinks about we've                                got a rich experience going on                                                                                                               ready what we want to be mobile too so                                now we have to go back and start hacking                                it apart and they can work we need to be                                thinking about the mobile version of the                                website right after that the lowest                                common denominator of anybody that's                                going to come to any website you build                                is on a feature phone is on a mobile                                phone so it's going to go from Egypt                                zone the smartphone to tablet and then                                finally somebody's on a laptop or                                desktop it's capable renderings and                                advanced things so we need to be                                thinking about the lowest common                                denominator first                                and some of the current statistics                                obviously everybody the nominee who                                 concedes everybody notice mobile flicks                                 work that's what we need to start                                 focusing on projected to be a billion                                 users by                                                           mobile users are increasing over desktop                                 clients by factor of                                                    will surpass the pc sales by the end of                                 this year the more we can be                                            iPhones the windows phone                                              mount that one so by the end of this                                 year they're going to be more people my                                 mobile devices and there will be dallas                                 or anything like that over half of the                                 current smartphone users spend more than                                                                                                     mobile applications how many of you fall                                 into that category least                                          thinking about mobile forces you to                                 focus on what we want to deliver to your                                 client we get carried away when                                 designing sites for the desktop they had                                 so much real estate to put all of these                                 ads to put all of this content related                                 stuff but when when it boils down to it                                 what are you really trying to accomplish                                 what are the three things on your                                 psychic most important so mobile                                 thinking about what a mobile user needs                                 to see makes you kind of conceptualize                                 differently so that you know that if                                 we're talking about a conference site                                 like drupalcon if you notice visiting                                 the site throughout the week every day                                 the homepage has changed to the current                                 date scheduled all the people that are                                 going to cited a draw we want that so                                 the same thing kind of applies in mold                                 what do you want somebody on that lowest                                 common denominator able to see so with a                                 little intro to the mobile self will                                 talk responsive web design and how that                                 plays into this workshop what is                                 responsive and it was originally defined                                 like a theme our coach as a practice of                                 using fluid grids flexible images and                                 media queries we're definitely enhance                                 of web page for different viewing                                 contest so there we go there's our                                 mobile there's our tablet in multiple                                 viewing blends together orientations and                                 then there's our big desktop some guy                                 with                                                                    definition and I agree and a couple                                 months after I gave actually the first                                 run of this dr. zelden posted something                                 that essentially says Eaton's definition                                 was great and that's what he came up                                 with the atoms would having a fluid grid                                 they had to use flexible images which is                                 going to max width in a new browser                                 Solis cable and the media queries if you                                 used any bit of JavaScript if you use                                 anything else that's not responsive                                 that's not that easy so there was a lot                                 of the adaptive or responsive there was                                 a lot of back and forth about globe                                 what's the difference what our does it                                 for quite a while I couldn't even tell                                 you and so what hits most kind of will                                 count you is that it's not the exact                                 approach doesn't necessarily have to be                                 a fluid great don't have to have media                                 queries in but it's the Indigo when we                                 get you being able to just deliver the                                 same website the different devices while                                 giving them all the appropriate the                                 record content the appropriate user                                 interface                                 some examples for those of you that are                                 unfamiliar order to help you get kind of                                 an idea the first one is going calm vol                                 ly and this is one of the first that i                                 know of great examples of responsive                                 design and as that first desktop so i                                 came up there's four columns you know                                 everything is you know designed really                                 simply point but i should continue to

                                very well raptly done and if we notice                                 the menu on these items and then when                                 the mobile version comes up here we see                                 that there make navigation from slim                                 down four times the most important for                                 things and the

            was the four kitchens website that they                                 did a few months back it does use the                                 fluid grid so as you start out of a                                 large resolution and scale your browser                                 down you're going to see these different                                 shifts in how be the primary items on                                 page layout and the bottom two you can                                 see how the navigation has become a                                 little different as well making it a                                 little more friend with your mobile                                 device and making it you're kind of in                                 delete button

same concept it's                                 fluid it was up to a                                                    and has a mobile version where                                 everything is now sacked out certain                                 elements are not displayed but if you if                                 you go to that URL and you scale down

desktop as soon as you get just a                                 little bit smaller than                                                goes what it's not important it looks                                 great on the desktop version the site                                 that doesn't even beyond the global                                 verge another one they were coming                                 drupalcamp New Hampshire it's going up                                 in a couple months has actually four                                 sizes                                                               mobile version I didn't actually spend                                 much time on the design for the mobile                                 you can see on the desktop versions                                 really slim navigation at the very top                                 looks like a little mini bar but when                                 you get to mobile you have some really                                 Jabbawockeez yeah it's just going to                                 make it easy for                                                                                                         become the site on a mobile device are                                 pretty much only the ones their camp                                 that recently acquia relaunched their                                 main site aqua calm using the mega there                                 are a couple of small response and                                 enhancements in here with more plan in                                 the future there's a few things that                                 kind of shift or fluid layout to get                                 down to a little bit better viewing on a                                 tablet they haven't actually done for                                 mobile version yet with time attorneys                                 so how do we get to this how we how do                                 we implement this on our own sites                                 good                                 there are quite a few ways that you can                                 implement these methods that you can                                 start delivering the same web page                                 that's enhanced depending on what what                                 devices review if we start with                                 javascript one of the best methods is                                 adapt jas by name is net benefit grant                                 achatz for a long time in                                              did that j/s does is on the i believe                                 the page load and then the browser                                 resize it continues to detect the size                                 of the screen and if you get below                                 certain point this is all configurable                                 foods in JavaScript sevens if it's below                                 a certain point it's going to switch the                                 CSS is using to the grid so instead of a                                                                                                         grid the benefits of this it does work                                 in all browsers as long as javascript is                                 turned on and that only becomes a                                 problem when we look at much older                                 feature phones that cannot handle the                                 JavaScript if you're not using a mobile                                 first approach with adapt KS you're                                 going to have problems on those                                 overcomes the CSS matter                                 using media queries which we're already                                 familiar with they've been around since                                 start of CSS to we've used media all                                 print screen display all those now we                                 had css                                                                way min or max device to it we're able                                 to use these to actually detect the                                 capabilities of our browser that's what                                 we're really wanting to look for we                                 don't care that's a blackberry years old                                 we want to know that they have                                           wide search that's all we want to know                                 the benefits of this it works in all                                 modern browsers so anything before ie                                  is not going to happen I'll be new                                 smartphones and even when I have it's                                 over years old understands media queries                                 just one the only the only real issue                                 here is dealing value the previous                                 version is of idea really if you have to                                 implement the same responsive layouts or                                 maybe you just go to some kind of                                 defaults any browser doesn't understand                                 css                                                                   them again the reason for mobile first                                 if you go to a whole mobile browsers                                 doesn't understand it just to say okay                                 I've already got my simplest version of                                 a page being mobile version and any                                 rabbit smart enough to look at is going                                 to understand                                 continue to enhance the page combining                                 the methods if you are going with css                                  media query about and you must add for                                 the previous versions of ie you can look                                 at respond Jas and what it essentially                                 does is a possible that is going to                                 hopefully never tested it I know some                                 people said they've had success with                                 what it's going to emulate to the media                                 queries in this over alpha to make it to                                 the whole version body understand kind                                 of like the html                                                        so that it ever change some of the                                 ejaculation alive so combining the                                 methods depending on your requirement to                                 be really because you've really cover                                 every day you should have any system                                 working appropriate we've been really                                 spend quite a bit of time here                                 discussing which one is right and no                                 matter what it really boils down to the                                 clients you're dealing with but more                                 importantly how you approach your                                 clients a lot of the reading I've been                                 doing a lot of the work that I've been                                 tuned in for clients is now from someone                                 who actually in a chance but a mobile                                 version is more important than pixel                                 perfect drop shadow in every browser                                 ever made across the waters it's more                                 important that they approach this                                 rapidly growing mobile market rather                                 than worrying about the details and                                 let's build on our way up let's go to                                 enhance so that once we get to be the                                 desktop version somebody's using Firefox                                                                                                       and put in a lot of great stuff targeted                                 to the contemporary route                                 how can we implement these now in Drupal                                 the first methods the methods I have                                 just discussed are great you can use                                 them you can start building out a                                 one-off being for a client with these no                                 prob if you're looking for something a                                 little more our box there's currently                                 one basting the dribble for Drupal                                      has already tackled all this has already                                 handled this and taking all of these                                 approaches into account I've actually                                 been working on a metaphor about two                                 years on Tuesday during three scheme                                 hope I actually launched the stable                                 version but i'll be talking about some                                 future sward and it's really grown from                                 something that started off s my own need                                 to just feel thing that I started with                                 for every project do now becoming                                 something that it's finally gained a lot                                 community sport has a lot of people                                 contributing to the project and hasn't                                 even had someone come in practically                                 rewrite all of nothing Greg code and                                 make it worse everybody one actually                                 using some of the features                                 first off obviously responsive grids out                                 of the box it ships with seven                                           pixel grid fluid grid and uses the                                 mobile first concept so if you throw                                 your browser all the way down clean                                 install your all your region second                                 plates you're gonna have perfect looking                                 basic mobile site ready to go we didn't                                 go out your your net shift enhance it                                 different layouts different sizes as you                                 move along mobile first approach some of                                 the great rights that have happened over                                 the past six months from Triple Crown                                 Chicago the code was a fool namely                                 rewritten there's some fans cashing                                 going on really sweet sings I work some                                 I don't know how to if and crazy living                                 things that are all now on everything's                                 performing well and CSS aggregation and                                 when we were building out their                                 responses the responsive features all of                                 a sudden we had that the difference sees                                 us includes in the header it gets each                                 media query in Drupal we get media media                                 all and men with for                                                   create its own group during the page                                 bill so it was way too many so what we                                 do now once you turn on CSS CSS                                 aggregation in Drupal it all gets                                 compressed into one everything is                                 written                                 really and you don't have a thousand                                 employees trying to acknowledge all this                                 every zone and region is easily                                 configurable there are three main page                                 elements and one thing that this theme                                 does you will probably never have a need                                 at hdil again I have been actually over                                 a year now so we have three main page                                 level elements in the html                                          header the section which holds all the                                 main content and employer you can place                                 a zone which in amazonian concept that                                 came along about the year here half ago                                 that the zone is a container for the                                 region's the region's needed to be group                                 so that any type of grit properties or                                 any type of man yourself would work with                                 that so currently in place walks in the                                 region this is the same thing for region                                 six regions in himself so you can place                                 any of these zones any of these regions                                 anywhere you want to place on the fly in                                 the back end true to the                                          concepts that amusing for many years now                                 you have the ability to in each group of                                 regions again zone you're able to pick                                 which one you want displayed first on                                 the page in which one you want to say                                 first in the source order and you can                                 order any region that way anyway one and                                 that's right for the content verge SEO                                 and but it really wants their content                                 perch on page that also helps move first                                 if you start them attacking your content                                 you want to be at the top we've added a                                 few things that kind of simplify adding                                 in special CSS special JavaScript                                 because i was n to use gates where I                                 would go about certain CSS javascript                                 file later didn't want everywhere on the                                 site it didn't want include it in size                                 or style sheets or extremist elements                                 that Drupal themes have fault so we have                                 some new grid arrays in                                 not into a file that allow you to define                                 these and then enabled or disabled that                                 by looking sending Julie so this is                                 great because a lot of people that are                                 using like or are using any basin for                                 that matter each company kind of builds                                 out their home something of that it's                                 very basically already has all their                                 custom suites in it it's ready to go yes                                 it's a little more configured to their                                 liking to get started with this makes                                 that easy because you know maybe you're                                 racing had a couple extra jobs sheriff                                 enhancements if I don't need a client we                                 need ugly turned off you now have the                                 ability as I mentioned no motor comes                                 with                                                                  can now define your own grits the site                                 change out in the background is the one                                 week dot in                                                      generate any grid section any gutter                                 with someone so for those that don't                                 like                                                                     to you can do whatever you like and the                                 basic implements it you can put this in                                 your got info file which is essentially                                 define a couple things and you have your                                 own grid but you can now define only                                 equerry for and are able to use that                                 however you see fit one of one of the                                 biggest thing do this is kind of silly                                 for the slide presentation but all the                                 biggest things we've ever requested it's                                 equalize regions and walks that's in                                 there now that works quite if charm the                                 biggest thing would say except by Ron                                 settings interface and I'll use the                                 words of simple lists some people say                                 that someone there's a couple hundred                                 form elements that you can configure do                                 a lot of things with but as you get to                                 dig in it's really quite simple to                                 little region to another zone and a lot                                 of the things we've been talking about                                 here in London are how we're going to                                 take the next step how we're going to                                 build a drag drop interface allowing you                                 to resize scale regions on the fly drag                                 and drop in two different locations                                 either through a back-end interface or                                 potentially live from the site so that's                                 a lot of this opportunity or non but the                                 usage of this is actually besides a                                 little bit of a little bit of                                 documentation it's in this at this point                                 there's now over                                                         got usually                                                             IRC every day there's a lot of support a                                 lot of people out there using some of                                 the sexes are using omega not all of                                 these music digital seven as well                                 there's a lot of large sites running oh                                 my god with a lot of traffic lot of one                                 less ability                                 ah                                 now some talked about the mobile mole                                 first and responsive there are some                                 places where currently dribble seven and                                 we hoping we fixin your rate increases                                 keynote now there's actually a mobile or                                 potentially going to be a global                                 initiative that will handle this and                                 responsive responsive ideas in core when                                 I actually made this slide and care of                                 that initiative but the two things that                                 are really going to make this happen are                                 the contacts quarter shiv and would you                                 believe design initiative the problem                                 with the mobile first right now Drupal                                 is well if you say that your biggest                                 version of your website's well my texts                                 but your smallest of their work at                                     small something and fine what happens                                 when you have imagery set that the image                                 is a bullet of age                                                       can use the fluid images which is just                                 going to scale it down but you still set                                 your mobile user an image of this fire                                 cake and unit neck and that's a big                                 problem there's ways on one off case you                                 can do this you can use some drop                                 JavaScript you can load a low-res                                 version first and then do some                                 determination to know that okay you                                 found out yes they aren't experienced so                                 let's feed them the larger version but                                 there's a lot of things here where                                 within web services and contexts gorget                                 that it seems like we're going to be                                 able to better understand what's what's                                 your questioning the page what we really                                 want and provide the context that let us                                 know what we can use and if you want to                                 share an entirely different page to hold                                 user that might be possible                                 originally I said worked on the American                                 for about two years about

                        screen here so on the second page on the                                 site all the links have been put in                                 there the entire session outline I will                                 avoid slides at some point as well but                                 all the all the posts that are mentioned                                 specimens contact information all                                 cool                                 i would like to introduce you guys some                                 gel tell us a little lot she'll smarter

         I actually have member speaking a long                                 time i was about for the past week                                 and you offer me come back                                 alright you're saying can we use that                                 can that be the only German information                                 so the question what's that with all                                 different laptop sizes some older self                                 all these things is using Mac's Whitman                                 with the CSS screen sizes is that the                                 best way to only way that we should be                                 paying attention to if you are kind of                                 paying attention to the guys that                                 created this tall or responsive                                 everything that really seems to be                                 enough I mean that laptop that through                                 whatever reason has                                                      know it's probably a music box like that                                 so I can't imagine what advanced browse                                 or its using so we already need its own                                 simplified version if a client is really                                 willing to some client may have ninety                                 percent of their customers made me using                                 that little jumpy laptop in this case I                                 mean then that's when still something                                 like to watch detection may be                                 appropriate but the problem with that is                                 what the device detection is it takes so                                 much time not me clients really have a                                 time page                                                              paid for a special android version what                                 doesn't work on anything else we're only                                 this one specific I really think it's                                 enough in the only team actually we have                                 like fall back for the IU six seven                                 eight it doesn't understand media                                 queries and doesn't let know what size                                 screens on accepted on mobile in like                                 six seven eight it will just display the                                 default Rick won't you set in the                                 interface so it would just get                                       think it's really enough to just a                                 Douglas your insides currently but in a                                 month that may change back see                                 different angles that are inside                                 right yeah so job                                 is there any way to test the different                                 sizes okay there may be a lot of better                                 ones that I don't even know myself I                                 currently just use every now and then I                                 fire up the IE windows phone                                            and I don't really worry about Android                                 iPhone and I know they're pretty capable                                 and I need actually just need to throw a                                 lot because you can grab and resize all                                 the way down to                                                     can't get down to the really small that                                 depends                                                                  most of aces to know that you know in                                 approving their layout that you have                                 most of what you want the only drawback                                 to that is if you're using a lot of                                 other advanced I'll Flay css                                            and drop shadows that may not work on                                 the mobile in fig you're doing that                                 chrome so it looked like they were but I                                 tend to do it really simply just with                                 just was the novel technique a lot                                 stronger                                 actually just a week we can have to go                                 we finally got some patches in for an                                 old support that will handle I don't                                 personally handle too much ever anymore                                 it will handle I think anything that's                                 nested inside the panel and handle the                                 right people in grid classes based on                                 their container elements so it should                                 work well and there's a couple more                                 patches maybe for a couple little cheeks                                 in that what it does work for those that                                 are so easy games absolutely that's a                                 great question it's been                                               kind of talk about it because again you                                 have                                                                     screen and you have a slide show that is                                 the full length of that you're going to                                 need an image cache preset slope                                 excellence and those are large images                                 that me notes are no small task so what                                 happens if you're sailing down and we                                 were loading ten images in the slideshow                                 but you're so so let's say to that total                                 for new megs of image data that we're                                 perfectly capable or on a laptop in SF                                 that's no problem together with usually                                 but once you get down a mobile what do                                 you do because on going back sequin                                 markets definition of the flexible grid                                 or fluid grid flexible images flexible                                 images something can also posted on the                                 blog that all it does is add CSS max                                 width property to every image and so as                                 you scale in this case it would sail                                 down what perfect there's some                                 JavaScript that handles and lower                                 trousers which still send the whole                                 thing that's where I think I've had                                 several discussions on it so far this                                 week if there's a huge concern for that                                 which honestly that really should be the                                 best way to do it using a mobile first                                 approach is you're going to take and                                 load the lowest resolution                                 you can so if you've got for Responsive                                 size that you're dealing with you're                                 going to want to have                                                    load your small toe might fall and once                                 the page is loaded there's some                                 JavaScript fires and Omega determines                                 which lay out there in knows your mobile                                 node you're in a wide turns where maybe                                 you can use that fire off and                                 potentially replace those images with                                 the high res only if it's the bigger                                 that stuff is not built in because its                                 way to your specific to a single use                                 case right we have a lot of the way to                                 really make that portable yeah because                                 everybody's image presets or anything                                 different you can't really make those                                 assumptions so on the one off it's                                 possible to do some of that and for me                                 on the couple that I've really                                 implemented so far this waves version I                                 probably should have done that as well                                 super important at the time so I'm just                                 saying what one's a ton a ton of extra                                 data but that's kind of a problem that                                 in general jubal happens regardless of                                 what you're using right not much of a                                 way unless you're really taking a lot of                                 time                                 doesn't say                                 black                                 the head was your question on supporting                                 the bandwidth what that's it okay um                                 well I don't know if we go to attack                                 with idea I don't know how you would                                 really go

the people                                 I've been in contact with are excited                                 about this and if they're going to be                                 plenty of clients that are not on board                                 with and I family didn't take much more                                 time a little bit my first is not                                 actually took quite a bit more but it                                 was just me playing around with some                                 other success stuff                                 all this can be done really quickly set                                 aside a global you know CSS to live to                                 your mobile version and your mobile

                          it's right there could be some clients                                 are going to be like you're crazy out of                                 you know don't want that and a lot are                                 really excited by the potential and                                 mobile downsizing things like that                                 serving targeted versions or layout                                 students to their comments                                 is Drupal aware questions when it in oh                                 my gosh your shifter is agosun                                         when it switches this drivel where know                                 the there's a JavaScript there's a                                 JavaScript identifiers that would                                 potentially be able to go in booze and                                 custom code google Janelle and that's                                 against some of the exception of having                                 based on now well if I'm on that                                 portrait mode tablet version maybe I                                 wanted totally get rid of some regions                                 and right now just do that quickly and                                 CSS let me damage will send it too much                                 baby so that's where hopefully some of                                 these things in typically come out                                 you're gonna be able to wear some of                                 these things really quickly and a box                                 but for now it's really not but if the                                 use case requires it to be a little                                 bitter custom                                 ah                                 each of the layouts in any the whole                                 point Green Grid you can get your own                                 status five so it might fall they're                                 called it mobiles I searched so it's off                                 and a little CSS everything with mobile                                 goes there everything's just falling                                 sidewalk including mobile when you first                                 turn it on there's an arrow normal and                                 what each of those has its own costly                                 pssy there's also a default that applies                                 to all three of those so if your mobile                                 is totally different you can use your                                 default you're starting to finding stuff                                 that's global on all the responsive                                 versions and then in each of those                                 specific ones if there are over rights                                 and my slideshow example is the perfect                                 one so in the normal slideshow should                                 only need for hundreds of why when you                                 have the wide it should be                                            can chain this impressed that right over                                 right if you go pop rather than what you                                 should always be the tradition is build                                 out the desktop site first and override                                 to get back to mobile data rate you're                                 just don't universe                                 can't tell you honestly I usually build                                 my own fly shows I have found my weblog                                 cleaning out the box with those I                                 haven't noticed any issues like in the                                 queue really specific to any of those                                 the biggest the biggest thing is they're                                 not responsive ready so that's where you                                 kind of have to take into account either                                 that flexible image set up with max                                 width property and CSS or using using                                 somehow job triple                                                       higher depending on there really                                 shouldn't be any issues yes if you load                                 it up like fault and you're in chat                                 reset is                                                                 to learn a smaller one without any                                 adjustments yeah external after page so                                 each you know element like that you                                 really kind of have to pay special                                 attention to actually work throughout                                 each of those responsible                                 library                                 xml now put them in the comments made or                                 denigrate so there are some ways out                                 there it really is possible there's                                 we're okay well that's a good kind of                                 the problem that right now Google's                                 underwear right now you know we're not                                 we're not really spending their data I                                 haven't done that on a couple things and                                 I'm simply using CSS I if I got eight                                 items in my name and big thing before L                                 or just contact form about us I'll just                                 on the mobile CSS to the data tab not                                 the most efficient way but the powers                                 you're blushing                                 as I don't move display none it's really                                 a good question and that's I don't think                                 this point has a giant impact i don't                                 know i gave up on paying attention to                                 SEO years ago but usually the site sick                                 what up do well enough of it a lot of to                                 hear somebody who's an SEO expert really                                 get into some of this i think the                                 biggest problem would be is if it's                                 dribble war where checks on these                                 questions pointing to hear the world                                 where what's going on neutral and mobile                                 device but you're still at example.com                                 not in God's example you're on the main                                 website but because it knew you're on a                                 mobile device if it sent me with yelling                                 down page that I me what really affects                                 a lot of SEO I think that's where the                                 real problems lie anything else just                                 using element this all over you know                                 display none if you feel it I don't                                 think that's good                                 investments is to put life what was all                                 very last part                                 right on the first part of what your                                 question is kind of not there were any                                 real stats on what mobile mobile and                                 commerce or do anything like how many                                 people are doing things like that                                 actually had a couple of exceptions                                 earlier the week and I know here in the                                 UK it's pretty big I've bought it                                 personally I bought a couple things on                                 my android phone but I think right now                                 the numbers are so slim because you get                                 to your honor iphone and you get to a                                 version of full website it's just been                                 scaled down you're pinching to zoom and                                 everywhere you go it's not really usable                                 to get me to buy things quickly so I                                 think that's something that needs to be                                 addressed in these mobile designs that                                 make it so that consumers can have a                                 good user experience quickly on their                                 mobile edit our checkout done and I                                 think that is a hard as impossible it                                 just really hasn't been tackled nobody's                                 really i mean i've been going draw I'm                                 sure there's hundreds of websites out                                 there that have a great mobile commerce                                 options and as far as the usability                                 selling its varied enabled and card                                 where do you put it or how do you make                                 sure its prominent when you're on a                                 mobile version when the above the fold                                 is now much smaller I think if that's                                 why to do first if you that add a card                                 about maybe the first thing in the                                 content that may be the first thing                                 about in the book the title of the                                 product the node and then if you throw a                                 lot then you can with CSS or do you know                                 any other no trickery move it somewhere                                 else you and now I can be something big                                 and lower now it's really obvious on the                                 desktop the mountain boat I think it all                                 comes down to you know designer thinking                                 the right way                                 and a theme to implement the right                                 weight so that in mobile it shows up                                 appropriately Asian work it's not much                                 time more questions I need a cigarette                                 you're doing revisit the section page                                  their survey link they're rated actually                                  on presentation park and hotel and I'll                                  be around after the question home to                                  come up please flip it out thank you                                  that's the date
