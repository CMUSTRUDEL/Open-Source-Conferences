Title: DrupalCon London 2011: BUILDING YOUR DRUPAL PRODUCTS THE RIGHT WAY
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Kristof Van Tomme
Every day more and more companies start using Drupal and the day will come when it'll make all the difference if you are more than just-another-Drupal-shop.

Drupal is a very innovative community, and we've got a wide range of companies and individuals that are constantly pioneering new technologies. For several of these pioneers this is a conscious differentiation strategy, an attempt to increase personal or company karma. Commercially however this innovation has not always been particularly successful.

In this presentation I want to share with you the aha moment I got when I first read about customer development, lean startups and business model generation. I'll explain each of these concepts, how we started applying them at Pronovix and put them into a broader Drupal ecosystem context and why any Drupal project you run should be driven by validated customer demand.

In the 2nd part of the presentation I'll explain why I think we need to start massively diversify the way we do business in Drupal and how an ethical Drupal appstore could achieve this without damage to our existing community.

Intended audience

	                              hi I'm a kristef on Toma and I'm going                               to talk to you today about products and                               about how to build them in the right way                               and the right way I think is in an agile                               way I think a lot of you probably are                               doing projects for customers in an agile                               way but maybe you should be thinking                               about running your products also in an                               HL way not just the development but                                everything like everything and that's                                what this presentation is going to be                                about is it's cannibal now I've been                                moving it a bit so if you just as a                                small clarification throughout my slides                                you're going to see barcodes basically                                what I've been playing with and this is                                also one of my minimal Viable products                                experiments is to see if people will use                                barcodes during presentations if they                                can scan them and so the bar code that                                you see here if you scan it it will send                                you to Twitter to go and retweet                                whatever I wrote there the other bar                                codes throughout the presentation will                                send you to a little websites which is                                like something where we've got some of                                the materials from this presentation I                                think you can go and comment and on the                                individual slides so it's a couple of                                experiments that we're running and about                                me I'm a crystal phantom oh I'm the CEO                                and co-founder of pro Novak's that's a                                Belgian Hungarian company so I'm I'm the                                like I used to say I am the Belgium I'm                                the Belgium from Hungary but now I'm the                                Belgian from Hungary who is again living                                in Belgium and if that doesn't totally                                blow your mind I'm a bar engineer so                                I've been bringing a bit of a different                                perspective to the Drupal world I think                                so there's also one of the reasons why                                I'm very active in or event organisation                                so I don't write much code                                I don't write code but i try to                                overcompensate doing all kinds of other                                stuff some part of the drupal                                association and i don't know if you know                                this guy anybody recognizes him he's um                                he's actually he's quite a famous                                investor well actually his partner is                                really famous but this guy is really                                interesting because he's been saying                                some very interesting stuff about mental                                models mental models meaning simple                                stories or simple simplifications of a                                certain idea or concept that can help                                you to think differently about your                                realities right so and and one of the                                things that he's saying is so there's if                                you if you go to that bit ly you'll find                                a report others there's a couple of                                articles out there we're in which he                                stuck well in which they interviewed him                                and where he's talking about some of the                                mental models he's using to do his                                investments very interesting stuff he                                gets quite some of his models come from                                biology also um that's maybe that's                                partially my bias because I see like who                                somebody finally who's also talking                                about environmental and like ecosystems                                and and thinking about that in business                                and like kind of legitimizing it because                                people used to do that in the past but                                then it became a bit of a no-no but I                                think there's a lot of stuff you can                                learn by looking at ecosystems and                                biological systems and like reapplying                                it they help you think in a different                                way and what my backgrounds there's                                quite some of that stuff in this                                presentations today so what's the                                problem homegrown CMS's like I think a                                lot of people here in this room started                                out building their own little CMS in PHP                                like long time ago they thought it was                                brilliant and and and then you know hits                                the issues of maintaining ability and                                scalability and all that other stuff and                                and then and then started looking for                                something else and probably that's how                                you ended up with Drupal but homegrown                                CMS's are a lot like sand castles                                they're there it's fun to build them but                                they break down really easy like one                                wave comes in they're all gone and you                                know it's they just keep crumbling down                                and it's it's it's a lot of hard work                                and and then if you if you look at what                                 has happened with Drupal Drupal has come                                 in and basically been well some people                                 will say this is too harsh but I think                                 actually Drupal has been quite a                                 disruptive force in this landscape                                 because basically what what what I've                                 seen and seen happening around me is                                 that all these people that had their own                                 little CMS's suddenly their customers                                 started asking for Drupal specifically                                 like okay we don't really want your                                 stuff but or well they didn't say that                                 but could you build this in Drupal and I                                 hear this now coming up more and more so                                 basically what's going on is that this                                 wave of of of open source CMS including                                 Drupal it's coming in and and is like a                                 tsunami and that's a really powerful                                 image now especially after what happened                                 in Japan but it's coming in as its                                 tsunami and it's basically leveling the                                 playing ground and maybe not destroying                                 but at least removing a lot of the value                                 of these custom CMS's and that's a lot                                 of diversity that is being lost it's                                 like an extinction-level event it's like                                 us humans doing this stuff to the planet                                 like destroying a lot of species it's                                 not necessarily a bad thing but it's                                 something to think about there's a lot                                 of value that was in there in that                                 diversity to some extent right because                                 Drupal has brings a lot of different                                 value um but there's a lot of value that                                 that has been leveled and there's a new                                 level playing ground that is being                                 created                                 and now my next step is but if you look                                 at Drupal and if you're like a pure                                 Drupal shop like doing only like while                                 doing basically anything people ask you                                 to do in Drupal like without trying to                                 diversify just being the random Drupal                                 shop doing all kinds of brochure sites                                 all kinds of different sites not really                                 picky about what you do and you're still                                 building sandcastles they're really                                 pretty they're really beautiful they're                                 really big they're really robust they're                                 going to stand way longer than all the                                 stuff that discuss some CMS's we're                                 doing but they're still sandcastles                                 because like you're still you're still                                 vulnerable that's what i want to say                                 because after the the disruption wave                                 has gone after this big tsunami of open                                 source has really leveled the playing                                 field after everybody will be doing                                 Drupal or some other open sea open                                 source CMS we are small shops because I                                 think most of the people here are small                                 Drupal shops will be competing with the                                 elephants and once it's a playing level                                 once it's been leveled the playing field                                 it's easy for the elephants to commit                                 and that's what's happening now actually                                 so now building the tension building                                 drama luckily we've got this guy Drupal                                 buck or Drupal Roche and recent reduced                                 him it's a little fellow he's like                                 unkillable he's a bit of a eat                                 everything he'll he'll take any project                                 and build your website for it and he's a                                 bit of a bottom feeder I would say and                                 he's hard to kill but not necessarily                                 relevant so meaning it's it's so diverse                                 and so adaptable like he can he can be                                 in any kind of ecosystem but he's not                                 necessarily the you know the shiny birds                                 in that ecosystem                                 but if you look at insects and here come                                 the mental models if you look at Inter                                 insects there they've got there is this                                 really cool building model because                                 insects like they're everywhere like                                 really literally everywhere there's a                                 couple of Nicias like the see that they                                 had a bit of harder time getting into                                 but else if you look around you'll see                                 in sex everywhere and the reason for                                 that is they built on a really modular                                 building building model so if you look                                 at them they've got wings they got boss                                 they gets this mouthpiece and they can                                 really easily adapt this and reconfigure                                 it to adapt themselves to a new                                 ecosystem and Drupal is a lot like that                                 it's got a lot of these little module                                 modular bits and pieces that are that                                 can easily be repurposed and further                                 enhanced to fit a specific niche so                                 we're we're good at adapting to                                 different niches but if you want to be                                 successful in a niche you have to go all                                 the way you have to really adapt you                                 have to diversify you have to become a                                 different kind of bug not just the roach                                 not just a Drupal Roach and that's not                                 meant to to any user on Drupal a dog or                                 anything like that but meaning like you                                 you have to you have to adapt yourself                                 to specific feeding habits you have to                                 become I don't know specialist in church                                 websites we've got a couple of those you                                 have to be specialized in SEO or or                                 something you have to get away from just                                 being just another Drupal shops because                                 there's so many out there already and                                 there and more and more are coming if                                 you want to be something special if you                                 want to be realistic sex successful you                                 have to adapt you have to change you                                 have to be specially adapted to certain                                 environment because but and again even a                                 nice niche is again still a little wave                                 so it has all the same dynamics of the                                 open source waves so like if you're                                 building if you're building                                 distributions like drupal distributions                                 that's probably not a very good way of                                 doing this because what you're doing is                                 you're creating another open source                                 product that will do the same thing to                                 that very specific niche like be the                                 wave of change that destroy some value                                 from some competitors and builds value                                 for Drupal ecosystem but it's again a                                 level playing field everybody can play                                 there once you've built a distribution                                 anybody can take it and run with it and                                 do the awesome stuff that you wanted to                                 do so you need something more than just                                 a distribution you need a business model                                 you need a sustainable business model                                 who knows this graph yeah some few                                 people okay this is the business model                                 canvas it's awesome it's just plain                                 awesome because it's it's a really good                                 tool it's a really good model to help                                 you think about your business like it                                 asks it's not like you know writing a                                 business plan business plans are so                                 passé nobody like you don't want to go                                 and write a business plan because                                 business plans yeah nobody really                                 believes in that anyway anymore a                                 business model though is a tool not so                                 much as a communication tool it's a                                 thinking tool it's like I use mind maps                                 all the time and I realized that some                                 some sort of creative thinking I can't                                 do without mind maps like I'm more                                 efficient if I use it this tool is like                                 that this tool will help you think in                                 creative ways about your business                                 because it asks the right kind of                                 questions it's a it has these different                                 areas key partners I won't go in detail                                 here but if you like go and search it on                                 the web you'll find a lot of stuff about                                 it there's even a really good book about                                 it I'll show you that in a minute and if                                 you're building a business you should be                                 looking at this now I said that it's a                                 tool to help you think what I mean with                                 that is that you should not just fill                                 this out and then put it in a closet                                 like what you would do with a business                                 plan and like never look back at it                                 until maybe next year or in two years                                 and then                                 man you should be using it as an active                                 document like every week you look back                                 at it and you fill in the stuff that                                 you've learned about your products about                                 your customers and you do in your new                                 iteration and you keep updating it to to                                 make it like adapted to your current                                 understanding of your business so it's                                 like a really good brainstorming tool to                                 help you think about where you're                                 heading how you're doing and what what                                 kind of business you would be able to                                 build the URL that's there that's a                                 google doc that I made from it so you                                 can just if you if you take that it's a                                 it's a template you can just it's open                                 just make a clone make that one private                                 and and you can use it with your                                 colleagues who might not be in the same                                 location as you this is the book that                                 was talking about it's really useful                                 because it's it kind of explains how you                                 can use the business model canvas it was                                 interesting for me that you can you                                 can't get it in a digital formats but                                 once you buy it you'll see that it has                                 all these nice pictures you don't want                                 that in digital format um now let's                                 let's go back a bit to lean startups so                                 you've seen this business model that was                                 I was hinting at it's that you could use                                 that to like reiterate and to like built                                 further on on your your understanding of                                 your business well what I'm hinting at                                 there is that is it the concept of a                                 lean startup and what is agile lean all                                 this stuff it's all about learning                                 everything like everything that lean is                                 it's basically it's a way to get faster                                 feedback to evolve faster to learn                                 faster from from a changing environment                                 from way it's uncomplete information                                 about your customers about your business                                 model about your markets product                                 whatever and to basically adapt to that                                 information on a lean way that's that's                                 for me that's what it's agile and                                 there's this whole movement going on                                 right now and if you didn't know about                                 it yet you should really go and start                                 reading about it because there's a lot                                 of interesting stuff there                                 about lean startups and how you can you                                 can use this kind of methodology to                                 instead of trying to build a product and                                 start today and then in healthy air                                 finish it and then find out that your                                 customer actually doesn't want it build                                 a minimal valuable product today                                 something small something prototype go                                 to the customer get feedback do a new                                 iteration new iteration new iteration                                 that's the basic concept and I think we                                 as a Drupal community have been or well                                 I claim guilty we've been we've been                                 pretty bad at that because what what                                 what we traditionally well in beginning                                 what what we would do with rely oh we                                 got to school idea we're just going to                                 like spend a couple of months                                 programming and then go to people and                                 then oh no it doesn't work or or yeah                                 this is actually cool it's really cool                                 technology and thank you thank you for                                 developing this I like basically to be                                 able to learn if there's actually a                                 business in the ideas that you have and                                 to be able to do that you really have to                                 go with a lean kind of methodology and                                 the first way to do that is to get out                                 of the building you can't you can't                                 learn about your customers by just                                 sitting behind your desk brainstorming                                 you have you like you might think that                                 you're our only sentience and you know                                 everything about a certain segment or a                                 certain product it's not true forget it                                 you have to go out you have to talk with                                 people because they're going to ask you                                 really weird questions and give you new                                 ideas that will so totally change your                                 understanding of your problem space that                                 it will have an enormous influence on                                 what you're building if you don't do                                 that you're you're going to be caught                                 out because this is the new this is the                                 new standards like this is what's most                                 tech startups or this is what the new                                 wave of tech startups are doing they're                                 all going out doing this I Chou lien                                 kind of methodology and actually                                 learning from the customers they're                                 doing customer development so they're                                 they're developing their understanding                                 of their customers and that's a really                                 good book about that well basically this                                 is a short version and this one is was                                 digitally available so I could get it on                                 the kindle store but actually the book                                 that they're getting most of their                                 information from is four steps to                                 epiphany I don't know if you've read                                 that but that's really good stuff but if                                 you want it for the flight back home you                                 can just get this one on on the kindle                                 store what's a minimal valuable product                                 i already slightly touched on that this                                 is a troubled and in my company we've                                 got the saying what would the tribe even                                 be like or if you if i don't know if                                 there's hungarians in a room no like                                 there's a papa dosh that's a hint Gary                                 words they use it for low-cost airlines                                 and it actually means wooden benches so                                 like what would be the foppish way of                                 building the first product so instead of                                 trying to put all the features you think                                 you could put in the thing try to focus                                 on your first build and the next two                                 consecutive builds try to focus on what                                 is the minimal thing like what is like                                 what can I build today what can I get                                 out today put it online and get feedback                                 from customers it's not going to be your                                 final product everybody knows that right                                 it's not going to be having all the                                 whistles and bells it's going to be                                 something really small it might even be                                 just a survey it might be just a                                 registration form but you can do that                                 today if you're thinking about building                                 a product tonight you can have a middle                                 viable product or tomorrow or well you                                 know it's it's a bit busy on rubicon but                                 the basic message is this you should not                                 don't ever try to build your final                                 product from day one like I've said this                                 a couple of times I'll repeat it a                                 couple of times don't make that mistake                                 there's a lot of people that I've done                                 that don't make it because you're going                                 to race a lot of efforts and you're                                 going to build something that nobody                                 wants because the thing that people want                                 it's not what you think they want it's                                 something probably a little bit                                 different now here we come back to                                 Drupal because Drupal is really good at                                 minimal Viable products like I've heard                                 so many stories of people that ran out                                 and say like yeah we're stalking I was                                 talking with this developer company and                                 they were going to make me my project                                 for like I don't know how many thousands                                 or tens of thousands of dollars and then                                 I started looking at Drupal and I                                 started like dropping in a couple of                                 modules and you know two days later I                                 had like this thing and it's doing like                                 almost everything that I wanted to do                                 and it didn't cost me a dime and well                                 except for the time of course so Drupal                                 is really good at building minimal                                 Viable products because they got all                                 these stuff that like even if if you                                 come like even if you're doing something                                 that's not web technology you could                                 build quite a lot of mineral valuable                                 products using Drupal because you got                                 web forums you got registration you can                                 get feedback you can get information                                 from your customers and then if you're                                 doing a tech startup there's a bunch of                                 modules that will give you a lot of                                 specific functionality that you can                                 actually go and build the actual product                                 with but even that will probably be not                                 too expensive the trap there again is if                                 you're a developer you're gonna say oh                                 I'm going to make this module right                                 don't don't go and try to build your own                                 module or and unless you really know                                 what you're doing and it's like you know                                 that it's going to cost you a day or two                                 try to use the existing stuff first and                                 and and move on from there another                                 really good minimal Viable Product                                 builder is Drupal gardens if you're if                                 you're about everybody here our Drupal                                 estas so you could run it yourself but                                 like if you need quick feedback                                 this is really easy and it's really                                 inexpensive and it's just click click                                 and you know you don't even have to go                                 and mess with modules so that's                                 something to think about another key                                 term in agile startups is pivots you                                 know in basketball you can pivot where                                 you keep one foot on the grounds you can                                 turn around seen that now in in lean                                 startups that means that you can you can                                 take everything you've learned before                                 and change in the direction where you                                 think you've got the best market                                 potential so instead of instead of like                                 like dropping everything so you're not                                 changing business you're making a pivot                                 your you're taking you've learned a                                 bunch of stuff from your minimal Viable                                 products like him you know a couple of                                 iterations couple of weeks you've                                 learned a whole lot of stuff most likely                                 when you have a new idea you will not                                 end up building that idea if you would                                 have if you would have just gone build                                 it you would have ended up building that                                 idea but it wouldn't have been the right                                 thing because when you start doing this                                 this this customer development you'll                                 find out that people actually want                                 different things and and you'll be able                                 or you'll find out that there's no money                                 in a certain thing like like for example                                 what I am you see everybody should have                                 gotten one of these on their chair you                                 can get these at the microsoft boot this                                 is one of our minimal Viable products                                 that we've built basically what we                                 thought was wouldn't it be cool if you                                 could make a QR codes that you can                                 assign on the spot so you got a booklet                                 of these things in your pocket then you                                 just pull out one stick it on something                                 and then we thought like oh this is                                 going to be great it's like big consumer                                 markets we're going to be the next well                                 I don't know localized Twitter kind of                                 thing or something or something digital                                 will be lots of fun then we started                                 really thinking about it's getting                                 feedback from people build a first                                 prototype we start realizing that this                                 is not going to work                                 where first of all the there's a lot of                                 there's a lot of legal difficulties                                 because you're the responsible publisher                                 so you don't want to go and create                                 booklets random booklets that you just                                 people can print out themselves and like                                 put on stuff and and then they come                                 after you because you you know it's                                 pointing to your website so we started                                 like we made a pivot and and then we                                 came up with this which is a merchandise                                 so built merchandise that has a unique                                 bar code so that every sticker that                                 you've got here is unique so you when                                 you scan it you get to an assigned page                                 you can say where it should redirect you                                 save it next time somebody scans it's                                 they redirected to that page and their                                 theme then the drupalcon theme so we                                 tried this where we're looking at it but                                 now what we've learned doing this like                                 in a small way not to like ooh we go all                                 the way is learned that actually we're                                 probably not the right company to do                                 this one then because this one requires                                 a lot of sales so we learned a lot of                                 stuff along the way and it was lots of                                 fun of course but but what I want to say                                 is like being able to make pivots and                                 and figure out like take you whatever                                 you learned and then act on that is                                 really important so those were like the                                 basic concepts of fleeing startups now I                                 want to spend a little bit of time on on                                 this thing I don't know has anybody read                                 this the startup Genome Project how many                                 people hands okay that's great lots of                                 new so there's these guys and they                                 started doing like real scientific                                 research or like real statistic research                                 in what makes the startup successful                                 there's so many startups tech startups                                 now popping up that it become it becomes                                 quite easy to do that actually and what                                 I've done                                 a set up a questionnaire looking at how                                 much funding your company had what kind                                 of growth phases you went through what                                 kind of founders you have and basically                                 they they make a mobile and they then                                 try to group these different types of                                 startups in a statistical way and they                                 made a report and the report is                                 available online if you didn't put a URL                                 well if you look for a start-up genome                                 project you'll find it it's really                                 really really useful I learned a ton                                 from it like this thing what kind of                                 start up are you are you more technical                                 or more business see this slide is                                 slightly off today because of the news                                 um but I didn't foresee that um but if                                 you look at these two people like this                                 is he's an uber geek right Steve Jobs is                                 still fairly geeky but he's quite a bit                                 more business E and I took these people                                 because they're like probably some of                                 the biggest icons in tech world today                                 but what out what I want to show it that                                 is M look at yourself look at your                                 founder team like who are you are you                                 technical more slightly because you're                                 in drupalcon probably your technical or                                 are your business E do you have somebody                                 who's really like good at sales and all                                 that stuff because that will have a                                 significant impact on the type of                                 business that you'll be able to                                 successfully build you come just you                                 know not anybody can do any type of                                 company and that's like some of the most                                 interesting information that I got out                                 of this report I'll come to the types                                 now um so first of all like I'm going to                                 talk about four types of startups and                                 slightly dissect them and what what kind                                 of makes them special and what like what                                 kind of team is able to do them so first                                 the optimizer this is good for people                                 like us                                 it's a highly technical basically you                                 take something that that's hard to do                                 that's technically hard to do like I'll                                 give a couple of examples soup after                                 this slide and you you build up you                                 build a website that will automatically                                 do that that's the that's the ultimate                                 type of business and what's interesting                                 there is that you don't need salespeople                                 for this kind of tool their self selling                                 you put them online you have to get to                                 some some little bit of virality within                                 the ends they'll carry themselves you                                 don't have to talk with customers you                                 don't have to go and visit customers and                                 all that stuff it's not necessary and                                 that's the kind of thing if you're very                                 technical you probably want to do one of                                 these these are a couple of examples                                 there are some really big names here but                                 if you look at them if you analyze them                                 they're actually optimizes because like                                 like SlideShare the publishing of                                 presentations that used to be pretty                                 hard before SlideShare like doing that                                 in a nice way so they optimize that                                 that's the kind of business stats that                                 that's one of the key businesses that we                                 are good at as a community next one is                                 the social transformer these are getting                                 more interesting these are things that                                 work through network effects probably                                 you need a little bit of business act                                 like insights but you probably way the                                 technical team you can still get pretty                                 far with this kind of this kind of webs                                 and this kind of web startup like the                                 idea here is that this is not like                                 Dropbox you signed last slide because                                 Dropbox worked from day one you didn't                                 have to have X amount of people already                                 on the platform to make it interesting                                 so this type of startups needs achsah                                 mount of people to make it interesting                                 before they can start and and these are                                 really really interesting type of                                 startups because they're they're the                                 highest impact they will change the                                 world and I think well                                 might be your goal to you know change                                 the world or make an awesome product get                                 back to the in a second some examples                                 you know these right these are very                                 visible everybody knows them and their                                 their big examples for a lot of a lot of                                 people I want to build startups next                                 type that's they identified in the in                                 the startup genome project is the                                 integrator and this is also interesting                                 these are companies that take a                                 technology like Facebook and they builds                                 a platform for small business for it so                                 they they are like but since they're                                 working for small business they need                                 sales people they need internal sales                                 people people that are not too expensive                                 so you don't have to go fly them around                                 the world they sit in your office and                                 there are talking with customers and                                 like making SMEs feel comfortable where                                 it's buying your product so that's but                                 the caveat is that for this kind of                                 business you need business people right                                 because you need sales it's not as                                 hardcore as you know people going door                                 to door or you know going into companies                                 but it's already a bit harder so for                                 technical people if you have a pure                                 technical team probably not such a good                                 idea these are a couple of examples                                 they're less visible probably you know                                 one or two but like if you see like                                 dimdim that's been both by sales force I                                 think actually sales for should be on                                 this slide also it's also going after                                 small and medium-sized businesses they                                 also have internal sales for as they                                 also have internal sales so people that                                 will answer the phone and call you up                                 like when you when you place an order or                                 you log in they call you up yeah they do                                 so am yeah there's a couple of examples                                 of that and a fourth type that's the                                 Challenger these are interesting                                 companies like because what they do is                                 they take a technology and they                                 like running all the way they go after                                 the enterprise they're like a crea right                                 they they will take technology and beef                                 up their sales force and then go and                                 sell it to those people that normally                                 wouldn't buy it until somebody actually                                 goes and talks with them and convinces                                 them for this type of business you                                 really need somebody who does business                                 you really need a business founder                                 somebody who's done it before who knows                                 how to build up a sales force because if                                 you don't if you don't build up a sales                                 force you're not going to win this                                 you're not going to get far with this                                 these are businesses sets that are like                                 that like son mysql like there were yeah                                 big time oracle does there's a very                                 clear fit it might like Salesforce well                                 there they've got both branches i think                                 they got they also go after SMEs but i                                 guess i guess they also go after big                                 business so those were the four types                                 now one thing that i didn't really talk                                 about is what's your goal what are you                                 in for what do you really want to reach                                 with building a company do you want to                                 earn a lot of money do you want to build                                 an awesome product or do you want to                                 change the world you know who kworld                                 altar and and it's really important to                                 think about this because like you as an                                 as a founder like I myself I felt this                                 before that you can easily get the call                                 in the you know the daily business of                                 running your business and you know                                 getting enough money in and and you know                                 growing the business getting more                                 customers running projects that you you                                 easily can forget about what are you                                 really doing this for and if you forget                                 you're probably gone you're not going to                                 be all that happy or you're not going to                                 be as happy as you could be are you not                                 going to get where you want to be if                                 you're in for this for changing the                                 world you're going to be a you                                 running different types of this of                                 businesses you're going to be probably                                 you're not going to be running an                                 integrator right because integrators                                 they're cool but it's been done before                                 and targeting SMEs probably it's a good                                 business but you know it's not going to                                 change the world right so that's I'm                                 going to change gear now so so far I've                                 been talking about lean startups and                                 kind of the basic concepts for that is                                 everything clear so far everybody's                                 still here nobody went dozing outs it's                                 hangover day today drupalcon so the next                                 thing I want to talk about this is a bit                                 about the future like where are we going                                 now what what are they up possibilities                                 how do I see all this why is this room                                 full right because if you're well it's                                 almost full maybe there's some people                                 upstairs still but why why are so many                                 people looking to make products in                                 Drupal and and well probably it's                                 because you're thinking similar things                                 as me which is probably something like                                 this probably you're not thinking this                                 though who has heard before of the                                 Cambrian explosion yeah few people for                                 the other people and cambrian explosion                                 is a concept that came up as a theory                                 that was developed by geologists because                                 what they were looking at the fossil                                 records again by you know biology is                                 seeping in back we're going back to my                                 roots and what they found this is this                                 picture is just random right this is not                                 the Cambrian layer is just showing nice                                 layers and it was a creative comments                                 that's why I took it but um but what                                 what it shows is layered stuff and if                                 you know a little bit about geology I                                 think every everybody knows that now                                 from National Geographic and stuff                                 then you know that there's there's                                 fossils in these in these regions but                                 what I found was that there was this one                                 layer the Cambrian layer where before                                 there was like very little diversity and                                 an offered a layer it just suddenly                                 boomed like there were so many different                                 business models building models so many                                 different types of organisms that                                 suddenly were created and so and it's                                 interesting to think about why did that                                 happen how come that's suddenly from                                 fairly boring ecosystems you get to this                                 whole diversity complex kind of thing                                 and that is basically because of                                 evolutionary triggers what are                                 evolutionary triggers they figured out                                 while one of the theory that the main                                 teri right now is that at the Cambrian                                 age there were so much oxygen in the                                 atmosphere that suddenly there was                                 enough food there was enough resources                                 to start doing really different things I                                 think today we're in a similar period                                 for for the human race oh no we're                                 talking really big but if you look at                                 what's going on today there's so many                                 changes that have happened there's so                                 many Liberation's like today you can                                 build a start up on a shoestring budget                                 and build it into a million-dollar                                 business it's possible a lot of people                                 are doing it today a lot of people fail                                 obviously but but it's because of these                                 three things it's open source because                                 there's a lot of software that you get                                 out of the box that does a lot of stuff                                 already just out of the box it's cloud                                 computing because you don't need to buy                                 a whole server park and plan for                                 becoming a really big or going down                                 miserably when you hit it big and you                                 can just scale you your business runs                                 well great no problem just you know add                                 a couple of instances and you you're                                 fine there's nothing big deal about that                                 anymore and mobile mobile is going to                                 change everything why it's already                                 changing everything I think most people                                 here have smartphones                                 like imagine going back                                                  telling people that you will have this                                 thing in your pocket that's actually                                 like a computer and it's connected to                                 the internet and you can like at the                                 touch of a button you can find anything                                 it's just insane it's like it's                                 redefining business so much everything                                 not just IT everything it's touching                                 everything and these three things                                 together mean that these tools this                                 technology is is now available to                                 anybody anybody can go and build a                                 start-up it's not expensive it's not                                 hard you just need an idea and and some                                 you know persistence to go after it and                                 I believe there's this giant big value                                 explosion that's going on right now a                                 value like after leveling the playing                                 field you know the playing field of all                                 the I can do it Drupal shops that we                                 could go and grab and and yeah I think                                 that's in this new Cambrian IT explosion                                 I think there's there's going to be a                                 lot of new business models that will be                                 built and probably the business model                                 canvas will be one of the tools that's a                                 lot of people will be using this lean                                 methodology customer development those                                 are all the tools that will help you to                                 be one of them to be one of those                                 conclusion these are five things that if                                 you're serious about building your own                                 product you should go and do maybe not                                 today maybe not tonight but in the next                                 week at least it's like read about this                                 mental models they are really help you                                 to to gather new understandings and                                 insights get the business model canvas                                 go and fill it out if you got a product                                 idea you need to do that three read the                                 startup genome project report it's                                 awesome there's there's a lot of work                                 with it's still but there's a lot of                                 knowledge in there that that will help                                 you better understand what you're doing                                 for me at least it did figure out what                                 kind of company you want to be do you                                 want to be                                 the world or earning a lot of cash or                                 you know do you want to be sailing in a                                 huge shot by the time you're a pensioner                                 or are you rather going to take a risk                                 and you know builds build something that                                 will change the world and that you can                                 brag to your grandchildren imbalance                                 make a choice make it pick one there's                                 different options but but they have                                 different parts a five-start building                                 minimal Viable products MVPs today maybe                                 that's something you could do today now                                 again a change of tack one other thing                                 that I think is valuable is or that's an                                 interesting evolution I don't know yet                                 if it's going to run I don't know how it                                 will work but one of the things that in                                 our ecosystem could be like a good                                 platform to create a bunch of value like                                 a new marketplace is this whole app                                 store business thing now I know a lot of                                 people have very strong opinions about                                 that and I agree with them um but I                                 think if we do it right and if we do it                                 if we don't let other people do it like                                 free if we if we don't do it somebody                                 from outside our community will do it                                 and they'll run with it if we do it we                                 can do it in such a way that will                                 actually strengthen our community I will                                 create a new marketplace a new platform                                 on which a bunch of different business                                 models can be built and a lot of                                 different new businesses can be started                                 and my my understanding of that would be                                 that you would take the people that are                                 building distributions you take the                                 people that want to build applications                                 you take the hosting companies you put                                 them all together under one umbrella and                                 you help them make their own application                                 store app store maybe that could be a                                 cooperative you know in our goods almost                                 socialist ideas um it would be about                                 business it would be about my earning                                 money it wouldn't be for free but guess                                 we all have to live                                 and right we can do a lots of stuff for                                 free and do a lot of stuff for free but                                 at the end of the day I've got a family                                 to feed and you all have and you can't                                 you can't live from free free is great                                 and it helps you but it should not be                                 your only focus and then and probably                                 most of the bits that you produce should                                 be on drupal.org and I think if we do                                 this right it could be something that                                 can help grow our community and                                 diversify because if you look at Drupal                                 it's like this giant fractal your Drupal                                 not Drupal itself hence to some extent                                 actually but the Drupal community for                                 sure you know everybody knows what's a                                 fractal so like you started sweetie                                 small grows start branching gross start                                 branching like everywhere it keeps                                 branching and growing in a lot of                                 different niches that's really what we                                 have to help this is what we should do                                 as rupal shops as rupal business owners                                 as startups because if we if we all do                                 the same we're going to end up in a                                 zero-sum game we're all going to be                                 competing for the same resources and you                                 know have to fight with each other and                                 that's no fun let's diversify there's                                 plenty of plenty of new resources and                                 and a new opportunities out there that                                 we can go after and do in a more                                 collaborative way so bottom line is                                 don't be a bottom feeder this is a                                 fossil from a cockroach they've been                                 along for a very long time they're                                 probably going to be along for a very                                 long time but they're not all that sexy                                 and they're not ruling the planet at the                                 moment we are my change but but bottom                                 line is you should you should try to                                 diversify don't try to do what everybody                                 else is already doing because it's not                                 fun and it's probably a bad business and                                  with that there's more bar codes if you                                  want to follow me on twitter if you want                                  to hook up a linkedin ping me or come                                  first stock with me if you want to hook                                  up a linkedin then                                  can we can get connected and if you like                                  this presentation definitely go and                                  evaluate it if you didn't like it you                                  might consider but but that's something                                  that's the organ has asked I totally                                  changed this slide because it I use open                                  office and I didn't want it to grow kit                                  and but i think the QR code is more fun                                  so go and rate my session and one more                                  announcement i'm thinking about creating                                  a drupal product camp that probably be                                  in Europe probably in Ghent probably                                  this fall it's not sure yet there's                                  there's a groupon Drupal's groups of                                  drupal dork for products if you search                                  for i think if you search for my name                                  and products summits or something you're                                  probably finding or ping me and if                                  you're interested what what it would be                                  it would be probably an open space where                                  a bunch of people with similar that are                                  also building companies come together                                  and share experiences very agile and and                                  with that so i would like to thank you                                  for your attention                                  are there any questions I'll first go                                  with you I do yeah just say and i'll                                  repeat very interesting what the                                  question is what do you think about the                                  strategy of phase two I think well                                  they're doing it different so first of                                  all they've got multiple distributions                                  and I'm sure they're well I can't talk                                  for them I'm not face to but I'm sure                                  that there should be able to use to                                  leverage those distributions to do                                  something interesting probably could be                                  through something like an app store                                  potentially but but you should ask that                                  money but um but I think the thing that                                  there they have to like come up against                                  is the general negative feeling against                                  app stores and the whole idea from the                                  community so so if you're if you want to                                  build apps if you want to be in that                                  business or if you want to build                                  distributions come to the come to my                                  meetup because we're going to talk about                                  that there okay about amongst others and                                  I think first Mixel                                  so the question was if you show all the                                  companies like Oracle and stuff where                                  would you put I p.m. but IBM is a bit                                  older yeah so they focus on service                                  innovation but if you look at them I                                  think in the bottom line there there are                                  really going out selling and they're                                  really going I think they're going                                  pretty pretty much after enterprise I                                  think well that but there there's so                                  much beyond startup that probably did                                  they've diversified in so many                                  directions it's hard to say now but I                                  would say that probably there since                                  they're going more for the enterprise                                  market i would put them as a challenger                                  router back in the days for sure now in                                  certain fields definitely also yeah                                  integration and that kind of stuff yes                                  yes I think so yeah thanks so yeah okay                                  yeah so the question is like how are you                                  going to get funding if you don't know                                  where you're going well the first face                                  when you're doing your discovery you                                  don't need money like you can do this                                  really in your garage you you just do it                                  on your own money and and and that can                                  be very little it's like depending on                                  where you live obviously it is going to                                  be less or more if you live in a cheaper                                  area you can you can go pretty pretty                                  long while on a little money and you                                  could be doing a lot of prototypes like                                  that and then the moments that you come                                  into validation like I didn't show to                                  the different stages so you gots                                  discovery validation kind of clean up                                  and then scaling those are like the four                                  phases that every startup should go                                  through if you look at the discovery you                                  don't really need money for dance so so                                  what what you want to do is come to a                                  point where you're ready for validation                                  at least or you're already validating                                  before you go and get money because then                                  you have like a market fit probably you                                  know even going to investors could be                                  part of your minimal Viable Product that                                  could be part of your strategy seeing if                                  anybody wants to invest in the ideas if                                  they don't want to invest probably yeah                                  you're not going to make it work so you                                  have to go and make a pivot so yeah I'm                                  sure sure even even in discovery face                                  you need to eat but like so what can you                                  do um first of all like what we are                                  doing and several others are doing is                                  build a service business and you know                                  built that up and run your products in                                  parallel that's one to get a job first                                  and save some cash live a bit nimble and                                  then stay living nimble until you have                                  your minimal Viable Product sorted out                                  you really need very little money like                                  that if you live with your parents it's                                  really cheap                                  I wouldn't recommend that though but but                                  I'm you know that there's this like                                  you're you're a business person you're                                  an entrepreneur well there's a                                  difference between business and                                  entrepreneur you're an entrepreneur                                  entrepreneurial spirits like the more                                  things that are against you the better                                  you work the more innovative you'll be                                  if if money is like really biting you I                                  like you're almost out of cash you'll                                  get really creative so so and it might                                  even be good to have like a clear runway                                  okay I'm going to run out of cash by                                  that month we have to move fast like                                  tomorrow I put out a Minimum Viable                                  products and I'll get information now so                                  it really helps you reshape your                                  thinking because there's this really                                  interesting things there's been these                                  there's these I shall meet ups around                                  the world it's just a few in London also                                  um and what they see they're like you                                  should go and read Steve blanks blog                                  they're running like what they see they                                  run a class and like sometimes they have                                  this I shall start up meetups we're like                                  teams come together and in like two days                                  they're going to build a product two                                  days right and I see that some people                                  they're really good at this stay in like                                  half day they got a minimal Viable
