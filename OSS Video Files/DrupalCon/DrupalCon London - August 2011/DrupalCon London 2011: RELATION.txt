	                              alright so we are my name is closed                               Eden's mad latarian Twitter and do and                               my name is dick Olson I'm ethicals on                               Twitter and on Dickson on score on dro                               and the developer at Al Jazeera down in                               Qatar originally coming from Sweden and                               node one so that's where I'm from I am                               CH acts in real-life Twitter and                               drupal.org we are going to talk about                                relation module a relation relationships                                were a thorn in my side since                                          we tried to run a reverse bound epi for                                a module implementing a generic                                relationship API a but it didn't go                                anywhere until last year when at the                                tropical San Francisco been found and                                myself had a most fruitful dinner when                                we have figured out how could we build                                symmetric relations and everything else                                just follow it from that that was pretty                                much the history and I am going to let                                the other guys speak because something                                marvelous happened as well this is a                                contra project that actually has a lot                                of contributors usually country project                                are one-man mission this excellent                                gentlemen are maintained errs and we                                have more we have like five or six                                people actively contributing to relation                                all right I see even more people have                                showed up so I'm just going to say once                                again that there's overflow space out in                                the hall with screens and speakers so if                                you get tired of standing you can go out                                in the hall hope there's a seat left                                there                                yeah the screens and audio so the                                relation module if you want to be really                                harsh you could say that what we're                                going to present today is absolutely                                nothing new at all but hopefully you'll                                have you'll find some use for it as well                                but there are there's a a traditional                                solution which many of you probably know                                about as the reference module it                                consists of two sub modules you can                                relate things two nodes or users and the                                fundamental problem that is solved by                                this traditional solution is that they                                need to link from one object to another                                and while this has served very well and                                it's a good solution for that specific                                problem it's not quite enough for what                                we want to accomplish so first of all                                you can't relate to any other entities                                than those two that are hard-coded into                                the modules users and nodes and if you                                want to relate to comments to products                                from the commerce projects or two                                taxonomy to a term or any other entity                                that's custom-made for some purpose then                                you would have to copy the entire module                                and rewrite it to to suit that purpose                                also it's strictly directional and                                binary so you can only relate from one                                thing to another even though you can                                have multiple field values it's still                                always from A to B and never you can                                never go back and you can ever have a                                symmetric relationship between several                                different entities the limited the                                search module storage model is also                                somewhat limited we'll talk a bit more                                about that later and you also it's all                                so complicated to add additional                                information to the relationship if you                                want to emulate something like Facebook                                friends or something then you would need                                to have                                an extra text field on for example the                                user to describe the type of                                relationship and all the matter that I                                would have to go on either of the either                                source of the target which doesn't                                really make sense and would clutter the                                interface                                so on the first problem the solution is                                that we have a more generalized                                framework so that you can relate to any                                entity at all so all of the previously                                mentioned comments and commerce products                                and all that and if you write a custom                                entity for any reason that's worked                                without any problems as well just fine                                and for the second problem we're since                                you attach a field to the source you                                would have to have a similar field on                                the target if you wanted to relate                                backwards as well and the solution to                                 this that we have is that we add an                                 intermediate entity the relation module                                 defines an entity called relation and                                 then you relate everything to this                                 relation entity instead of directly                                 relating the entities to each other                                 we have for the storage module the                                 storage module that's used by the                                 references system becomes fairly limited                                 again because it's a field so it's                                 difficult to expand that you could in                                 theory do everything with the reference                                 module that we can do with the relation                                 module but since we approach the problem                                 from two very different viewpoints the                                 solution looks very different so we have                                 a completely different way of storing                                 this data which is consistent no matter                                 how the relation looks and it's so you                                 can see it's also very performance so                                 the first example is the way that many                                 of you probably have done this before                                 you have no day and you link to node B                                 this could be for example and an article                                 node linking to a some sort of fact box                                 it could be a blurb for an article                                 linking to the article and this goes as                                 the arrow shows just one way                                 now if you have a binary relation the                                 relationship is going to look like this                                 instead you have the relation entity at                                 the top and then this relates in turn to                                 both the two both know day and node B                                 and then afterwards you can set if you                                 want this to be a directional                                 relationship or if you want it to be                                 symmetric an example of a symmetric                                 relationship would be a group of                                 siblings where there is no relationship                                 between say three siblings isn't going                                 in any particular direction they just                                 have this relationship and they are all                                 equals within it and this like we                                 mentioned before this the storage model                                 for this is consistent so that if you                                 want to link up more for example if you                                 have three siblings or seven or even                                 more of a completely different kind of                                 object you can just link as many of them                                 as you want into this relation and then                                 we have if you if you look at this one                                 we have if we say that you have four                                 nodes that you want to link together you                                 need one relationship object and the new                                 link all of them to it if you would do a                                 symmetric relation with the normal node                                 reference that would look something like                                 this and there is no less than                                           involved in connecting all of these if                                 all of them are going to be symmetric so                                 that it becomes a mess if you want to                                 extend it beyond what it is currently                                 doing                                 yeah basically it basically doesn't work                                 it becomes a complete mess so what's                                 really good about this storage model                                 then and we have no change in the API to                                 support all these different storage                                 models binary Henry how many want                                 directional bi-directional whatever you                                 want so no change in the API it's very                                 consistent API no change in the storage                                 as I just mentioned and we can also have                                 a very consistent UI for for dealing                                 with all these different sorts of                                 relations we'll talk a little bit more                                 about the UI gonna have a demo here                                 later and the fourth problem that                                 latarian mentioned here is that the old                                 way of doing references you can have any                                 additional information on the relation                                 itself and the solution for this is                                 obviously now the relation is an entity                                 so now we can have whatever fields we                                 want on the relation itself you                                 mentioned a very very good use case                                 about facebook friends you can have the                                 type of relationship friend family etc                                 another example could be you have user                                 entity you have a party entity and then                                 you have a donation referal a shin in                                 between them a field on that relation                                 could be amount that you donate for                                 instance it becomes a really nice and                                 consistent way of doing doing things and                                 some additional niceties that just                                 happened basically this was not the                                 intention to solve but that comes very                                 natural with the whole thing is that                                 integrates very well with d                                      couldn't say or do this in d                                             plays very nice with the entity model of                                 doing things so that's a good thing you                                 also have integration with contrib we                                 have views integration                                 and we also have a good basic rules                                 integration are going to show you it's                                 very very API driven at this point and                                 which is the intention with this module                                 for very heavy custom stuff but there's                                 some new I to that we're going to show                                 also an another problem that i'm                                 personally dealing with since i'm                                 maintaining the depot module is that it                                 makes content staging much easier                                 content staging is something that                                 breathes mentioned in his keynote that                                 something they're going to be emphasized                                 in Drupal                                                              does you make the content station much                                 easier I think about the scenario if you                                 have the old reference model where you                                 have two nodes and sometimes you want                                 them to reference to each other there                                 are many cases you might want that and                                 what that creates basically is a                                 circular dependency because what we have                                 to do when we stage content is that we                                 first move all the dependencies so all                                 the references needs to be deployed                                 first before the main node can be                                 deployed okay so here we have a very                                 circle of dependency you can't move any                                 of the nodes exposing an IP I could be                                 tricky etc here we have one relation                                 entity in the middle you can deploy all                                 the notes and then just deploy the                                 relation entity after that so it's makes                                 content staging much easier and also it                                 performs very well the views performers                                 chicks can talk a little bit about that                                 so if this is just a more or less a                                 footnote but some of the things of the                                 stories rather it looks fairly scary the                                 curry views generates for this but we                                 have actually timed it and despite the                                 car it looks pretty scary it's actually                                 a                                 not a performance killer there's a they                                 only cost the difference between using                                 references and relation that you need to                                 deal with one more join but it doesn't                                 change the how to say the type of the                                 query you are dealing with a if you only                                 join to have a information on both end                                 point it's gonna be equally performant                                 if you are filtering on both end points                                 than it again going to be equally                                 performant which of course we stick with                                 me that it is not going to perform at                                 all because that's the fundamental                                 problem right that if you join things                                 together then you can filter both then                                 you cannot really index those yeah i                                 think the this was all that i wanted to                                 mention about a huge performance we have                                 nice views and rules demo yes i'm gonna                                 do that here just need to arrange the                                 mic a little bit                                 yeah I am very fast I hope you got all                                 of that now I just need to to clone the                                 screen instead of doing the presentation                                 mode                                 sorry                                 don't be mad                                 ok                                 feels like I'm gonna have some play                                 piano something okay so what I'm going                                 to demonstrate here is three different                                 things first I'm going to show the                                 interface of how to create different                                 relation types basically how you create                                 the different bundles similar to how you                                 create different content types of nodes                                 so that's the first thing I'm going to                                 demonstrate here so on the structure we                                 have relation types okay right now we                                 have three different types of relations                                 here we have donation and a few tests                                 relation types here we can start by                                 adding a new relation type here let's                                 say we call that an ouch okay                                 ton of the L blame are you see you                                 somewhere                                 would where do you have the scroll                                 there you go                                 is that better a little bit                                 they go                                 okay so adding a new relation type here                                 first we just want a label of the                                 relation type let us say that we want to                                 create a transaction it could be a bank                                 transaction or could be anything with a                                 machine name automatically automatically                                 created here we can make it directional                                 if you want to and we have a reverse                                 label here too so we could say this                                 could be transaction to bank and if it's                                 directional that's transaction from user                                 princess                                 we have a few different options here                                 maybe you want to describe in detail                                 chicks very very quick here No okay okay                                 okay here you can hear you can choose                                 the artery of the relation we got to                                 keep it simple for now but here we also                                 have the source bundles what work                                 basically what bundles it can be the                                 source bundle and what bundles that will                                 be the target bundles okay so in the                                 transaction here I would probably want                                 user for instance                                 two                                 I donated                                 yeah I'm just going to do a generic                                 demonstration and then we're going to                                 show the donation relation so just just                                 to demonstrate here we actually don't                                 have a no type for for instance Bank                                 here that's right so what you could do                                 actually here because if you go down to                                 the bundles you can see a very                                 interesting thing that the relation                                 types are also listed as possible it is                                 to relate to you can create such things                                 you because relation is an entity in                                 itself you can actually relate to that                                 to a relation which actually here is a                                 good used case because if you have a                                 user which donates to a party then that                                 donation can be linked to a bank saying                                 that this was a bank transaction and                                 that's best described by actually                                 relating to the donation entity itself                                 so this is another nice T of relation                                 that you can exploit very nicely that                                 relation is just an entity as any other                                 okay so just to step back a little bit                                 here i'm just going to demonstrate how                                 the donation relation is set up here                                 label as i covered its directional for                                 this one and the source bundle the                                 donation is coming from you sir and we                                 for simplicity just choose all note                                 bundles probably when I choose the party                                 bundle here actually I don't kind of                                 change that at this point and so that's                                 the very basic settings you have to set                                 up so you need to figure out like what                                 kinds of relations you have on a site                                 usually you just have fields for this                                 but here you need to think a little bit                                 more what kinds or what types of                                 relations you have okay and to                                 demonstrate the                                 to demonstrate the views integration                                 here i'm going to show how we set up a                                 few things first so here we have a party                                 node and we don't have a view here yet                                 it's that stack on the view                                 ok                                 okay it's under donations okay so here                                 we have a very basic demonstration of                                 the views integration we have admin has                                 donated twice to two parties the                                 drupalcon party and another group of all                                 do book a drupal party as you see here                                 and you see here the interesting thing                                 here we have amount so the donation here                                 the relation self has amount and to see                                 how that works go here relation types                                 and for the donation relation type here                                 we can manage fields and it's you see                                 here now we have a field on this one                                 okay and it's just a basic text field                                 integral field at this point works as                                 any other integer field so you're                                 probably very familiar with this one                                 here something's here                                 so that's the view we can we can go in                                 and look at the settings here                                 so that's one thing you need to take in                                 mind here when you create views with                                 these kind of relations to it you need                                 to add depends on your use case                                 obviously but here we have two                                 relationships added to this view one                                 from as we see here from the user to the                                 node itself and then from the user user                                 to the relation so we have the fields to                                 like these so we can show the amount for                                 the donation so this one is very new I                                 only commented the user to relation a                                 few days ago and this one is probably                                 going to change in the future we are                                 working together with the views maintain                                 errs on figuring this one out because                                 it's a tricky problem to solve actually                                 because sometimes you just want to go                                 from the user who donates to the party                                 who have donated to on the other hand                                 other times you want to stop on the                                 relation entity meanwhile so you                                 actually want to add user to a relation                                 and their relation to party but but the                                 problem is going to be the defeat they                                 do the latter then everybody will be                                 forced to always the two relationships                                 that's how what in API works it's not                                 the end of the world after all I am just                                 a little bit reluctant to force                                 everybody to always use to relationships                                 so this is where still in a little bit                                 of a flux                                 okay so that's basically it for the                                 views relation integration here and most                                 of you here are probably very familiar                                 with the views interface and how you                                 play around with the different                                 relationship so I'm not going to cover                                 that in detail but that's essentially                                 what you need to do pull out to be able                                 to extract the field information that's                                 out and such from from a relation so we                                 were working on that as chips mention                                 another thing i'm going to demonstrate                                 here is the rules integration i'm going                                 to show you how to set that up and we go                                 into consideration okay there you go                                 we had workflow rules here                                 and so this is a little bit of a tricky                                 one so I'm assuming here now that you're                                 familiar somewhat with how rules works                                 and I'm not kind of going very detail on                                 everything but so I hope you follow me                                 here and and unfortunately I don't have                                 a practical use case we are gonna                                 demonstrate how to set up the                                 configuration and such because that can                                 be a little bit tricky and so we have a                                 a rule here you said donated something                                 I'm gonna edit that and use case here is                                 now content is being viewed we're                                 treating on that so as soon as someone                                 looks at the party that user                                 automatically donate something which is                                 pretty neat thing isn't it yeah we could                                 set up conditions here only party note                                 you probably want to do that they are                                 even donating even if they are looking                                 on pages here even better so the set up                                 here it's a little bit tricky and here                                 we have some debug code we don't need to                                 check on that and actually delete that                                 one                                 okay anyway so first thing we need to do                                 is that we need to create our array of                                 endpoints okay so i'm talking a little                                 bit in PHP or programming lingo hair but                                 but it will make sense here so first                                 thing we need to do is to add a variable                                 and basically you have an action can                                 show you how to add that add action and                                 it's basically the first thing you have                                 here Adam add a let me see                                 yeah at a valuable thing and the type of                                 variable should be list of where do you                                 have yeah their list of entity items so                                 that's the kind of variable you want to                                 add first to create the array basically                                 you can edit this one here so this is                                 how it looks the array at this point is                                 empty okay and the next step is to add                                 an item to this array so the first thing                                 we do here is that we add the current                                 user to that array so the use of that is                                 logged in right now is first added to                                 that array of what will be the end                                 points of this relation the next thing                                 you want to do is to add another item to                                 your list of endpoints okay and in this                                 case it's the note that we are viewing                                 and at this point you have two entities                                 in your endpoint array you could add                                 different even more notes here you could                                 add you can take in notes from different                                 relations you can you can play around                                 here pretty much with the whole routes                                 API and I'm assuming that you're                                 somewhat familiar with it at this point                                 so what we got now is that we have an                                 array of endpoints basically                                            I'm going to sleep all right let's keep                                 our debug here and then we have an                                 action created called create a new                                 entity and and this action here is                                 provided by the entity API module and so                                 we're adding creating a generic entity                                 which happens to be a relation at this                                 point relation type donated to and it                                 also picks up our field API field here                                 that we have for endpoints which is the                                 list of entities that we have here                                 so what this configuration now does is                                 that it will save this relation with the                                 provided endpoints that we have here the                                 use case i'm demonstrating here is my                                 not something that you do on a                                 production site or anything but that's                                 the basic how you're approaching the                                 rules configuration with it and it's                                 it's pretty it's exactly the same if if                                 you would do it in code array of                                 entities you pass that into the same                                 variable we have a questions question in                                 the back and I think we can take that no                                 so so to repeat the question is that and                                 do I have to add the source of the of                                 the relation as the first item in the                                 array or endpoint array yes that's true                                 that needs to be the first when it's                                 directional of course cuz then that's                                 when it only makes sense okay so that's                                 true so that's the basic rules                                 integration class is going to                                 demonstrate the relation block that we                                 have to create relations in a different                                 way so this is one way you can do                                 programmatically and close is now going                                 to demonstrate another way of creating                                 relations okay yeah                                 chicks can answer that so I'm not                                 surprised that that question because we                                 this is probably the most popular issue                                 in our researcher a first the question                                 is wrong yes so sorry I didn't repeat                                 the question which was can you add the                                 relation from the note that it form the                                 answer is that yeah this is being                                 working on but this is more often than                                 not it's the wrong way to think about                                 things because relations are not part of                                 the endpoint they are separate entity a                                 and so if you are creating it from the                                 endpoint entity creation screen then                                 that's probably the wrong approach I                                 know that this is a as I say very                                 popular so this is being working on a                                 there's actually called that I could say                                 works somewhat it's not tested yet I                                 mean it doesn't have automated testing                                 it works enough but there are several                                 technological challenges in this and                                 namely the interval seven the entity API                                 well that was just not enough time to do                                 everything and for example there's not                                 really a way to provide a generic                                 autocomplete a there is just no way                                 because because the the way the entity                                 API works there is absolutely no                                 guarantee that the label of the entity                                 is going to be a column in any database                                 so you cannot really find an entity                                 based on a label in case for example                                 relations the relation entities do                                 have any label defined for example a                                 user model for user what we do is we                                 basically step outside of the entity API                                 because usual module already provides a                                 user router complain but the user entity                                 is label if you look into the user                                 entity definition is created by same                                 username so you cannot really have a                                 generic way there's just no generic API                                 for death and basically yeah it just                                 wasn't this is this is not done so we                                 are going to provide an autocomplete it                                 is going to work for some entities it's                                 just not going to work for every entity                                 because that's impossible to do it is                                 going to cover about eighty percent of                                 the cases and of course there is also                                 the problem where you want to create an                                 entity with several endpoints we came up                                 with a very different UI which solves                                 all these problems which I'm going to                                 let a class to demonstrate that one                                 maybe I will say a few words before he                                 demonstrate so basically what we do here                                 is that we realize that the entities                                 that you want to relate to you probably                                 have some way of finding them already we                                 do not care how but we presume that your                                 site has a navigation or does the admin                                 knows how to get there and we are                                 reusing this class is going to show how                                 alright so we have on the left side here                                 a block called the entity collector and                                 if we look at the list here we will see                                 verbal party and rubicon party which was                                 just mentioned we we have them here I                                 have navigated to in this case just the                                 front page which lists these two                                 entities so I could now pick I'll have                                 to do this in the reverse order actually                                 if we're going to create a new relation                                 will go to user                                                       have here user admin and i will add that                                 to donate it to i add user first because                                 this is a directional relation so user                                 will be the source pic and then i have                                 in my picked entities list here user                                 admin now if i go back to the front page                                 I still sort of carry around this picked                                 object this entity from before i can add                                 say the drupal come party                                 Oh                                 now I have these two here and then I                                 could if I wanted going to add further I                                 could add as many n points as I wanted                                 and then I click create relation and                                 then I get a new relation so                                 oh nice                                 I want I wonder if that's our rule                                 situation or if it's a other rules bag                                 will have to look at that so here we are                                 viewing the actual relation                                 you have the notes field which we can                                 add value to                                 Jane                                 as you have seen on the relation entity                                 edit screen you bring that back please                                 the Edit screen you cannot actually edit                                 the relation itself this is something                                 that we debate heavily right now how do                                 we continue with that but traditionally                                 there's not really any point in editing                                 an entity anything a relation because if                                 you need to edit it that is actually                                 going to be a different relation at most                                 what you want is delete the old one for                                 example a if two people are married they                                 divorce and remarry that's definitely                                 not going to be the same entity right                                 Oh                                 oh yeah that does one can the fields can                                 be edited the unpause cannot be edited                                 the fields up shortly can be that's                                 that's a very valid point yes the dot                                 that's that's a different thing it's the                                 end points that you cannot tell it yeah                                 yes that's one of the problems that does                                 that mistakes are hard to correct if you                                 don't hello editing but allowing other                                 thing is gets really really tricky to be                                 honest because due to the problem with                                 the entity selection it's a ton trivial                                 basically a what we could do you I wise                                 probably maybe a two things one that we                                 after all are going to have a field edit                                 widget on the left side on the node                                 screen right where you can create a                                 relation after all so there we might                                 want to allow editing the other one that                                 we could do is that you pick an entity                                 go to the scree go go to the relation                                 entity view screen and there you can say                                 replace this one with the one that you                                 have pegged the other thing that I was                                 considering is to create relation types                                 to add another flag to the relation type                                 which is editable the relation type                                 itself would be editable or not because                                 I believe that it's good to actually                                 look down so most of the cases you don't                                 really want to edit                                 okay before we can take any more                                 questions how can I just want to mention                                 some some quick things here so chicks                                 are all recovered here some bits of it                                 we're looking into creating a widget for                                 it for doing relations we have even more                                 view support coming so that's almost                                 done another project we want to look                                 into is also replacing and kissing core                                 we have all sorts of different types of                                 relations and everything is implemented                                 in its own way everything works                                 differently so have a very consistent                                 relation model in court would be                                 something that we probably want to have                                 so we are probably going to look into                                 that another thing that we've been                                 thinking of is also entity hierarchy                                 module imagine having hierarchies as                                 entities and you can provide more                                 information to that entity too well                                 sorry but in here the entity hierarchy                                 the problem is that in core for example                                 you have a taxonomist where the taxonomy                                 terms have their own way to provide a                                 hierarchy between entities you have                                 comments doing it a different way you                                 have books doing it a third way so there                                 is no doubt that it would be great to                                 come up with a consistent way to handle                                 hierarchies but that's a different                                 problem space and because religion                                 creates entities if somebody comes up                                 with an entity hierarchy module which                                 I'm not saying that it's not gonna be us                                 then relation is going to slot into that                                 run really nicely but that's not the                                 data problem that relation wants or                                 needs to solve it's a really really hard                                 to solve the issue on the other hand                                 relation was also something that seemed                                 impossible for a very long time until we                                 came up with this a weird idea of adding                                 an intermediary entity so it is possible                                 that we will be able to come up with                                 something but I can tell you that entity                                 hierarchy                                 in general is extremely hard and and if                                 you go with the textbook ways it's not                                 really doable with the databases that                                 will work with and it's literally the                                 textbook bottom floor Bochco has a                                 chapter on storing trees in a sequel in                                 his book but neither of these are going                                 to work with my sequel the guy works for                                 oracle so you can guess what those                                 solutions work with but there are no                                 other solutions really so questions                                 about relation not hierarchy questions                                 i'm not taking hierarchy questions you                                 were the first                                 they did arrive there's you I the                                 storage could handle it yeah so the                                 question was a why you cannot edit                                 relations it's cy and this concept there                                 is nothing in the storage water that                                 would stop it the endpoint are just a                                 field on the relation entity so if a                                 field API perfectly supports updating                                 field and so that's absolutely possible                                 I'm just I'm just reluctant to do it but                                 i guess that people are going to come                                 with me because they have after a                                 convince me to provide a widget on the                                 note that the screen to create a                                 relation which Ivers absolutely I'm                                 willing to do for a long time                                 ok so what god said is that please take                                 the sherry it's extremely important for                                 future door Mekons whether if we were if                                 it really sucked here they shouldn't let                                 us ruin another topic on so please take                                 the survey                                 you you can already do this with rules                                 by the way okay                                 don't even ask we so the question was                                 what about permissions this is an                                 extremely good Nora issue because a that                                 another thing that entities do not                                 really solve at this moment yeah and                                 it's just insanely hard you know you you                                 have a relation with even just two end                                 points what what is the module supposed                                 to do if you cannot if you do not have                                 access to one of the endpoint is this                                 going to immediately deny access to the                                 relation I would suspect that that's not                                 what people want because it is possible                                 for example that a you could subscribe                                 you could log in and then suddenly the                                 other endpoint would become wizard balls                                 so people probably want to be able to                                 reach the relation entity screen and say                                 you need to do this or that to be able                                 to reach the other end point so that                                 probably shouldn't deny access to the                                 relation on the other hand for other use                                 cases it is definitely possible that if                                 one of the endpoints are access denied                                 and you do need to deny access to the                                 relation so that's one problem too aside                                 from concept there is absolutely no                                 entity access system there's no                                 consistent entity access system at all                                 which would make this and they were very                                 hard dominant I dummy and especially is                                 planning to fix some of this on friday                                 at the code sprint because this can be                                 viewed as a security issue against                                 Drupal                                                              consistent entity access way so the                                 question is very real and what can I say                                 not much okay                                 so so you only have one array of                                 endpoints yeah repeat the question you                                 want asked if it was required to have to                                 erase is that correct why not to erase                                 well we only have one the thing is that                                 we want symmetry it should be symmetric                                 the relation should be symmetric so we                                 only have one erase of endpoints so                                 that's the fundamental problem they were                                 trying saga day with the module to be                                 the relationship should be symmetric and                                 if you if you had a different we want to                                 avoid having a different way of creating                                 directional relationships we want it to                                 be as consistent as possible so you                                 that's why we only want one array and                                 then in the special case of a                                 directional one the first element is the                                 source                                 okay yes so the question was do we plan                                 to do anything where you have a graph                                 the answer is a very definite yes                                 comment Albans has a graph API module                                 which has relations integration already                                 awesome so you can actually draw those                                 graphs already and there is an open                                 issue to provide an API for this so the                                 question is most definitely yes half of                                 it is already works so it's a yes very                                 very much yes you Hannigan no this one                                 is using as I said endpoints our fields                                 so whatever field storage engine you                                 want to use a beat MongoDB elasticsearch                                 PBS I don't care I don't care I'm                                 storing endpoints as fields exactly for                                 the reason you have mentioned so that we                                 can use any database that you want with                                 this                                 no more questions okay                                 so rdf exposure there's an open issue                                 for that as well Apaches are welcome i                                 am not going to do it if somebody else                                 is doing it you are most welcome oh okay                                 it seems that we ran out of time so                                 thanks for attending please fire in the                                 survey
