Building multilingual websites is hard. It's hard because there are many different decisions that need to be made, touching everything from business logic to technical considerations.

Every multilingual website is different: different countries, different languages, different organizational structures, different redaction workflows and cultural considerations on top of that. Drupal has the tools to address all of these issues, but being faced with the seemingly endless combinations of parameters can be discouraging.

In this session, we'll look at five cases of multilingual websites, starting from the general assumptions and going down to module selection and configuration details.

Intended audience
Site builders wanting to get a better grasp of multilingual solutions for Drupal.

Questions answered by this session
