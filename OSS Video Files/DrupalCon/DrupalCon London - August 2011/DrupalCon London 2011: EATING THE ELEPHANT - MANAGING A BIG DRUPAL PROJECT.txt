Al Croston
So what's it like to manage a huge Drupal project with over 100 people on the team, a multi million pound project budget, and demanding clients?

Colin Sweetman and Al Croston of Axis12 Limited will talk about the lessons they've learned about building and structuring big Drupal teams, scaling Agile and keeping Stakeholders happy.

This isn't deeply technical, but is aimed at explaining how you can scale a Drupal project, use virtual teams, work with agility and still meet customer expectations when they come from a waterfall world.

Our session is confirmed for 1:30pm on Thursday 25th August. We can talk for days about our experiences in this area, but given the limited time slot we have available for the session, the key areas we plan to cover are:

- How do I scale a Drupal team for an enterprise project?
- How can I keep agility and provide a waterfall wrapper for the client?
- Hiring: how to find the superstars
- Building team cohesion
- Selling Drupal to nervous clients

We'd really like to know what questions you'd like us to answer so we can tailor the session to provide the most benefit to you.

So email us via our contact page at http://www.axistwelve.com/contact with "Drupalcon session" in the subject with your questions. We will do our best to cover everyone's requests within the limited time available to us.

that's a                                metaphor there are no elephants in this                                presentation no elephants were harmed in                                the making of this presentation and just                                quick introduction my name is Colleen                                sweetman and this is our croston from                                excess                                                               presentation so those of you that are                                here because you want to find out about                                bill technical building a big group of                                sites this is not the presentation for                                you this is about the project management                                and stakeholder management for big                                drupal projects so just so we've got                                that clear upfront so if you think this                                isn't for you that's absolutely fine                                quite understand but I just wanted to be                                clear about that up front okay what will                                cover the approach is this is a kind of                                a map this is not a specific case study                                it's an amalgamation of lessons that                                we've learned on big durable projects                                we're not here to teach you stuff we're                                just trying to share some of our                                experiences and some of the lessons that                                we've learned and just so that you can                                maybe take away some of the things we've                                learned it might be useful for you and                                everybody's projects and everybody's                                organization is different you need to                                adapt and it's not there's no                                one-size-fits-all approach but so we're                                just sharing some of our experiences so                                what we'll cover is scaling a triple                                team for an enterprise project keeping                                agility but providing a waterfall                                wrapper for the customer and we're going                                to that it gotta be a detail finding and                                keeping superstars a building team                                cohesion so once you've built your team                                trying to help that team                                it's kind of top performance and                                something that we got some feedback from                                a few months ago we put up a blog post                                on our site and said that we're doing                                this session let us know if there's                                anything specifically want us to cover                                and one of the things that we got some                                feedback about is how do you sell Drupal                                too nervous client so it's not exactly                                within the mainstream of this                                presentation but people did ask for it                                so we'll just share how we approach it                                okay so I'll just watch over to out it's                                going to set and see Thank You Cole so                                this is a pretty dry topic so what we're                                going to try and do to put it into some                                context is set the scene as Cole said                                we've got a series of projects that                                we've amalgamated together to try and                                make this presentation work so picture                                this your quietly sitting at your desk                                you're in a senior role in a team you                                might be on your fourth coffee for the                                morning and your boss comes up and touch                                you on the shoulder and says mate I want                                you to do me a favor and I want you to                                take on this piece of work it's really                                going to be great quite a bit of work                                but it's going to be really something                                very special in the end so what he                                starts with is I'd like you to set up a                                team and you're thinking ok so far so                                good and they're going to be all                                contractors you start to think okay this                                is getting a little bit worrying but on                                the stress levels it's all okay you then                                start to hear a bit more he then says I                                want you to develop a new website it's                                going to support a huge community of                                users hundred thousand they're all going                                to be active and it's going to have a                                whack of content lots of content you                                start to think okay this is getting                                better you then hear the good news that                                 you need to audit migrate                                                items from existing sites they're not                                 Drupal sites in any way shape or form                                 some of them are                                                      them are really really complicated stuff                                 you're starting to think now okay how                                 can I get out of this you then start to                                 think all right they can't get much                                 worse you then hear that you've got nine                                 months to do it you do start to hear                                 some good news in that you do have a                                 budget that is pretty flexible you'll be                                 able to get the people you need to do                                 the job and you will have some pretty                                 good control over it but when you start                                 to do the planning the                                 about the mass think about how many days                                 are in a month he's very quickly                                 realized you're going to need a big team                                                                                                       with some huge supplies to back you up                                 you also start to think that to try and                                 use the most of time Offshore's going to                                 do some favors so the challenge has been                                 set you're already thinking my god on my                                 stress is it going through the roof how                                 am I really going to get out of this                                 what we did let's tackle this one step                                 at a time or as the metaphor goes one                                 bite at a time so I slid it under goal                                 and the project yeah so Alice got his                                 stress levels up through the roof so the                                 first thing you'll do is come and share                                 that with me as this project manager and                                 the first thing I have to do is start                                 thinking about the project fundamentals                                 and you know any of you their own                                 projects the fundamentals are the                                 fundamentals which is the the old                                 classic project triangle of the scope                                 the time scales and the quality and                                 obviously you've got that budgetary                                 constraint within it and even though                                 it's almost a cliche and it's a gross                                 civil litigation for a pms perspective                                 it's really really interesting and very                                 important to just go back to those basic                                 fundamentals to think about what that's                                 going to mean about how you're going to                                 get the balance right because you've got                                 to get the balance right of an                                 acceptable level of quality not gold                                 plated necessarily but it's clearly got                                 be an acceptable level of quality try                                 not to build up too much technical debt                                 because of the speed at which are doing                                 stuff and also get it out on time                                 because we've got a set launch day and                                 so I'm not sure about time ok we're                                 going to try not to pass the baton all                                 the time so on to what we think is                                 easily the most important factor a very                                 big project is the people we've been                                 lucky enough to work with some pretty                                 amazing people I can see a few of them                                 you so I had to say that really know but                                 they have they really have been                                 incredible we've been really lucky to be                                 able to use some incredible connections                                 within the community to get the best                                 people and as I'll say it again easily                                 the most important aspect it doesn't                                 really matter what you've got to do if                                 you've got the people who helped you                                 there's a really good chance you'll get                                 there what we've also tried to do is                                 always hire the best and we've been                                 fortunate in that our budgets have been                                 pretty good we've been able to recruit                                 heavily get some great people but when                                 you were trying to build a team from                                 scratch the size of a hundred people you                                 really got to think carefully about how                                 you build that up our approach has been                                 in the past to start with a senior                                 people get some senior people who have                                 got some pretty good ideas about how to                                 deliver get those guys in on the ground                                 and get them involved in doing that                                 recruitment they want to choose the                                 people that they want to work with they                                 want to be comfortable with them they                                 want to be confident in them you want to                                 get the best that they can out of                                 everybody what we've always done in the                                 past is spend the time on recruitment or                                 there's a tea under that hand what that                                 really means in in general day-to-day                                 work is you do spend a lot of time on                                 recruitment I think we spent probably                                 the first few weeks if not months in                                 interviews I think on average we saw                                    CVS or resumes for each individual                                 candidate that actually made it into the                                 team which is a pretty incredible map                                 but you do get quick at looking at                                 people and looking for their expertise                                 and of course there's an experience that                                 they can put on paper but you really                                 need to be able to work with them so we                                 would often get them in and have a bit                                 of a chat about things not a traditional                                 interview in that sense it was a bit of                                 a discussion about how they thought                                 these sorts of projects could be run                                 what they're interested in generally how                                 they see themselves working in the                                 future what they want to get into what                                 we also try to do is give our technical                                 people code tests and we're really                                 specific about the things that they                                 needed to meet and it was surprising the                                 people that particularly devs who could                                 really talk the talk but when they got                                 down to doing that real specific                                 activity of code testing now really                                 struggled or vice versa some not                                 surprising couldn't talk but we're                                 amazing at what they could do in terms                                 of cutting co what we also try to do in                                 that sort of sense of building everybody                                 up was to make sure that everybody knew                                 what their deliverable was we made sure                                 that from the team down everybody knew                                 what they were responsible for and the                                 areas they weren't you don't want a                                 high-performing team standing on each                                 other's toes it gets really complicated                                 to manage and everybody gets pretty                                 upset                                 so it was very clear what people were                                 responsible for and what they weren't                                 okay that the key part of what we're                                 trying to deliver relied on a team not a                                 group of individuals a team we spent a                                 lot of time working on team cohesion                                 making sure that they were happy working                                 together again making sure that                                 everybody knew what they're responsible                                 for and weren't getting worried because                                 they'd miss something everybody knew                                 what their deliverables were everybody                                 knew what they were expected to do and                                 when they're expected to do it they                                 worked hard at that what we also tried                                 to encourage was a bit of work hard play                                 hard we had a monthly happy hour                                 shopping ended in a few late nights but                                 was great because you got to know people                                 outside of a work context it wasn't                                 quite mandatory but it was pretty close                                 we've got a lot of people who enjoyed                                 coming along some people it just wasn't                                 there cup of tea which is fine we just                                 found that having a chance to sit down                                 with people was really enjoyable to get                                 to know people outside of that work                                 sense I think the key part of having                                 such a high powerful high power team                                 sorry is that you empower them to                                 deliver we encouraged our senior leads                                 to resolve those issues within their own                                 teams or at that senior level and not                                 look for a steer every time something                                 came up and they became very good at it                                 excellent at it actually they were able                                 to resolve any of those big issues that                                 came up just by having a chat they'd had                                 that great set of experience so they                                 could do that face on that experience                                 and they were not worried about trying                                 to do it some of the brainstorming                                 sessions that happened after midnight on                                 a Tuesday Wednesday night were really                                 incredible lots of great things came                                 from that what we tried to do was make                                 sure that everybody knew who the                                 management structure was we wanted to                                 sort of make sure that everybody knew                                 who they could go and talk to make sure                                 that everybody knew that there was a                                 structure in place in the end it got                                 quite flat in a way we had a group of                                 people who would meet regularly with the                                 senior management team got to voice                                 their concerns ask questions about how                                 things were going or not and got to                                 really see how to control what was going                                 on knew where we're aiming and got to                                 put their two cents in about how we get                                 there                                 as we said right at the start we we had                                 a big internal team but we also needed a                                 lot of internal sorry external supply                                 help and we engage some companies in                                 India to do that work for us as I said                                 that gave us a great almost                                         delivery we got to use the time                                 difference and they were able to help us                                 in terms of that delivery what we did do                                 is make sure their communication lines                                 with them were excellent we always made                                 sure they understood what we're trying                                 to achieve and when we're trying to do                                 it we also made sure that they                                 understood what context were working in                                 they came and visited the office we had                                 here in the UK they came in sat with the                                 team they rotated in and around made                                 sure they understood who they were                                 talking to they had a face to the name                                 when they are in a Skype session or                                 having a chat over the phone the thing                                 you've got to do though with those                                 companies is make it clear what sort of                                 input you want from them you set the                                 standards early you make sure they                                 understand what a successful delivery                                 means what you expect in terms of                                 timeliness and quality I don't think                                 there was any doubt that our standards                                 were quite high but our suppliers really                                 rose to the challenge and were able to                                 deliver for us and I think we have                                 benefited from what was some pretty                                 crazy time scales and getting the work                                 done they were able to improve their                                 processes at the same time we're                                 improving else okay so you've got the                                 delivery team right everything seems to                                 be going pretty well in terms of the                                 team itself but don't forget the                                 stakeholders you've really got to show                                 those stakeholders in love the first                                 thing we needed to do was convince our                                 stakeholders that Drupal was the CMS and                                 many of you that have gone through it                                 will know that it is quite a complicated                                 thing to do stakeholders often come from                                 historical background of IT projects                                 being really horrific very bad                                 experiences of budgets being blown                                 before anything really comes on board so                                 what we try to do is picture along the                                 lines of Drupal being one of a handful                                 of new back then open source products                                 and we compared those to the what was                                 available then those cots are                                 commercially off-the-shelf products and                                 said that really what you've got to                                 think about is how strong these open                                 source products are already and how                                 strong they're going to be in the market                                 a lot of the the                                 I guess the reasons we gave them                                 everybody here will know you wouldn't be                                 here if you didn't believe in them                                 yourself in terms of Drupal we really                                 focused on the stability it had been                                 around for a long time several versions                                 in and a huge amount of features                                 thousands of thousands of features it's                                 a bit hard for stakeholders to get that                                 in context so we spent some time showing                                 them individual features and talking to                                 them about what that would mean in terms                                 of how you get delivery done quikr calls                                 going to talk to you a bit about agile                                 in a minute but agile and drupal go very                                 neatly together in terms of the                                 stakeholders mind they can see how                                 module stick together they can see how                                 they fit in a sprint at that stage what                                 we also started talking about was who                                 else was using Drupal there's some                                 really obvious ones White House in the                                 States data.gov here is a relatively                                 recent one they really started to get                                 their head around that if those sorts of                                 calibers of companies and organizations                                 and governments are using Drupal it must                                 be safe we we also started to think                                 about what else was being done within                                 the UK and lots of other companies                                 within the UK we're also starting to                                 pick up Drupal government generally had                                 started to look at it capgemini                                 obviously got a big stand here they've                                 really helped the presence within the UK                                 of using Drupal stakeholders generally                                 are now getting their head around what                                 it means to be able to use such a                                 powerful tool then interestingly I                                 thought this might have been a bit of a                                 nervous point for them but the community                                 aspect was a real selling point having                                 tens of thousands of active users who                                 are really active in promoting the                                 product help get their head around what                                 a big community helps Drupal drives it                                 on makes it happen                                 okay so we told them triples to go we                                 sold them Drupal they finally brought up                                 to it then we spend a lot of time making                                 sure they trusted us and we thought that                                 was important so they would let us get                                 on with things we tried to build that                                 trust by showing them we wanted them to                                 see how things were progressing and you                                 get that different level of interest                                 some stakeholders want to see things                                 some don't really care some want to know                                 how many problems there are some want to                                 know how much the budget has been used                                 how much you've got to go in terms of                                 time scale what we focused on was                                 showing them progress and we would do it                                 all the time and to anybody who is                                 interested anybody who asked we would                                 show them some people were uninterested                                 in the design piece some people wanted                                 to see how many servers are in Iraq                                 literally we would show them whatever we                                 could and as often as we could what we                                 also tried to do was make sure that we                                 had a great strong reporting structure                                 over the top of our delivery & Co we'll                                 talk a bit about this again we made sure                                 that there were traditional reports that                                 were available to the stakeholders we                                 made sure that they had the things that                                 they are used to seeing risk reports for                                 example red amber green where are the                                 problem areas what are we worried about                                 what do we think we're doing in terms of                                 progress we're up in this area bit down                                 in that why is that and I think we ended                                 up reporting on a weekly basis in some                                 detail which is a bit of an overhead but                                 we got really a good response from our                                 stakeholders and they were able to trust                                 us to get on with it you hear some                                 horror stories about stakeholders being                                 so hands-on and really grinding a                                 project to a halt because they can't get                                 their head around what's being delivered                                 and don't really trust what's going on                                 we got in some ways quite fortunate that                                 our stakeholders were able to let us get                                 on with it okay yes so we talked a                                 little bit about the project                                 fundamentals few slides back and ours                                 just be talking about the people both                                 internally within the project team and                                 also on the stake other side of things                                 so now we're going to cover some of the                                 slightly less glamorous but very                                 important                                 processes around running the project                                 like that this isn't good of a project                                 management seminar it's just an overview                                 and it's just those lessons that we                                 learn so the classic the classic                                 comparison you're always going to have                                 about how it going to deliver any kind                                 of technology project is agile versus                                 waterfall I would think that most people                                 here would say that waterfall is great                                 for building things like bridges where                                 you know what type of bridge it's going                                 to be helping a gap you've got to get                                 across what material is you're going to                                 use how much weight does it have to                                 carry you know everything up front                                 wonderful spine for that it's really                                 good but it's not so good for technology                                 projects a particularly web projects                                 where the business requirements emerge                                 over time as you're working on the                                 project and an agile is great for that                                 kind of stuff technology projects                                 however big projects the projects are                                 the size that we're talking about by the                                 very nature because there's so much                                 money involved in there so high profile                                 will always be funded and governed in a                                 kind of water or very structured world                                 so the challenge that we've got in the                                 business is how can we deliver our                                 projects as agile projects but put that                                 kind of water for wrapper around them so                                 what I call is kind of tactical agile so                                 they go on a day to day week by week                                 internal team approach we try and do it                                 in an agile way but particularly the                                 PM's role is to try and apply a                                 waterfall wrapper around it which which                                 goes out to the governance model and the                                 stakeholders so that they it's related                                 to that trust and confidence thing the                                 more trust and confidence that you can                                 build in them the more freedom they will                                 give you and you know that you need a                                 lot of freedom as a project team to go                                 to run agile really well because you                                 have to be able to flex and adjust and                                 adapt and inspect and adapt so I just                                 got a quick word on evangelism because I                                 know the project management                                 methodologies and it can get people you                                 get quite emotional about it so so can I                                 just ask anybody here who's prince                                  practitioner or its previously qualified                                 yeah so as a few hands up there any                                 certified scrum profession                                 roars out there yet few more hands out                                 there so it's all good stuff but my                                 personal opinion my advice to you is if                                 you're a p.m. or if you're if you're you                                 have to deliver a project in you you're                                 thinking about methodologies just use                                 what works try and do agile within the                                 team prince                                                       government support outside the team                                 don't get hung up on methodologies guys                                 in this room that may be one or two                                 exceptions but we're not actually paid                                 to evangelize agile or scrum or Kanban                                 we're paid to deliver great websites and                                 methodologies are just tools in our                                 toolbox and just use the tools that work                                 and adjust them and adapt them it                                 doesn't matter if what you're doing is                                 slightly different to the way Quinn                                 schreiber tells you you should do scroll                                 it doesn't matter because clenched Weibo                                 is not the guys going to get fired if                                 your project doesn't get delivered so                                 just use what works the job at a PN in a                                 situation like this in my view is very                                 different from a traditional p.m. role                                 which is much more about controlling                                 monitoring kind of being on top of                                 things all the time in my view it's more                                 about support for the team and support                                 for the stakeholders so that's in terms                                 of providing that visibility the reports                                 the really good quality business                                 intelligence about that other projects                                 is going so that they feel completely in                                 control so that you also have got                                 information to the right people as far                                 in advance as possible so they can make                                 the right decisions about steering the                                 project around so that's where you get                                 into things like managing your risk                                 portfolio really trying to look ahead of                                 time about what roadblocks are coming up                                 and also on a more day-to-day basis                                 within the team my view is certainly on                                 these projects my role was very much                                 lesser a big in an almost kind of like a                                 like an agony auntie almost in some                                 respects my job was to help the team                                 right down to individual levels help                                 them get their blockers out the way just                                 look around and slightly kind of adjust                                 and nudge things back on track not step                                 in with great big boots                                 stop people doing things the aim was to                                 give the teams of the individuals within                                 the teams as much freedom as possible                                 for them to do what they're good at as I                                 said earlier on we put a lot of effort                                 into picking superstars if you've got                                 really good people you have to trust                                 them and you have to give them as much                                 freedom as possible to really shine so                                 so within the team we ended up working                                 mainly using                                                         five days sprints up to                                                 and for us that that project                                         Sprint's work best and a kind of a kind                                 of typical kind of scrum thing but it                                 was actually in some areas it start to                                 evolve into can bang we're doing some                                 can band stuff which is kind of a slight                                 flavor on the kind of standard sprint                                 model where you you measure how much                                 capacity to go into the sprint and that                                 was driven by team members themselves                                 they came back to me and said actually                                 you know we'd be thinking about this and                                 some of us have been away we got away                                 and done some reading with us and                                 studying about Kanban and we think what                                 we're doing but if we do can't that sell                                 so I said yeah sure okay let's try it                                 you know classic agile inspect and adapt                                 hearing weird cross-functional scrum                                 teams so you'd have your bas your devs                                 your testers you'd also have developed                                 support you'd have architects solution                                 architects technical architects                                 designers UX guys all working together                                 in some cases they were less embedded                                 than others obviously people like bas                                 and devs and testers were really closely                                 coupled in their cross functional teams                                 are very deeply embedded in those                                 cross-functional teams whereas maybe the                                 devops guys the sysadmin Zanda systems                                 engineers would just have a fairly light                                 touch across those cross-functional                                 teams outside the team I my                                 responsibility as the PM is to make sure                                 that outside the team the people that                                 needed that the decision makers the                                 blokes and ladies with the checkbooks                                 had their highlight reports the                                 traditional kind of highlight reports                                 they got a good risk management and                                 great visibility of risks that are                                 coming up so that they could make                                 this is decisions well in advance which                                 obviously helped us as a team about how                                 we mitigate those risks I'd obviously                                 change control so which is a bit tricky                                 where you're trying to deliver a job                                 because you know changes built-in that's                                 all we're doing is agile but we're                                 changed start to get really big or                                 potentially really big about changes to                                 what was required in the backlog we                                 would have a mechanism so that we could                                 stop the stakeholders from going totally                                 crazy and saying actually you know we                                 know we wanted a portal site but now                                 we've decided we want to do an auction                                 site you know something that big or                                 really big changes to the components of                                 the site we would have kind of threshold                                 so that it would have to go into more                                 formal change control so that that way                                 we mitigated a lot of kind of feature                                 massive scope creep but all of that                                 water for Lee rapper might part of my                                 job is to shield that from the team as                                 much as possible too because they need                                 to be able to work in an agile way not                                 get hung up in all that kind of stuff                                 and I will talk about some of the tools                                 and communications tools and stuff like                                 that that we used to try and help that                                 happen so I didn't have to go around                                 micro managing people and asking                                 individuals and and senior debs and and                                 some of the leadership guys on the                                 delivery teams for status reports they                                 naturally did their burn down charts we                                 knew what a bug backlog was all that                                 stuff has been delivered anyway just as                                 part of their day to day thing and that                                 day to day work and I could just I could                                 just look at those reports and                                 consolidate them without bothering                                 people so they could carry on cutting                                 code and delivering great functionality                                 so we had a product backlog and on a big                                 big project like this well the way we                                 worked as we slice it up into what we                                 could components and then within a                                 component increments so component will                                 be a massive thing like search but                                 within within a big component like                                 search you might have an increment which                                 is deliver one particular part faceting                                 we'd only work down to the detail level                                 as stuff got closer in the backlog in                                 terms of time there's no point over                                 doing loads of really detailed user                                 stories for things you're not going to                                 be delivering for six months because                                 there's a good chance that the business                                 requirement would have changed and all                                 that work would have been wasted anyway                                 could you love to do it again so the                                 stuff that was the highest priority                                 stuff was the stuff that we defined in                                 the most detail so that it was defined                                 and actually we got pretty good at it at                                 defining it and getting the user stories                                 and all of the acceptance criteria                                 nailed just before it went into it was                                 ready to go into the fall spring and                                 that worked really quite well broken                                 down obviously product owners normally                                 you typically have a product center for                                 an agile project something they speak                                 it's absolutely impossible to have a                                 single product owner because no                                 individual could get their head around                                 the scope of it and and have the level                                 of engagement that you'd need also                                 because of the thoughtful way that the                                 stakeholders wanted to work with us they                                 didn't want to get involved on a                                 day-to-day basis in the way that you                                 really need a product sounded to get                                 involved so what we did was we agreed                                 within that some of our senior                                 management team from within the project                                 team will be specialized area products                                 owners so there will be a technical                                 product owner there will be user                                 experience products owner there will be                                 a Content product owner for example of                                 those big broad areas and there is very                                 senior guys within the project team and                                 we got a formal mandate a sign-off from                                 the stakeholders that they had the                                 ability to make the kind of more                                 day-to-day changes that you want from a                                 product owner so that the product unless                                 you get involved with a cross-functional                                 teams the dads could come and say or                                 could come and talk to a product owner                                 and say look you know you said you                                 wanted this pink well it's going to take                                 us three days longer to do it pink are                                 you happy if it's red and now you had                                 the those area product owners had the                                 power to be able to say you go that's                                 fine just do it that way the really big                                 changes if we thought that's going to be                                 really tricky it's a big change then we                                 push it up it will go outside the team                                 in the formal reporting that we talked                                 about earlier on and then again that's                                 something that the stakeholders would                                 make the big decisions on but all the                                 more minor ones the ones that can really                                 slow a project down                                 we got the sign off to be able to make                                 those changes because we had really                                 experienced I perform in senior                                 management people in the project team                                 and the stakeholders I don't have trust                                 to get let us get on with it so building                                 the trust up in the psychology is really                                 really important if you want to deliver                                 a big budget quickly and they acted as I                                 said they acted as proxies for the                                 stakeholders so they were the guys they                                 were in our team so it was great where                                 fantastic comms we could talk to them                                 all day long in doubt day in day out you                                 know a UX guy to talk to them about                                 something the user testing guys that we                                 had to talk to know about things I front                                 and debs could say you know you said you                                 wanted this kind of JavaScript thing to                                 look like this well you know it's kind                                 of going to be a bit tricky can be doing                                 like that and they can just make a                                 decision on the spot so it's great okay                                 so as well as the kind of project                                 management processes we also had a big                                 range of standards that we had to think                                 about up front to put in place across a                                 whole range of things which are wrapped                                 around the projects and wrapped around                                 making sure that the quality of the                                 finished product is good enough so                                 things like accessibility standards                                 other non functional requirements like                                 security performance load coatings                                 triple coding standards all those kind                                 of things we have to make sure think                                 upfront about having those of                                 well-documented or well available online                                 on our own team intranet which you built                                 use an open atrium of course and when                                 you've got a hundred people and you've                                 got you Deb start in almost every week                                 you have to make sure that that                                 information is easy to hand so they can                                 learn really quickly about what the                                 standards artwork to a whole bunch of                                 stuff we had to do about testing massive                                 amount of work we did on testing both                                 automated and manual testing we learned                                 a lot of lessons about the amount of                                 work there is is setting up continuous                                 integration environments for big                                 projects like this I'm not going to go                                 into technical details I'm non-technical                                 guy but                                 we learned some big lessons about that a                                 couple of people smiling because we've                                 ever be say that about a thousand times                                 usability user testing was a huge big                                 deal we've got a great mandate from                                 clients to be able to go out and do                                 loads of larger user testing if you can                                 get clients to let you do it it showed                                 them the value of it it plays a massive                                 dividends I'm sure most of you know that                                 anyway and user takes users user testing                                 we've spent a lot of time and usability                                 and user testing because you can be able                                 to great functional website but you may                                 miss their target because it doesn't                                 actually work the way your demographic                                 was it to work release management load                                 of stuff on that the way we did code                                 submission you know the branching and                                 like kind of stuff and in conflict                                 management we obviously want a big site                                 like this where you've got like very big                                 environments and a big kind of                                 infrastructure footprint the conflict                                 management side of things is really                                 quite important to make sure that work                                 well so we stop it for that and again                                 I'm going to go into detail about that                                 one either so that's bad it on the                                 processes and around the supporting                                 activity and the operational readiness                                 type stuff that we did around there and                                 I'll push the records                                                  counted coal only five walked out there                                 I won the bet we thought processes would                                 be really tough after lunch we don't                                 lose a few people we are need but open                                 up six couldn't have that ok so we've                                 talked a lot about the people the                                 stakeholders managing those                                 relationships with the suppliers cause                                 talked a lot about processes which are                                 crucial definitely boring but crucial                                 the other thing that we think is hugely                                 important is operations first thing I'll                                 going to talk to you about is                                 accommodation and this is really basic                                 stuff but on a big project with a                                 limited time it's really important where                                 you can open plan office we found that                                 in our open plan office it was a lot                                 easy for people to communicate you                                 didn't have to guess if somebody was in                                 their meeting room in their office to go                                 and have a talk to them you just looked                                 up and there they were you'd wonder over                                 and have a chat that it's a really                                 important piece to think about how often                                 people are going to be sitting at that                                 desk possibly on weekends possibly a                                 long time make it open plan make it                                 bright comfortable I don't think I'd                                 want to sit too long                                 in an uncomfortable position or in a                                 dark room the other thing we tried to do                                 and this had some positives and                                 negatives is seat teams together some of                                 our senior team wanted to try and mix                                 that up a bit so we might have the the                                 front end dev sitting with the designers                                 for example but we had some big teams                                 particularly around content for example                                 that needed to be sitting together so                                 that as editorial standards change they                                 could easily talk about it they knew                                 that everybody was on the same page and                                 applying the same things the same way we                                 also had a few interesting discussions                                 and move people around quite a bit                                 within management it's a real conundrum                                 I think you can find that if you're                                 within your team and you can hear what's                                 going on you can easily sort out any                                 issues and answer questions really                                 quickly on the flip side people are                                 often concerned about voicing their                                 ideas if the management are there so we                                 ended up with a mix we ended up letting                                 the senior lead or the team lead choose                                 whether they SAT there and it was                                 different for some people some people                                 for the development for example just one                                 of the devs to get on with it they knew                                 what they were doing they had a really                                 detailed spec in front of them that they                                 could work to wasn't as like there was                                 as many questions to answer or ask about                                 solutions architecture different story                                 needing to talk amongst themselves get a                                 steer from our senior technical lead                                 make sure that they were following the                                 plan what we also made sure and we were                                 pretty lucky in that we got to choose                                 what sort of accommodation we had we                                 were able to leave some space for                                 breakout areas and wherever we could we                                 stuck whiteboards on the wall we had                                 some white boards on wheels that just                                 literally moved around the office it's                                 amazing what happens when there's a                                 whiteboard there somebody will draw on                                 it get some ideas those ideas are easier                                 to convey particular for people and I'll                                 pick on Deb's again who are not great at                                 communicating drawing the picture makes                                 it a lot easier for people understand a                                 visual representation really helps what                                 as course that we also had a jar which                                 meant that there were some very                                 enthusiastic planning sessions lots of                                 yelling and carrying on which is great                                 and really helps camaraderie within a                                 team but not so good if you're trying to                                 sort out how you install module X selten                                 works with module why so we've got lots                                 of meeting rooms and encourage people to                                 use their                                 their space for those meeting rooms and                                 keep that sorry for those meetings to                                 keep their discussions going and not                                 worry about how loud or boisterous they                                 are okay communications and again                                 another crucial aspect I seem to be                                 saying that a lot but if you think about                                 what can happen with a high-performing                                 team if they go down the wrong path                                 because they didn't understand what was                                 told to them or what was said to them                                 they get very quickly down that wrong                                 path you want to make sure that they are                                 very clear communication about what's                                 going on what's expected if the plan                                 changes make sure everybody knows that                                 that plans change make sure that                                 everybody knows what's expected of them                                 and keep the communications informal but                                 also formal we had weekly meetings we                                 had some senior management meetings                                 where the senior managers were expected                                 to go out and pass the information back                                 on they did that in an informal way a                                 lot of people prefer just a coffee with                                 their guys have a chat we had daily                                 stand-ups and daily scrum of scrums                                 really short sessions but it was                                 mandatory to attend and it made sure                                 that everybody was on the same page if                                 there was a problem that team I hadn't                                 sorted out a block of                                                   obvious that that needed to happen                                 really quickly big blockers got tackled                                 really quickly talked a bit about                                 meetings already we I think we struggled                                 a bit with meetings actually in the end                                 we had a lot of meetings we had a lot of                                 different discussions going on that sort                                 of turned into weekly meetings we tried                                 to make sure that everybody knew what                                 was going on it off and felt like a                                 one-way conversation people were really                                 taking that away so what we ended up                                 with was some short meetings and a few                                 of them probably several a week but we                                 made sure they were sure and important                                 if they weren't valuable it was a waste                                 of time therefore money what we really                                 tried to do with that punching each                                 other up was to be open and honest if                                 there was some discussion about ideas                                 and whether that idea was good or not it                                 was encouraged that you'd be quite open                                 about whether you thought that was a                                 good idea or not and if not why not and                                 often if not what's your idea and                                 replacement come up with some                                 suggestions keep the communication open                                 I can't remember too many punch-ups it                                 might've been one or two but we got                                 things going and it really                                 prove communication you knew that you                                 were going to get an honest answer to                                 any suggestion you had you knew that                                  you're going to have a good conversation                                  about ideas and they really helped form                                  solutions in a really quick way so use                                  communication systems we've got IM and                                  Twitter and the phone if I can style an                                  email we use lots of them Kyle talked                                  about intranet site we've also used                                  jabber IM we had skype lots of phone                                  calls particularly important when you're                                  using working with offshore teams to                                  keep that communication open we also use                                  things like team beer for people to see                                  and share each other's screens just                                  again visual so you can see what's going                                  on instead of listening to what that                                  person's told you and as we said just                                  keep the information going keep sharing                                  make sure everybody knows make sure it's                                  there for everybody we didn't have                                  secure areas on the internet that people                                  couldn't get to everything was open                                  everybody could see what other teams                                  were up to everybody was able to go and                                  talk to anybody if they wanted to know                                  more about what they were doing but what                                  it boils down to it's all about the                                  water cooler if you're there you want to                                  know something catch the person in the                                  kitchen have a chat to them just                                  generally discussion general discussion                                  turn up to their desk have a chat about                                  what you're worried about I've heard                                  about or any of those issues you'll                                  quickly resolve any problems okay IT                                  operations so i t-took it again obvious                                  but to a technical team it's crucial we                                  made sure that we had the kit for the                                  role and by that i mean we had designers                                  that had two monitors in the first                                  machine we had devs that had two                                  monitors we didn't ever expect a dev to                                  try and cut code on a little laptop they                                  wanted to okay but we tried to encourage                                  them to use the best that we could the                                  other crucial point is to make support                                  as easy as possible you'll quickly burn                                  money and effort if the support piece                                  for managing all of that kit and it's a                                  lot of kid for a hundred people takes                                  five six people to manage we made sure                                  that the images that were set up with                                  easily reusable that we made sure we're                                  on top of patches we made sure that we                                  used everything we could in terms of the                                  latest infrastructure                                  and we controlled it I think this is a                                  really important piece in something as                                  big as what we're talking about here was                                  an unusual to have                                                   boxes in terms of the site                                  infrastructure all sorts of environments                                  across those individual boxes having to                                  ask somebody to change something in                                  there is going to grind things to a                                  whole so it was key to us to control it                                  we didn't really get on very well with                                  the overall IT team but we eventually                                  showed them that our way was the way and                                  got to control what we were using and                                  made sure that change has happened when                                  without required and made sure that we                                  were able to speed things up another                                  obvious one connections to the team and                                  from the team must be as quick as                                  possible nothing breaks a coded spirit                                  than having to watch the hourglass tick                                  over they really really hate it again                                  another obvious one current versions of                                  software should be used there's a reason                                  they're there we've got to make the most                                  of them and again open source we found                                  in the end that I think we even went                                  away from outlook that's the only                                  proprietary system so there are plenty                                  of open source products out there to do                                  all that you need we found that                                  everything that we wanted from an ass                                  off where product was available in open                                  source we found that most of the time                                  they were better okay so you've done all                                  the hard work all the works been done                                  all the developments been done all the                                  testing has been done you're now                                  starting to think about how to get this                                  thing live which is not as easy as it                                  sounds in a site like this what we                                  concentrated on along with that testing                                  in the developments operational                                  readiness which is not just a are we                                  ready with the servers it's is the M&C                                  team ready other sales tomb ready is the                                  help desk ready have we done everything                                  we need to around informing our users                                  other stakeholders signed off in the end                                  it was less about technology in the end                                  was more about is everybody comfortable                                  that the site is what they expect it to                                  do sure there were some things that we                                  needed to resolve but are they critical                                  to the launch we really pushed hard with                                  stakeholders to make sure that they were                                  happy and had done a formal signature on                                  a piece of paper sign off and we spend                                  it quite a bit of time with our hosting                                  provider we wanted to make sure that                                  they understood that having to scale up                                  the site really quickly because the user                                  base to jump through the roof was a good                                  problem be prepared for it make sure                                  that we've got the right kit in place                                  make sure that we are using the cloud                                  get ready for it was we told them it was                                  going to happen they were prepared they                                  worked hard to make sure they were ready                                  and available and then when we did                                  launch we tried to make it as easy as                                  possible we have learned that doing it                                  at                                                                       development and bug fixing is not the                                  best way to go we tried to give                                  ourselves a bit of time do it perhaps                                  early in the morning perhaps a beta                                  launch make it as easy as possible and                                  on a full night's sleep okay okay so                                  you're all be delighted to know that we                                  come to the end so quick recap so will                                  be covered we talked about the                                  fundamental of the project triangle we                                  had our talking about the human factors                                  as i call it of the internal team                                  getting the right people making

that confidence                                  and trust we talked about the processes                                  on delivery and support and we looked at                                  aspects of operations around                                  accommodation communications i teach all                                  care etc and then ours just outlined

questions                                  I think we've got a few minutes to take                                  some questions                                  hi maxim from objects well basically you                                  didn't talk about one thing we I think                                  it's really important for her about his                                  estimation plant a client arrives in                                  with a big project and says okay I have                                  this when it will be done how much it                                  costs once you said you cannot be                                  changed or very difficult Lee so what is                                  your the rocket science technique to                                  instead well it's some of these projects                                  like this but one one of the things you                                  do not find is she doing that kind of an                                  outline of the budget so what you can do                                  from that is you can make him you make a                                  kind of an educated guess at the kind of                                  percentages of different roles that                                  you're going to need you know you're                                  going to need X percent of the people on                                  your team we're going to be bas y %                                  they're going to be dead so senior dev                                  and you're going to need a certain                                  percentage of senior dev to leave those                                  and guide those teams from that and from                                  what you know is the the current market                                  cost of those people per day you can                                  start to estimate how big is the bucket                                  of capacity that you've got to filled up                                  to fill that budget and built in                                  contingent seeing from that bucket of                                  capacity you can start to estimate very                                  broadly not exactly is that's a story                                  point level but you can start to kind of                                  t-shirt size what you could do in terms                                  of the components that they've the                                  clients have asked for in the scope of                                  the project and basically that's the                                  first you start to get the first view of                                  a project backlog then because the                                  because you're starting to see the                                  prioritized backlog list you've done                                  some t-shirt sizing you know how many                                  people it's going to need to deliver                                  those things and basically your capacity                                  list your your bucket of capacity will                                  ever eventually down that will have the                                  equivalent of a red line somewhere down                                  that product backlog and that's what you                                  can do with the budget that's how you                                  can estimate how much of the scope can                                  be delivered and that's the first thing                                  you'd start to feed back to the clients                                  to say based on the budget you provided                                  and the estimates we've done on the                                  skill sets and numbers of people that we                                  need to do this project of this scale                                  this is how much of your desired                                  functionality you'll get                                  is this still the priority that you want                                  things delivered in because that red                                  line doesn't move unless you give us                                  more money and then we're saying what we                                  found is they would then just above that                                  red line start to shift things around                                  pull something from below the line which                                  currently wasn't being done and move it                                  up so that list got shifted around and                                  they could really focus on what they                                  wanted that do you think you something                                  in the blue t-shirt but you can say                                  triple T shipping there's a deal then                                  here I had two questions one you                                  mentioned that you've got roughly a                                  hundred people in your team or whatever                                  I was really kind of curious to figure                                  out what the breakdown are the different                                  roles and responsibilities of that team                                  was and I'm also kind of curious once                                  you actually built up a team of                                      people would you do with them at the end                                  it's a good question should i do them so                                  i think of the hundred people we had and                                  stir you see he'll not it what about                                     content people                                                        okay sorry not quite right and roughly                                  about the same size for that dep                                  obviously a little bit smaller but dev                                  in our world included front-end devs sis                                  adds a mixture of dev ops                                                a small solutions architecture to four                                  or five I think who steered the overall                                  technical direction of the project we                                  had a uxt which handled a user testing                                  visual design wireframing we had of                                  missing a be a team who ended up being a                                  sort of a mini scrum master if you like                                  but also doing the work on producing the                                  Detailers call talked about for the                                  product the backlog and test so we had                                  tests that also worked closely with the                                  development team so i think it was a                                  steve was right we end up with a big                                  content team we ended up with a content                                  team being the main so let's say                                         them                                                                broken down in that gap and roughly                                  about the sun in terms of the team                                  we we work together for quite a few                                  years and then in the end the team got                                  disbanded so the team some of these                                  people are here access                                              formed on the basis of some of those                                  people but the rest are out there and                                  I'm sure if they put their hand up                                  they'll be available to have a chat to                                  anybody who wants to try and recruit                                  them and that just there that something                                  onto their that's one of the reasons why                                  clearly when this team was formed we had                                  to go to contractors to end up to                                  freelancers because if you're putting a                                  big team like that permanency a massive                                  HR overheads in doing it and also it                                  takes a very long time to build up                                  adding the permanent stuff that fast so                                  there are cost implications obviously                                  you always pay more for contract stuff                                  but in terms of the speed at which you                                  can build a team up and minimizing the                                  the HR overhead is really the only way                                  to go on a project like that just to                                  follow up of those                                                        how many of them actually had                                  significant triple experience Dave I                                  think Muslim didn't                                  but for those that didn't hear Davion                                  let our technical effort was saying that                                  we we ended up using as much people or                                  resource as we could through the Drupal                                  community and then go into people that                                  had PHP experience to try and pick up                                  their skills and we found that work                                  quite well actually in the mail we got                                  good at trying to as Cole said tip the                                  standards to start give them some                                  training and Drupal and PHP Davis is                                  pretty quick and Drupal in the end any                                  more questions no down will you so you                                  mentioned you outsource a portion of                                  your development to India how did you                                  vote for the variable code quality from                                  individual developers and suppliers as a                                  whole in India and also the different                                  design ideologies that you have out                                  there compared to say the UK or the US                                  well that's broadly speaking the reason                                  that that worked ok because they weren't                                  we didn't just farm a whole chunk of                                  work out to India and then they go from                                  work in a kind of a kind of a vacuum in                                  information vacuum but that offshore                                  resource was integrated into our teams                                  so they would be working virtually with                                  the our UK Deb's every day and our                                  development manager would be speaking to                                  them running stand-ups with them and                                  with the UK devs every day so there                                  wasn't really that kind of separation                                  and because they were working very                                  closely on on a day-to-day basis there                                  was a level of visibility and a level of                                  kind of organizational and cultural                                  alignment with the rest of the team so                                  there wasn't really a significant risk                                  of that happening how we having said                                  that there was you know that there are                                  there are challenges in working with an                                  offshore team in terms of the                                  communications can be quite tricky at                                  times especially when you're working                                  using kind of your working virtually you                                  have to sometimes be very clear about                                  what you're communicating in the way                                  you're communicating it there's an                                  overhead in that but generally speaking                                  it actually worked quite well and                                  certainly it's I think it's a really                                  value by doing it and the quality of the                                  work that we got from the guys that we                                  had offshore was very very good shut up                                  there so sorry me                                  hi having moved from dotnet development                                  into open source I've found getting a                                  consistency of tool sets quite difficult                                  for big teams did you mandate a tool set                                  for the developers that you brought on                                  board and if so what was it yeah we did                                  mandate we had a an image that we came                                  pre-installed on a developer's machine                                  it was quite flexible in the end though                                  there were some specifics that they                                  needed to comply with the details of                                  which I'm probably not best placed to                                  you but there are a couple of guys here                                  that will be able to give you the                                  details of that after the session we                                  tried to make it clear that there were                                  some things like code submission that                                  had to go through subversion for example                                  there were some things you just had to                                  do we also tried to without being too                                  over-the-top about it monitor what                                  people were up to in terms of what they                                  were installing on their systems we                                  didn't want a virus for example coming                                  into the system to bring the whole lot                                  down it was important that people were                                  aware of that and in the main people                                  okay with that okay anymore where is the                                  torture over okay great I think we're                                  done thank you very much for
