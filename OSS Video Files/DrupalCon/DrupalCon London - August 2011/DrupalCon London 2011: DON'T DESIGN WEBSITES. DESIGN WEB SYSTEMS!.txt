Drupal's theme layer is very flexible and can accommodate just about any web design. It's important for designers to remember, however, that they're not really creating a page — they're building a complete system to house the all of the site's content. By creating the sitemaps, wireframes, and mockups, designers are actually outlining a site's feature set. Designers, not developers, determine a site's purpose and functionality.

In this session, we will talk about the importance of understanding a CMS during the initial design phase of a project, as well as how to create a Drupal-optimized design. Standard practices, tools, and Drupal-specific shortcuts will be discussed in detail.

All too often, however, projects begin the design phase prior to choosing a CMS. In these cases, it's important for the stakeholders to understand that their choice of CMS may alter their design. To demonstrate the steps necessary to complete a successful Drupal "conversion," we will present a detailed, real-world case study of the Expeditionary Learning relaunch. Four Kitchens co-founders Todd Nienkerk and Aaron Stanush and Thinkso design director Adam Snetman will describe how they translated a thorough but CMS-unspecific design into Drupalspeak — all while minimizing cost and meeting the client's high expectations.

Intended audience
This session is intended for anyone who has had to create or implement sitemaps, wireframes, and mockups. Those unfamiliar with Drupal will learn what Drupal "wants" to do and will be able to more easily prepare these materials, and those who already work with Drupal will learn tips and tools for managing the expectations of clients whose designs haven't been optimized for Drupal.

Questions answered by this session
What should a designer know about a project before architecting a site or creating its look and feel?

Why are sitemaps, wireframes, process flow diagrams, and mockups important, and what are they supposed to communicate?

What happens when you're given a design that wasn't created with Drupal in mind?

What are the challenges a design firm faces when they aren't the ones implementing their design?

What tools and techniques can be used to accelerate the design process in Drupal?

how many                               people here are beginners in Drupal                               theming and design awesome intermediate                               advanced okay that's actually a really                               good cross section that's exactly what                               we're looking for and given the choices                               designer themer or developer how many                                people here and you can be more than one                                how many people here are designers ok                                themers alright developers cool alright                                developers this actually is going to be                                pretty relevant to you because it's                                going to give you some insight into it                                into what we do quick poll this is sort                                of unrelated to what we're doing here                                but I just like to ask people this from                                time to time how many people here hear                                the word themer and and immediately                                understand what that means and what that                                involves ok how many don't how many                                don't have a clue what a themer is and                                what that's supposed to mean okay cool I                                think that that is and Adam is one of                                them this is just sort of an aside it                                seems that the role of themer is kind of                                unique to Drupal in that it requires a                                cross-section of skills and that                                cross-section is something that we're                                gonna be touching on just a little bit                                so we've waited a couple minutes we                                should get started                                welcome to don't design websites design                                web systems very quickly we'll introduce                                ourselves my name is Todd me and Kirk I                                am a co-founder designer and developer                                at four kitchens were a small drupal and                                an open-source consulting shop in Austin                                Texas but we make big websites I'm                                really into Drupal I love Drupal I love                                coming to events like this I'm primarily                                a designer                                I'm also developer and in a previous                                life I was a writer and editor my name                                is Adam Steadman everyone hear me OK by                                the way using this lapel thing and it's                                not probably as loud as the hand mic but                                hopefully if somebody's listening that                                can raise the lapel mic ok good maybe                                not I'm a design director at a branding                                and design agency in New York City                                called think so creative                                and if Todd will advance my little icons                                I'm very into designed I've been doing                                it for many many years                                user experience is something I'm really                                passionate about content strategy also                                an information architecture and I'm an                                unrepentant cat person I hope that's                                okay with everyone in this room so the                                the designer and the developer or the                                the themer and the developer are the                                Batman and Robin of building websites                                this was actually not chosen because of                                tonight's event but rather in general                                depending on who you are and where                                you're coming from you might pick                                yourself to be Batman or yourself to be                                I don't know who would pick Robin but                                the other person is usually sort of seen                                as the Robin right so together we form                                some kind of a dynamic duo and in this                                case we're going to be talking about                                designers and themers slash developers                                and Adam in this case is the designer                                and I'm going to be the Drupal theme err                                slash developer in this presentation so                                what do we mean by websites versus web                                systems so in the old days                                who remembers the old days of the                                internet web sites were measured in                                pages who remembers this my web site is                                five pages how much will it cost for you                                to make an eight page web site and this                                was because each of these pages were                                single files they were HTML files that                                had to be maintained by hand so it made                                sense to split it up into pages because                                that was the scope of work you knew how                                long it would take you to make one page                                as opposed to                                   but today's websites are dynamic meaning                                that they're always changing the content                                in them changes not necessarily along                                with files that run the website                                today's web sites allow maintainer x' to                                create and edit content directly through                                the website so you click Edit on a node                                 you're on the website changing the                                 website itself and they generate their                                 own output and that's because today's                                 websites are actually web systems                                 today's websites are software and that's                                 a big distinction so things have changed                                 quite a bit in only a few years the big                                 point we want to make today is that                                 designers are                                 incredibly powerful and a lot of us                                 don't know it but with great power there                                 must also come great responsibility                                 designers designers determine a site's                                 functionality not developers and we                                 communicate this functionality to the                                 developers who implement our designs                                 through various tools and and products                                 of our trade through sitemaps wireframes                                 site comps or design comps things like                                 process flow diagrams all kinds of                                 things that we give them that explain                                 what's in our head so let's consider the                                 login link right                                 the humble login link on a design comp                                 it's six characters two words but it                                 tells an incredible story because in                                 order to log in users have to be able to                                 create accounts they have to reset                                 passwords they have to update account                                 information and then there's all kinds                                 of other stuff like permissions now that                                 you have users some users should do                                 things that others shouldn't there's                                 privacy issues some information should                                 be publicly visible some should not you                                 also have to deal with an email system                                 if you're doing password resets you have                                 to have an email system that interacts                                 with that user so that they can reclaim                                 that password now you have to worry                                 about having your website on a server                                 that can properly send email and what                                 happens if that server address is                                 blacklisted and it's going into spam                                 filters and things like that these are                                 our serious issues that we have to                                 contend with all because we put those                                 two words on a design comp login right                                 we forget how much power we are placing                                 in a design by doing something so small                                 so we designers are a sites primary                                 architects                                 thank you tada thank you and so we're                                 gonna talk about what what so we're                                 gonna talk about what we mean and what                                 the different steps that we take when                                 designing a web system and thinking                                 systematically thinking about websites                                 in that way and the first step is to                                 stop and close Photoshop right it's not                                 time to push pixels around you wouldn't                                 paint a house before you build it and so                                 there's no way that you would ever try                                 to design a site without doing all this                                 preliminary architecture and thinking                                 before you're even ready to start                                 deciding what color anything is how's                                 that is that better okay thank you                                 step one would be define the site right                                 and this step is is divided up into a                                 lot of pieces and a lot of key questions                                 that you need to answer at this phase of                                 the game yours for them what's the                                 purpose of the site right that's                                 something and everyone needs to know                                 before they set out to build a website                                 what is it gonna do we want to know who                                 the audience is and who the site is for                                 that's going to influence a lot of the                                 decisions we make down the road we want                                 to know what the content is going to be                                 and how we're gonna organize that                                 content and we want to know how people                                 are going to experience the site and                                 interact with it all right this is                                 everything that has to happen before we                                 actually design anything so to talk                                 about the purpose of the site the what                                 you're trying to do to answer this                                 question is to start gathering goals and                                 requirements and the way we do that is                                 typically in kickoff meetings with the                                 client or doing interviews with key                                 stakeholders to try to sort of gather                                 all the important people in the room and                                 make a list of their business goals for                                 example which might be things like                                 generating buzz for a new product it                                 might be to raise awareness for an                                 existing product it might be building a                                 community around a topic or an                                 initiative it might be to make some                                 money it might also be making more money                                 than the money they're already making                                 and you might want to throw in a few                                 little other bits of money that seems to                                 be on a lot of people's mind how to make                                 money online                                 but once we have sort of those goals we                                 can start to think about what the                                 requirements and constraints are going                                 to be so that when we go into later                                 phases of the design process we know                                 what we're dealing with things like                                 brand guidelines are you working for an                                 established company that has a set of                                 guidelines in place that dictate                                 typeface color logo grid system things                                 like that there might also be SEO                                 requirements that you're going to need                                 to think about what what sort of                                 strategy might they have in place for                                 that sort of thing                                 there's also accessibility issues are                                 you working on a government site that                                 needs to be accessible in way stricter                                 ways then a new product launch site                                 might be what's your strategy for mobile                                 devices are you gonna build a responsive                                 site that adapts to whatever environment                                 it's in or you gonna do the sort of                                 split way of doing things where there                                 might be one mobile site and one desktop                                 site there's also infrastructure issues                                 any any kind of server or hosting or                                 technology platform issues that might                                 influence design decisions that you make                                 down the road and there's also things                                 like performance and browser                                 compatibility we all deal with browser                                 compatibility it's sort of the ugly                                 stepchild that rears its head on every                                 site that we end up making it's                                 definitely something to think about                                 so once we've gathered all those things                                 we've made our big list we've talked to                                 stakeholders we can sort we can decide                                 who the audience is for our site and                                 this is a really important step that                                 that can can get left out and can't get                                 left by the wayside and the way we do                                 that is to create personas                                 of everyone as anyone this room worked                                 with personas before all right good                                 that's a lot of hands so what is a                                 persona this is what you do when you                                 make a persona the first step for us is                                 to make a list of the target audiences                                 and describe who we think our visitors                                 are going to be and what you want to do                                 is you want to create one persona for                                 each of those target audiences and you                                 want to give that persona at least a                                 name an age a face a reason for visiting                                 and a wish list of tasks are going to do                                 on the website so here's an example all                                 right here's a persona this is a random                                 person I don't know who this person is                                 but I've created this persona the                                 audience type that I am considering here                                 is New York City based graphic designers                                 I know that they're gonna be ones that                                 want to visit this site I know that this                                 person is                                                                face I know that they're coming to the                                 site that I'm working on called sweet                                 plaid shirts calm because this guy has                                                                                                        shirts he buys them regularly he was                                 recommended to shop at the site by a                                 good friend and his wish list when he                                 gets to the site what are the things                                 he's going to be doing he wants to be                                 able to sort available shirts by                                 criteria like most popular newly added                                 he wants to see what shirts as friends                                 have purchased you don't want to make                                 that faux pas of buying the same shirt                                 that your friend has and wearing it to                                 the same event that's really                                 embarrassing and he might want to sign                                 up for an account to save preferences so                                 now that I've made this persona what                                 this lets me do is as I continue the                                 steps in the design process at every                                 step of the game I can make sure refer                                 back to my personas I've created and see                                 am i satisfying the needs and reasons                                 for all of my target audiences and it                                 becomes much easier to do that                                 especially when you're talking directly                                 with clients if you can talk about Adam                                 who's                                                               instead of the generic target audience                                 of New York City based graphic designers                                 right it makes it makes this nebulous                                 concept of the target audience into                                 something concrete that's easy to                                 discuss and easy to keep in mind all                                 right we're in step                                                    what's the content and how is it going                                 to be organized and the way we do that                                 is we define our content types and                                 create a sitemap so in Drupal along with                                 any other content management system                                 different types of content our content                                 types and these things are defined by                                 the different pieces of information that                                 they contain here's an example if we are                                 doing a site with a blog as a component                                 we know that the blog post is                                 type and because it's a blog post I know                                 it's going to have these sorts of                                 elements it's gonna have a title author                                 date published etc if we were talking                                 about a product site like in our shirts                                 example a shirt is going to have a name                                 a description a price these are two                                 examples of products I can go ahead and                                 list the the different information                                 elements that make up that product type                                 and once I've done this I have a really                                 good idea of the the basic building                                 blocks the content building blocks that                                 my site is going to be dealing with and                                 then we can take that information and                                 start to make a site map with it so site                                 map should do these basic things it                                 should list sorry it should list all the                                 sections and pages of a site and it                                 should illustrate how those sections are                                 organized sitemaps are pretty basic I'm                                 sure everyone in this room has dealt                                 with and created sitemaps in the past                                 here's an example of one the important                                 thing that to note is that everything                                 that's an actual page that can be                                 reached to the URL needs to be                                 represented in some way on a sitemap                                 sometimes we take shortcuts for things                                 content that is very similar like a blog                                 post for example we would represent as a                                 stack of pages instead of a discrete box                                 and that that is a shorthand way of                                 saying these are all the same type of                                 thing there's a lot of them but I'm I'm                                 indicating on my site map where that                                 page is in the overall hierarchy of the                                 site once we got the content under our                                 belts we can sort of create our                                 wireframes and what do wireframes do for                                 us so they're supposed to they do a lot                                 of things actually they illustrate                                 navigation and layout it's the time to                                 do that they're gonna demonstrate                                 functionality and show how elements of                                 our user interfaces are going to work                                 they identify static versus dynamic lee                                 generated elements that are on each page                                 and they can help us identify all the                                 unique layouts we're going to have to                                 consider when we actually get to visual                                 design here's an example of a sitemap                                 very simple site with a lot of dummy                                 content in it but you can see how we're                                 starting to frame out and and answer all                                 of those bullet points in the previous                                 slides so we're indicating some main nav                                 here in this wireframe                                 we're also hinting at some of the UI                                 we're going to use I can see here that                                 I'm gonna have some sort of search                                 interface there and I'm also going to                                 have a tabbed interface to kind of view                                 the same type of content according to                                 different criteria I have an example                                 here of dynamic and curated content so I                                 can I'm pretty sure from that list over                                 there that those articles are going to                                 be dynamically fed in that's not                                 something any editor is gonna have to be                                 responsible for maintaining and I can                                 see in the center here that this is                                 something that an editor would be                                 responsible for per tip for maintaining                                 its hero articles featured articles I                                 can also see from my wireframes the                                 different layouts I'm gonna have to                                 contend with us any site you do will                                 probably at least have these two things                                 would be a home page layout and an                                 interior page layout of course most of                                 the sites we build being as complex as                                 they are have many more layout templates                                 than this but the wireframes let us put                                 all these these different templates next                                 to each other and get a sense of how how                                 large a set of things am I going to have                                 to be designing once I get to the visual                                 design phase as far as tools for                                 creating wireframes we're gonna we're                                 gonna insert a few tips here and there                                 this is something that Todd introduced                                 me to and I've grown to really love it's                                 called balsamiq mockups has anyone used                                 balsamiq mockups to make wireframes okay                                 awesome we won't spend too much time                                 explaining it but for those who don't                                 know what it does it's you can use it in                                 a desktop version and it also has a                                 web-based version that I have not used                                 but that fosters kind of collaboration                                 between teams and let teams easily work                                 on the same the same set of wireframes                                 but it's cross-platform it's got a lot                                 of plugins they even have a free license                                 for do-gooders which is great and there                                 are Drupal components that that what are                                 those of you talk can you explain that                                 better than how the Drupal components                                 work okay they're pre-built UI                                 components that sort of plug directly                                 into Drupal and are made to work very                                 well with it and time and budget                                 permitting this is sort of an extra                                 yep that we love to do with our clients                                 but not every client we work with has                                 the time or the budget to do it we do                                 some usability testing and the the                                 purpose of the usability testing is to                                 validate all the assumptions that you've                                 made up to this step you know you're                                 doing sitemaps you're doing wireframes                                 you're making a lot of assumptions about                                 how the target audience is you're trying                                 to reach are going to think about your                                 site and interact with it and it's great                                 to make sure you are right about those                                 assumptions and the way you do that is                                 with testing and usability testing                                 sounds kind of big and scary and                                 expensive but it doesn't have to be                                 right there there's a continuum of                                 usability testing and it can be                                 everything from a very quick sketch                                 drawn on a napkin and shown to someone                                 it can go as far as paper prototypes                                 which we'll talk about a little bit                                 later you can also develop keynote                                 prototypes which are basically using                                 keynote to simulate the interactions of                                 a piece of functionality or your                                 interface or the navigation of an entire                                 site and you can go as far as doing real                                 live HTML and CSS prototypes for what                                 you're doing                                 and now we're up to you thank you this                                 thing is very sensitive choose a                                 platform okay so now we've done all of                                 this architecture stuff right notice at                                 no point so far have we said Drupal or                                 Joomla or expression engine or anything                                 like that because we want these initial                                 phases the initial phases to be more                                 independent of a content management                                 system so at this point knowing all the                                 things that you need to do and all of                                 the kind of navigation and UI that you                                 need to perform and the goals of the                                 site that's when you can make an                                 informed decision about the platform                                 that you're going to use Drupal isn't                                 always the best solution so before you                                 get angry I want to explain that if                                 you're doing something like building a                                 simple blog and it's just going to do                                 typical blog stuff and nothing more and                                 it won't have users                                 WordPress is probably better for                                 something like this if you're doing I                                 won't get into others there are other                                 content management systems out there but                                 be careful about what you choose because                                 Drupal is great it's really powerful but                                 as we all know it can be very                                 complicated so we want to make sure that                                 we're making the best decision platform                                 wise for the project based on the goals                                 that the client has outlined once you've                                 chosen this platform you need to                                 translate everything into Drupal speak                                 or you know insert content management                                 system here speak every content                                 management system has its own jargon and                                 its own way of doing things so we need                                 to start translating all of these goals                                 UI elements navigation components into                                 things that speak to Drupal very quickly                                 this is very basic stuff for everybody                                 here but as a reminder most Drupal sites                                 are comprised of just a small handful of                                 things so there's this notion of content                                 right that's easy but it's not always a                                 node we need to think of content as                                 views panels user profiles forms admin                                 interfaces contexts anything that                                 appears on the page is essentially                                 content there are also blocks menus                                 primary and secondary links stuff like                                 that typical theme elements typical UI                                 elements in drupal that's part of your                                 drupal speak vocabulary and you need to                                 start translating wireframes into into                                 these terms in these concepts so now now                                 we've done all of this other stuff it's                                 time to do the visual design so go ahead                                 and open Photoshop now you can make an                                 informed decision about how to create a                                 compelling and effective design you                                 couldn't really do this before because                                 you didn't know the goals you didn't                                 know how the users would interact with                                 the site you didn't know who is using                                 the site you didn't know what platform                                 you're using if you started doing design                                 before this point you're just gonna have                                 to redo it all some things to consider                                 when you're building the visual design                                 you need to consider how type color                                 imagery will translate a client's brand                                 to the web in many cases clients don't                                 really feel comfortable on the web or                                 they've most of their materials are                                 physical so they they understand the                                 physical world or they understand print                                 but they don't really understand the                                 unique complexities of the web and it's                                 to use the designer to help them                                 translate that one of the things that we                                 do that's really helpful is we want to                                 generate this kind of discussion we want                                 to generate a little bit of                                 brainstorming with a client using some                                 tools such as mood boards and style                                 tiles and very quickly and this could be                                 a presentation unto itself and I highly                                 recommend that you look up Samantha                                 Warren I'll have a little link later on                                 she's with phase two she does a lot of                                 stuff with style tiles and they're                                 really neat and I'll explain what those                                 are in just a moment                                 using mood boards and style tiles are                                 faster and much cheaper than doing a                                 bunch of iterations of comps so if you                                 do a comp you have to do you know two or                                 three different page layouts and you                                 have to fix all these little things and                                 there are all these little details and                                 then you show them to the client they                                 come back with                                                         to redo it and you kind of cycle back                                 and forth with these large bulky                                 documents but mood boards and style                                 tiles give you some insight into what                                 they're what they want to do before you                                 actually start building it it's going to                                 involve the client in the design process                                 so they feel more attached to it it's                                 not like you're some distant designer                                 who occasionally drops in and gives them                                 ideas and they kind of like it or they                                 don't or you know they don't really                                 understand what's going on it involves                                 them it's going to increase their                                 confidence and the the chance they're                                 going to buy into what you're doing and                                 they're also really fun to make so                                 here's an example of a mood board the                                 idea is really just a collage you want                                 to create a collage of color type                                 imagery ideas feelings                                 here's another these two evoke very                                 different moods right this feels a                                 little edgy new you know here we have                                 mtv wired jon stewart and here we have                                 baby you know this to me this seems like                                 this would be a baby boy                                 it Browns and blues and things like that                                 there's a little robot I mean they just                                 sort of I tend to feel that way and of                                 course it says boy right there now a                                 style tile is a little bit different                                 because it's not a collage it's a                                 sampling of graphical elements and a                                 color palette and type and the idea is                                 still to evoke a mood but now you're                                 moving more towards a website this this                                 looks much more like a website than this                                 right this doesn't look like a website                                 this looks like somebody                                 having fun pasting a bunch of things to                                 piece of paper which is exactly what we                                 did to get here but now we want to take                                 those elements and start to move in the                                 direction of the website and these style                                 tiles which Samantha worn at phase                                   uses quite a bit are really interesting                                 here's an example of three of her style                                 tiles for one project each of these                                 three look very different right but                                 these three are given to a client and                                 she asked the client tell me what about                                 each of these speaks to you and your                                 brand and your goals and what does not                                 and then they iterate through these                                 small things these are single pages they                                 iterate through these smaller things and                                 eventually arrive at a proper visual                                 design so it's more faster it's more                                 agile and you get the big stuff out of                                 the way type colors without having to                                 build a full comp here are three links                                 that are very useful they all begin with                                 bitly and they end with collab with                                 clients mood board style tiles and this                                 presentation will be available to                                 download on the London site later so if                                 you don't want to write all this stuff                                 down right now you can wait just a                                 little bit longer okay so we we spent a                                 lot of time in theoretical world and                                 we're gonna now move into the real world                                 and we put together this case study for                                 a client of think sews and for kitchens                                 called expeditionary learning and we're                                 gonna sort of show you how this whole                                 process played out for this one                                 particular project so who are these                                 people it's gonna help you to know who                                 they are as we go through expeditionary                                 learning they're an education reform                                 organization in the US and they partner                                 with schools and districts and school                                 boards to reform the curriculum of                                 schools and retrain teachers and                                 basically from top to bottom they they                                 orchestrate the entire learning                                 experience so if you have a school                                 that's not working how it should or it's                                 a brand new school it's being founded                                 you can bring in expeditionary learning                                 and they will reform the entire process                                 of learning at that school and Yale who                                 all called them from now on to save                                 myself from saying expeditionary                                 learning they partnered with                                 think so and brought in four kitchens                                 later to relaunch their brand and redo                                 their website so for some background                                 this is the previous logo for                                 expeditionary learning the name was                                 really long it's those five words I                                 don't I don't think I've ever seen the                                 name of organization take up this much                                 space they were an offshoot of a                                 us-based organization called outward                                 bound which is all about developing                                 leadership in children by taking them on                                 camping trips and basically doing things                                 outdoors so the expeditionary learning                                 at first had this reference to the                                 compass rose which is an important                                 symbol for outward-bound in their                                 original logo but a lot of sort of                                 problems for them with this logo not                                 just the length of the name but it was                                 very hard to reproduce on a lot of                                 printed materials because the logo has a                                 lot of fiddly and tiny details but this                                 is where they started and this was the                                 website that I started with it's not                                 it's not the most terrible starting                                 website I've ever seen but it's it's                                 clearly from the                                                       too it's not too long the architecture                                 seems to sort of make sense at first                                 glance it's it's clean I guess you could                                 say but it definitely doesn't project                                 the sort of professional and practiced                                 and established image that expeditionary                                 learning wanted to convey to the outside                                 world                                 so here's the results of the rebrand we                                 did for them this is the new logo we                                 developed it's it the key symbol in this                                 logo is this Chevron shaped crimson                                 signpost we ended up calling it and this                                 signpost symbol was a forward-looking                                 arrow it has all those connotations of                                 building for the future and training the                                 next generation of students kind of                                 baked into it it's it's also supposed to                                 be reminiscent and allude back to the                                 outward-bound legacy or the roots that                                 e-l has as a part of their DNA because                                 it kind of would resemble perhaps a sign                                 you might see on a hiking trail at a                                 trailhead that's pointing you in the                                 right direction                                 you want to go we also baked in some                                 tiny details to the e you can see the                                 the the inside of the e and the point of                                 the e is kind of referencing a half                                 compass in there it's not something that                                 anyone who sees this at first glance                                 ever notices but al had a few hang-ups                                 about distancing themselves too much                                 from their heritage and that was a nice                                 way that we could bake that in without                                 having it be to kind of hit you over the                                 head with where they came from and the                                 the type base we chose is a lot more                                 modern and progressive it's din                                 condensed and we used it in all caps for                                 the name and it was set just like that I                                 just want to show you a couple                                 applications to kind of give you a sense                                 of how the design system evolved here's                                 their business cards and these are                                 sitting on top of a folder so we we took                                 that symbol and blew it up and used it                                 big where it made sense it's kind of                                 varnished and some clear varnish on the                                 top of this folder and the symbol kind                                 of got to stand on its own and be                                 celebrated kind of decoupled from the                                 name on the business cards and it also                                 kind of handily points the way to the                                 relevant contact information which was a                                 good thing we also got to make flags if                                 anyone's ever made a flag or hasn't made                                 a flag it's awesome it's awesome to make                                 a logo that's eight feet wide and flies                                 up in the air with wind rippling and                                 dramatic music and it sort of translated                                 very nicely into a flag design and and                                 we showed this to them and they                                 immediately glommed on to the idea that                                 they could fly this flag on the staff of                                 the schools that are part of the e l                                 network and the EO organization now we                                 did a launch brochure so when the brand                                 first launched we wanted to create a                                 piece that really celebrated it and                                 introduced the new brand to all of the                                 teachers principals school designers                                 it's a their term for the the people who                                 actually go train the new teachers                                 everyone in their network basically that                                 would would be part of the this new al                                 that we were developing get them excited                                 about it show them with the new messages                                 we were creating at the new I guess the                                 new DNA that would make up the EO brand                                 we made this launch piece that was a it                                 was like tabloid newspaper size and it                                 out to everyone in the eel Network we                                 also created some field journals and                                 these got passed out to the students and                                 Yale schools the thing that is really                                 unique about their approach to learning                                 is the example I use is in my public                                 school growing up we would learn our                                 sort of bird Anatomy from the biology                                 textbook but if you're a student in                                 aniele school what you do is you go                                 outside of the classroom and you do your                                 own survey of all the birds in your                                 immediate area you take that data back                                 you meet with ornithologist or people at                                 the local museum to kind of help you                                 process your data and you pack that all                                 together and eventually present a field                                 guide of the birds of your immediate                                 neighborhood complete with drawings and                                 paintings                                 it sounds really awesome that made me                                 want to go back to school every time                                 that we talked to them about what the                                 student experience was like and we made                                 these field journals for the students                                 because it spoke directly to that                                 attitude of let's get out of the                                 classroom and go experience things and                                 learn in context instead of just reading                                 from books but then we had to address                                 this website and what were we going to                                 do and how did that work out so we have                                 our handy scale of theory versus                                 practice here's the theory side this is                                 the steps we've talked about it all made                                 sense it seemed to proceed logically                                 from beginning to end everything was                                 built on the thing before but                                 unfortunately for this project what                                 happened was we're starting at okay                                 we're defining the site but then we're                                 doing visual design we had to do we had                                 to sell the brand and develop directions                                 visual design directions to get yell to                                 choose which way they were going to go                                 we ended up doing I think three                                 different directions before they settled                                 on one and part of that was doing a lot                                 a visual design upfront to show how the                                 different options we were showing them                                 would eventually be applied for the                                 website specifically we didn't yet have                                 a development partner at the table or a                                 contour a CMS in mind so we started on                                 visual design first which has definitely                                 made it harder down the road as you'll                                 see then we chose our platform                                 then we translated into Drupal speak                                 with the help of four kitchens and Todd                                 and his team and then we went back and                                 revisited some of the decisions we made                                 in the site definition process and some                                 of the decisions we made in the visual                                 design because we ended up because we                                 didn't have Drupal in mind and we didn't                                 sort of do things in the right order we                                 ended up designing things that were                                 either not possible to do in Drupal or                                 really expensive and would not have been                                 the best use of Els budget to actually                                 execute so I'm gonna take you through                                 step one we define the e-l site and and                                 we talked about goals and requirements                                 these were the basic goals for the site                                 we were setting out to do it's mainly to                                 communicate yells mission vision and                                 methods we wanted to of course translate                                 this new brand identity that everyone                                 was excited about to the web and do it                                 justice and we had another mandate to                                 create and design secure online tools                                 for all of Els teachers that would help                                 them collaborate with each other and                                 plan their lessons and and basically                                 implement the unique approach to                                 learning that this organization takes we                                 then decided on the audience so these                                 are just some of the personas we                                 developed I think we ended up with seven                                 the important thing to notice here is                                 that we tried to represent all of eals                                 audiences in these personas and that                                 meant using people of all different ages                                 genders races backgrounds we had a mix                                 of students teachers principals                                 policymakers public figures we ended up                                 with sort of a very nice representative                                 set of personas that help guide us                                 through the rest of the project                                 now we then moved to content because we                                 didn't have a partner at the table yet                                 we we kind of skipped the content type                                 step which is something that would be                                 have night would have been nice to have                                 done at this point but we went right to                                 site map and here's the site map we                                 created and as you can see it was very                                 large and complicated as far as how it                                 tracks to the goals we mentioned                                 previously sort of all of this stuff                                 over here was all about communicating                                 the mission to Els core audiences and                                 over there was the secure online                                 tools another kind of pitfall of this                                 process was that what looks like a very                                 simple column of information that looks                                 simple secure online tools there's six                                 things how hard could that be to execute                                 and build well it turns out well if we                                 had fast forwarded we would see that                                 just one of these tools which we called                                 the planner is actually more accurately                                 represented by these these fifteen boxes                                 interconnected boxes over here and                                 that's just we just didn't know at first                                 what we were going to be getting                                 ourselves into and so it would have also                                 helped to have been able to see that                                 before we proceeded so how are people                                 gonna experience the site we wanted to                                 do wireframes of course and we this is a                                 look at what our wireframes look like                                 these are we're mostly concerned with                                 content but I can see that I'm doing                                 those things that I need to do in                                 defining those elements I need to define                                 I have my main nav sort of demonstrated                                 here I have some section nav over here I                                 have second secondary Navis phase I know                                 I have a search bar up in the secondary                                 nav but aside from that this example                                 doesn't really have much user interface                                 elements determined I can also see from                                 here that I am developing a hierarchy of                                 information on my page so I have my page                                 title and intro I can assume that on                                 pages of the site there's going to be                                 some sort of large big picture                                 introductory message when I get to a                                 page of content I have my main content                                 underneath and I'm gonna have some                                 sidebar or ancillary information over to                                 the right so that those wireframes were                                 for the mission and vision part of the                                 site we ended up in this process                                 actually working on the online tools and                                 the mission and vision stuff separately                                 and so we did another wireframe process                                 that was only dedicated to the                                 interactive tools we wanted to develop                                 and this is literally how those tools                                 started before we came to e/l these were                                 the tools that their teachers were using                                 to plan lessons right there were                                 actually pieces of paper they would                                 print out and                                 they would fill in all the boxes all the                                 red scribbles or my notes from hours of                                 conversations with people inside al that                                 that basically had explained to me how                                 they use these what their terminology                                 was how they fit within their usual                                 process this is what they look like in                                 their the way al structures its learning                                 is that you have what's called the                                 learning expedition that's the big                                 long-term thing students working on you                                 have a project a learning expedition                                 might be made up of three different                                 projects and then you have an individual                                 lesson that tells a teacher what they're                                 doing on a particular day and so these                                 things have a hierarchical relationship                                 to each other now here's a look at what                                 the wireframes look like for these tools                                 they're they're a little bit more                                 detailed as you can see from the others                                 from a user interface perspective we                                 ended up creating a whole deck of these                                 that basically represented every screen                                 and every interface you would see while                                 you were using these project planning                                 tools and the reason we did that is so                                 that when we eventually had our                                 development partner we would have a                                 serious handbook that we could sit down                                 with them and say this is exactly what                                 we need to build and we need your help                                 to build it so it was ended up being                                 really useful for for kitchens to have                                 this kind of Bible that they could refer                                 to when it was time to think about how                                 they were going to approach the project                                 and actually to guide them through the                                 actual build phase we also made some                                 process flow diagrams Todd alluded to                                 these earlier but we didn't really touch                                 in them in any detail we just created                                 some diagrams that gave a little bit                                 more background on some of the aspects                                 of the wireframes that might not be                                 totally apparent on first glance so we                                 wanted to for example illustrate how                                 when a teacher goes into the tool to                                 create a new learning expedition these                                 are the steps they would follow just to                                 help the developer and al understand the                                 workflow from logging in - yes I've                                 created a new expedition we then we're                                 fortunate enough to get to do some                                 usability testing and for this client                                 we ended up right there on the continuum                                 paper prototypes we we had this handy                                  deck of wireframes we created and we                                  just printed those out on large sheets                                  of paper and went to their national                                  conference and sat in a room with Yale                                  teachers between sessions and gave them                                  a list of tasks do you know create a                                  learning expedition link this project                                  with this expedition you already created                                  email a link to this project you made -                                  to someone else in the network and we                                  observed what they did and we would act                                  as kind of a human computer basically                                  putting down the new sheet of paper that                                  correspond to the screen they would see                                  and they would use their finger as the                                  mouse pointer and sort of talk talk us                                  through their thought process out loud                                  and it ended up being really valuable to                                  do we sort of were validated and got to                                  see that a lot of the decisions we had                                  made were actually corresponding to the                                  teachers mental model of what the                                  experience should be and the feedback                                  from those sessions was really really                                  positive there were also a few pitfalls                                  that we didn't notice or assumptions we                                  had made that they brought up that were                                  really great to know about and that's                                  something that seems to always happen                                  with usability testing something you you                                  think is really obvious because you're                                  so close to the project and every aspect                                  of it ends up not being obvious for a                                  real person that's using your stuff so                                  um fortunately we were able to correct                                  those mistakes early on so we we defined                                  the site we have our complete definition                                  now we can actually do a visual design                                  this is this became step                                                of not so smooth process but this is                                  what the site looks like and you can see                                  our kind of branding goals how these are                                  tracking to this visual design we have                                  our logo nicely and prominently                                  positioned at the top left we have our                                  typography figuring prominently in the                                  main navigation we ended up using the                                  signpost a little pointer as a prominent                                  element on a lot of design like you saw                                  before but on the website in specific we                                  used it to contain the tagline that we                                  developed                                  for expeditionary learning we get a                                  sense of the imagery here we knew we                                  wanted images that would communicate the                                  emotional experience of students at il                                  schools we thought those would be the                                  best way to sell what al is all about                                  let's show the kids in their environment                                  learning and shows sort of the joy and                                  the sexual pride and what you're doing                                  that comes from being in an Al school                                  and this page also gives you a sense of                                  how we're applying color throughout the                                  brand crimson is a very signature color                                  that came through actually because al                                  was originally conceived at the Harvard                                  School of Education so we wanted to sort                                  of make another nod to that part of                                  their legacy in this heavy use of                                  crimson which is one of Harvard                                  University's signature colors we also                                  developed a grid so we knew our design                                  this complicated and robust with the                                  many many layouts we're going to have to                                  execute we want a nice strong grid in                                  place and that's what that grid looked                                  like something that I did for this                                  project that I don't always do is create                                  a baseline grid also and try to have                                  every every element every image every                                  piece of typography every bit of white                                  space kind of conform to lines of this                                  baseline grid to really set up a nice                                  strong rhythm as you move down the page                                  it's something that is not easy to do                                  online and it's not something I always                                  end up thinking is useful or the better                                  said you might spend time better this                                  time better spent on other aspects of                                  the design than implementing a strict                                  baseline grid because the web as we know                                  is not print so some of these things                                  don't always translate in the web world                                  I'm not totally                                                           necessary but for this site we did it it                                  ended up being good though it was it was                                  hard to do and I wouldn't necessarily do                                  it for every site that we work on here's                                  a look at the different layouts we ended                                  up creating so we have our home page                                  here on the Left we have a landing page                                  layout on the right and I'm sorry in the                                  middle and we have an inch                                  your page layout on the right and you                                  can see sort of what we're starting to                                  do with the signpost in particular is it                                  it stays on the page as we move to                                  different levels of the site but it's                                  it's performing almost a wayfinding                                  function for you so on the home page is                                  very large on the landing page it's a                                  little bit smaller but still containing                                  the title of the page that you're on and                                  then when you get to an interior page                                  it's actually used as the highlighting                                  element in the sub navigation on the                                  left so it's this reinforced signal                                  along with the red of this is exactly                                  where I am in this site that's comprised                                  of a whole bunch of content we also do                                  kind of a step down thing with the                                  imagery to sort of indicate that you're                                  getting deeper and into more                                  detail-oriented areas so I have big                                  image on the home page I still have an                                  image on primary landing pages but once                                  I get inside the site that image goes                                  away and we just have the title so sort                                  of at first glance these pages look like                                  the level that you're on and you're sort                                  of web reading navigation experience                                  it's just a closer look at how that                                  landing page works and looks like here's                                  more of the imagery I was talking about                                  we try to emphasize college readiness                                  that's one of L's real themes they want                                  to show that their way of learning which                                  is kind of unorthodox actually prepares                                  students for college just as well as any                                  other approach would or and even better                                  in many cases and so we wanted to sort                                  of incorporate that idea into the                                  imagery we were using I can see here if                                  I check back to my wireframe I created                                  that I'm tracking pretty well - all the                                  elements I've already laid out so                                  because we did a kind of detailed and                                  good job with these wireframes making                                  sure that all of our t's were crossed                                  and our eyes were dotted that I know                                  when I get to visual design this is                                  exactly what I have to account for and                                  and so I can just see that yes I'm doing                                  that in addition to those three main                                  layouts we had other kind of unique                                  unique interface elements or types of                                  pages that needed some additional design                                  work we couldn't we couldn't have just                                  handed off those                                        to developer and say go build stuff                                  because we had things like a blog with                                  extra categories and the the different                                  pieces of information that a blog post                                  needs that a regular page doesn't need                                  that we have to account for what do                                  comments look like where our categories                                  house isn't in the footer is it off to                                  the side how does that navigation that                                  the blog would use that other pages                                  wouldn't use appear on the blog pages we                                  also had a image gallery so this part of                                  the site was a showcase for the student                                  projects that al students have done they                                  they really felt that that part of their                                  curriculum really shows off their                                  approach so we created a special section                                  of the site to showcase that work and                                  this is what the galleries look like and                                  there were other elements and graphics                                  on the page like this data-driven stuff                                  charts and graphs that kind of                                  reinforced that yes our approach works                                  that we had to decide what do these                                  things look like and we had those online                                  tools we talked about those those needed                                  all their own interface work in addition                                  to all the stuff we already showed and                                  this is what one of the landing pages of                                  one of those tools look like it with                                  easy ways to browse and search a library                                  of documents and you could of course                                  click in and see information about                                  particular documents and share them and                                  rate them etc and at this point we ended                                  up choosing Drupal for e-l we weren't                                  totally sure that that was how it was                                  going to work out but after initial                                  conversations with those trusted people                                  that you call up and say hey I have this                                  item working on this is what it's about                                  who do you think I should go to for this                                  it ended up more people than not said                                  this is a perfect Drupal project and                                  that's how we ended up choosing Drupal                                  and eventually finding tada for kitchens                                  so as you can tell think so adamant                                  think so did a tremendous amount of work                                  before it was handed off to somebody who                                  now has to implement all of this stuff                                  that you've seen it was it was great for                                  us because it gave us a lot of materials                                  to work with we had very few questions                                  for them because they had already asked                                  all the questions of the                                  and we saw all these decks of wireframes                                  and visual designs and process flow                                  diagrams and all of this reasoning and                                  all of this thought and we knew that we                                  were in good hands                                  so everything was well explained and                                  well defined so what was left for us to                                  do besides building the site was                                  translating everything that they had                                  just done into Drupal speak so now we're                                  gonna have to think about everything                                  that they've done in terms of Drupal                                  ideally we would have done this                                  throughout the process but we had to                                  take a step back and look at the                                  wireframe so we saw these things across                                  the top and we asked them hey what's                                  what's going on here and think so came                                  back and said all those are the sections                                  of the site ok section so I hear                                  sections right I run that through my                                  little Drupal filter and I know that                                  it's probably gonna have the primary                                  menu item that'll probably be the                                  primary menu item somewhere and that we                                  may use say the context module to define                                  the a context that is the section so                                  when we're in a section of the site a                                  certain context is active a context is a                                  is a module for Drupal by the way if                                  you're not aware so we took another look                                  at the site map and we said what are                                  these things down here below the the                                  section titles and think so an L came                                  back and said well those are the section                                  landing pages so each section has a                                  landing page of some sort without                                  exception so we heard section landing                                  pages and we run that through our little                                  Drupal speak filter and we think well                                  maybe it's panels maybe it's a view but                                  we do know that it's going to have a                                  secondary menu that is specific to that                                  section so when you land on a secondary                                  when you land on a section and you're on                                  a section landing page there's going to                                  be unique menu to navigate just that                                  part of the site and here's an example                                  of one of those landing pages so looking                                  up here you know we're looking for                                  Drupal components at this part how do we                                  how do we translate this visual design                                  into Drupal speak we see the logo right                                  everybody knows the logo variable                                  breadcrumb they put that in the design                                  there's the search box so we're gonna be                                  using the search module or a patchy                                  solar or something like that we take a                                  look at the these links across the top                                  and we know that those are a primary                                  links because they correspond to the                                  section titles that we saw in the site                                  map we see this thing on the left and we                                  know looking through various design                                  comps that these are changing these                                  items in this left-hand nav are changing                                  so these are unique for each section                                  that's our secondary men                                  or secondary links across the top                                  there's another kind of menu but it's                                  the same throughout the site no matter                                  where you are so we decided that that's                                  going to be a menu inside of a block if                                  we scroll down the page a bit we start                                  to look at the content and we see this                                  thing at the top and then there's this                                  thing and that thing and it looks like a                                  whole bunch of blocks maybe so who here                                  knows what we use to assemble a whole                                  bunch of blocks there's lots of options                                  these days but what's the most popular                                  one panels anybody ok so we thought this                                  is a panel alright this is a panel                                  filled with blocks that's what the                                  section landing pages are going to be so                                  let's pretend we're clicking on what we                                  do here's an interior page and we look                                  at this thing and we don't really see                                  anything all that's special about this                                  interior page we see a lot of text we                                  see a little pull out quote here but                                  that's that's pretty much it nothing all                                  that special so we think this is just a                                  page node easy so to break this down we                                  know that this whole thing this this                                  top-level item the landing page all the                                  content below it is what they call a                                  section which means we call it a primary                                  menu item within a context they say that                                  that is a section landing page we know                                  that it's a panel because we saw the                                  wireframes in the visual design these                                  things below it are the section sub                                  pages and we translate that as secondary                                  menu items and we know from talking to                                  them that they're all going to be static                                  content so they're all page nodes and                                  finally we we had to revise a lot of the                                  site definition and a lot of the                                  elements in the visual design because                                  they had chosen Drupal at a stage that                                  wasn't necessarily optimal but sometimes                                  that's just how life is                                  so we went back and did some short                                  iterations on how we can Drupal eyes                                  this this design so that we can                                  implement it faster and cheaper                                  so speaking of faster and cheaper let's                                  also try to make things a little bit                                  better I want to give everybody some                                  practical advice and some of the things                                  that we do in order to accelerate the                                  design and implementation phase of the                                  process the first is to design on a grid                                  if you've been to design school this is                                  odd                                  but a lot of designers come into the web                                  design world and have not heard of grid                                  based design I want to give you an                                  example now how many Americans are in                                  the audience all right                                  do you recognize this no how about now                                  have you ever been to a national park                                  it's the unit system it was developed by                                  Massimo Vignelli an Italian designer                                  this for the National Park Service the                                  United States the idea was to create a                                  reusable unified grid system to print                                  out brochures on the thousands of                                  national monuments and parks in the                                  United States to minimize cost so the                                  idea is backing up here you could have                                  the Washington Monument the Lincoln                                  Memorial the Grand Canyon all of these                                  things printed in one unified design but                                  there's tons of flexibility here you can                                  make all of them look different but                                  they're printed on the same press on the                                  same paper with the same size and you                                  can cut them into halves and quarters                                  and eighths and all kinds of stuff they                                  wanted to create something that was very                                  efficient to print here's another                                  example of well this is an example a                                  grid based design on the web this is the                                  personal homepage of coy Venn who                                  designed New York Times comm and he also                                  does a lot of work with mark bolton who                                  did who's responsible for the design for                                  drupal.org and the rebranding and this                                  is an example of this pink here                                  represents the columns within a grid                                  based design grid based design is going                                  to save you time it's going to save you                                  money and it's going to reduce                                  frustration and what I mean is it's                                  faster to do it provides a very specific                                  restriction to work with them so that                                  you know your design is going to be of a                                  certain width you know that you're going                                  to have units of measurement of certain                                  widths you don't have an entirely blank                                  canvas to work in the restraints in this                                  case for you so therefore it's going to                                  save you time and it's going to reduce                                  frustration because if designers all use                                  grid systems we can pass our work among                                  each other and better understand what                                  was done so that we don't have to go                                  decode all of that CSS and all that                                  markup that was written a year ago by                                  somebody else and it's going to be a lot                                  easier to revisit your own projects if                                  you stick with some kind of a general                                  grid design philosophy                                  so for just a moment I want to meditate                                  on on this picture this is one of my                                  favorite examples of of Constraints so                                  here the shop owner has embraced the                                  constraint of having a small space above                                  the door to put a sign and instead of                                  putting some smaller open sign they've                                  done something creative and they're                                  still communicating open but it makes                                  passers-by stop and think because they                                  see those letters and they think oh I                                  get it open that's that's clever that's                                  funny                                  imagine how many more people are likely                                  to be interested in that store because                                  that shop owner embraced that constraint                                  so constraints are going to narrow the                                  scope of the design and encourage that                                  kind of creativity enforcing a grid                                  accelerates design while maintaining                                  order very quickly a good example of                                  this is the                                                         there's a Drupal theme you probably                                  recognise the                                                          that is what powers drupal.org don't                                  start at zero start at Drupal and what I                                  mean by that is we need to increase our                                  Drupal speak vocabulary earlier when I                                  was talking about translating things                                  into Drupal speak if you have a larger                                  Drupal speak vocabulary you can                                  translate visual designs and wireframes                                  much faster because you have more words                                  to describe that and what I mean is                                  understand obviously all the things in                                  core but there's all kinds of modules in                                  core that nobody ever uses so maybe they                                  would be useful to you if you'd enable                                  them and play with them and understand                                  what they do understand default blocks                                  and menus and theme regions and                                  variables and stuff like that do some                                  research understand the default output                                  and styling of Drupal it's very easy to                                  take a look at the default markup and                                  CSS in Drupal                                                         theme it's in core you can just enable                                  this thing look at the source that's all                                  the stuff that Drupal and contributing                                  out by default so before you have to go                                  override anything understand what it is                                  that it's doing by default you can                                  download it for six here and again this                                  these slides will be up later so I'm                                  going to kind of blow through the links                                  this is what it looks like it's ugly                                  the important part is not on the left                                  the important part is on the right the                                  source code that's what you want to look                                  at and understand something that a lot                                  of people forget about is that little                                  little tiny modules can save you all                                  kinds of time so if you're running into                                  some kind of a theming challenge chances                                  are other people have done it                                  and they sold it and they put it on                                  drupal.org but the trick is having to                                  find it right and there are thousands                                  and thousands of models out there I want                                  to give you a quick example so back in                                  the drupal                                                                of an issue in Drupal                                                 thing called C CK which is fields in                                  Drupal                                    by default it outputs all of the the                                  stuff in their own divs and so they just                                  stack on top of each other and that's                                  not particularly all that interesting                                  you can do inline but then you just have                                  a bunch of spans what if you want to do                                  you know comma separated stuff so if you                                  wanted to do a comma separated list                                  you'd have to override override a theme                                  the field template file write some PHP                                  to iterate through all those items in                                  the array spit them out do and implode                                  with a comma separation and it gets even                                  more complicated if you need to do comma                                  and write this that and the other what                                  if you want that kind of list then you                                  have to have a counter and then you have                                  to insert and at the end and it just                                  gets complicated PHP wise there's got to                                  be a better way right and there is it's                                  called the text formatter module it's                                  this tiny little module that you can                                  download and enable and it gives you all                                  these cool options so now instead of the                                  default plain text trimmed you also get                                  commas commas and commas and period                                  unordered lists ordered list this seems                                  pretty easy right but you enable this in                                  display fields you change it to commas                                  and you're done it's just a tiny little                                  module but if you didn't know to Google                                  for text for matter or whatever it would                                  be very hard to find right and that's a                                  challenge that we have in the drupal                                  community there's a page on drupal.org                                  drupal.org slash project slash modules                                  that's the main modules listing page the                                  two takeaways there are is that there's                                  a pretty decent searching and filtering                                  system there that you can try apart from                                  just using Google which is the obvious                                  solution you can try using this                                  filtering system but it also lists the                                  most popular modules in order so if you                                  go to that page you're gonna see all the                                  popular modules and chances are all the                                  big ones you're going to need to use to                                  increase your Drupal speak vocabulary                                  will be on that page also all about does                                  a cool feature on their blog called                                  module Mondays so every Monday they talk                                  about a module and you can learn all                                  about what it does and what it can do                                  it's part of their main blog                                  unfortunately there's not a link to go                                  directly to that term or that category                                  but you can just read their blog every                                  Monday                                  so the last thought we'll leave you with                                  before we wrap up is about designing for                                  a change and the main rules for                                  designing for change are to minimize                                  your templates the e/l site had a lot of                                  templates that we worked with actually                                  where there were three main templates                                  those had a lot of variables within them                                  but because we minimize that as much as                                  we could it meant there was less                                  maintenance going forward when we had to                                  change something or implement something                                  new it also is a great thing to have                                  consistent styling and this goes to                                  Todd's grid system point and also                                  writing your CSS in an efficient way and                                  doing visual design on elements that                                  repeat having those things all be in                                  sync and reference each other and                                  building on the same systems so you can                                  quickly create extensions of layout                                  patterns or individual interface                                  elements that you've already done                                  it also lets people see a new thing on                                  the site and instantly have an idea of                                  how to use it because they've seen it                                  somewhere else before or something much                                  like it                                  part of that is of course creating a                                  robust default template something that                                  happens down the line is the client or                                  site admin wants to create something new                                  that you might have not have accounted                                  for so if you as the designer make sure                                  you have come up with design or                                  specified rules and guidelines for all                                  of the elements that might happen down                                  the road you won't run into an issue                                  where someone wants to create something                                  and oops there's no design for it other                                  things that might happen is you want to                                  consider accommodating content of any                                  length it's great when your design is                                  robust enough to handle titles that                                  break to two lines or even navigation                                  sorry about that                                  we're gonna expand navigation if your                                  navigation increases by an extra item if                                  you started with five you have six                                  what's going to happen to your design if                                  you haven't been thinking about these                                  things ahead then bad visual things                                  happen the sometimes the answer is                                  navigation can't increase but the                                  important point is that you as the                                  designer have anticipated that might                                  happen and have come up with an answer                                  for it                                  and these all these things happen                                  because these sites were designing are                                  no longer pages right we talked about at                                  the very beginning it's not just six                                  pages of a site the site is a very large                                  system of all interacting components and                                  software this is the the main point Todd                                  made at the very beginning and because                                  everyone in this room is a designer                                  we're really the ones responsible for                                  that system where its primary architects                                  and all the decisions we make end up                                  impacting everything down the road so                                  thank you for your time looks like we                                  hit an hour exactly so if anybody has                                  any questions we're gonna be up here for                                  just a couple minutes but we're
