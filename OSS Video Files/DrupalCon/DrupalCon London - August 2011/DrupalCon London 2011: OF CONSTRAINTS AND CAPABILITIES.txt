Title: DrupalCon London 2011: OF CONSTRAINTS AND CAPABILITIES
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Dante Murphy
Angel Brown
In software design and development we often overlook the role of our customers in applying their own capabilities to achieve their goals, often creating solutions that are bloated, complex, and inefficient. We are also prone to look at constraints as obstacles rather than opportunities to bound and clarify the services we offer. By applying systems thinking, designers and devlopers can create idealized designs that deliver the most value to customers and businesses alike.

Here are the presentation slides and speaker notes:

Intended audience
Those who design, plan, architect, and evaluate software and digital services.

Questions answered by this session
What is systems thinking, and why is it important?

How does an idealized design differ from other types of design?

How can a mental model help in designing and architecting software?

Why are constraints good?

How do I know what my audience can and will do for themselves?

the only                               reason just try to keep your disruptions                               to a minimum and I just like to point                               out that I'm already married so I can't                               have a proposal during my presentation                               however for to keep the engagement high                               at the end

  about constraints and capabilities                                systems thinking and idealize design if                                you are going to tweet about this in an                                affirmative way please use sis think sys                                think if you're going to say something                                negative just use somebody else's                                hashtag and the thing I wanted to start                                off with is this photograph here which I                                don't know how many of you how many                                people here are our london london area                                ok have you seen this before it's                                familiar so why why did I put this                                photograph up here does anybody have                                care to venture a guess ok I didn't                                think you'd know that's why I wrote                                notes up here so this is a cleanup crew                                here that organize themselves using                                Twitter to go and clean up one of the                                tube stations i believe it was clapham                                one of the clapping stations there                                several and organize themselves over                                twitter and the thing about this that I                                found someone interesting was you see                                that none of these is wearing that                                lovely reflective Jersey that indicates                                that it's their job to do so what they                                did was they brought their capabilities                                into a system that was not functioning                                well right because of the riots there                                were not enough people on staff to do                                these various things and they went                                beyond the artificial constraints that                                said you're not responsible for cleaning                                up the tube station and they went ahead                                and did it anyway and they made the                                system which is the society work better                                so that's kind of the idea that we're                                going to talk about here but we are                                going to try and make it somewhat                                applicable to the world of Drupal I just                                wanted to make a link with what we heard                                this morning we were talking about a                                system a design system and the                                ingredients of that were a grid                                typography a hierarchy but what we're                                going to talk about today where user                                experience people and we exist because                                it's not just about flat design the web                                is transactional so there's more to it                                that's not enough that's not going to                                get you to good design there's a whole                                band of activities and research stuff                                that you have to do beforehand to allow                                you to plan the journeys to plan the                                functional needs and to get people to                                their destinations and that's where user                                experience people come in like us okay                                well I'm I'm angel Brown and I'm you                                extractor at digitas health I've been                                there since January I've been involved                                in web design since pages were gray                                thousands of years ago I remember                                finding out tables that's how we can do                                things I mean that's a long time ago but                                I'm really a designer but i'm a geek as                                well to a certain extent i had my own                                agency for ten years and i had to run                                all the tech teams so when they couldn't                                solve problems i had to do it cuz it the                                buck stop with me so i'm pretty savvy                                and i like looking at code I like                                understanding how things work and I                                particularly like drupal Digitas does a                                lot in Drupal and I've been working on                                it since I joined and it's going to talk                                a bit more about how we relate systems                                thinking to do for and my name is Dante                                Murphy my primary professional                                achievement has been being smart enough                                to hire angel i as the leader of the                                global experience capability i tend more                                to think sort of conceptually and try to                                establish frameworks so all of the                                high-minded things that are going to be                                said today or are probably going to be                                said by me and an angel is going to help                                give you guys some context for how to                                use the                                 but together I think that we're coming                                 from the same the same perspective i was                                 at i was a coder before the web my first                                 program that i worked on was actually                                 written before i was born in                                             written on punch cards in in cobol                                 anybody here a cobol programmer love for                                 you back there love love okay so yeah                                 and i haven't written a line of code                                 since then and and I I don't miss it a                                 lot design is where I belong so moving                                 on so what all right so how many people                                 in this room are our designers love know                                 exactly how many people are developers                                 how many people raise their butt their                                 hands both times you are the most                                 wonderful people in the world because                                 you understand it you understand that                                 that development is a design activity                                 and i think that's that's why you're in                                 this session probably what what is it                                 that we strive for in design who would                                 like to just call out some things that                                 we strive for indesign simplicity okay                                 that's great what's another one                                 organization okay what you say beauty                                 okay namely its clarity over here                                 clarity excellent usability good one yes                                 functionality is important as well yes                                 that one what he said delight yes                                 affordance yes okay so now you're                                 geeking out a little bit loving well I'm                                 glad to hear that that's several the                                 concepts that we're going to talk about                                 are included specifically well these                                 first two were definitely mentioned so                                 do we have anything else to add on this                                 slide well we were going to talk about                                 Etzel oh the Edsel right so does                                 everybody yeah that's what this is who                                 drives one I didn't think so so I want                                 to offend anybody this is one of those                                 epic failures of design and one of the                                 reasons for that was there was a lot of                                 design energy that went into it it                                 wasn't for lack of trying it was for                                 lack of vision and a lot of the                                 decisions that were made that that went                                 into this Carson technological                                 advances that were there were quite                                 revolutionary like putting the controls                                 for the the gear box in the center of                                 the steering column no one had ever done                                 that before probably because it wasn't a                                 very good idea but they went ahead and                                 did that and there are a variety of                                 other things adjustable brakes and the                                 way the speedometer worked and this                                 hideous our office here in the front and                                 a lot of it they just did it because                                 they could and they didn't have a sense                                 of things like simplicity and and beauty                                 and well maybe they were thinking beauty                                 I don't want to know what they were                                 thinking when they put that on there so                                 some of these ideas came from a                                 perspective of just well we can so let's                                 and and I think that in the immature                                 days of technology we've seen a lot of                                 that I mean who's plugged in a module                                 just to see what it would do right I'll                                 put my hand up to yeah so so we've all                                 kind of done that but I think that we're                                 starting to learn a little better hmm so                                 one of the first things that we talk                                 about is function has anyone read this                                 book design of everyday things or any                                 any of Don Norman's books actually if                                 you read his books in order you get to                                 see an interesting evolution of design                                 principles so it's it's really important                                 that a thing not only has the attributes                                 of functionality such as a handle and a                                 spout and a lid would anybody care to                                 pour this cup of tea look carefully                                 right you know not unless you were                                 wearing a nomex suit they have to work                                 together it has to be a considered                                 effort towards design                                 in some cases especially when technology                                 products are immature the functions                                 become the design in that sense applying                                 focus to the functionality helps the                                 products mature and become more                                 meaningful to their users I think we all                                 know about form versus function the                                 design principle everybody man on the                                 street knows about it obviously here you                                 know these things aren't going to work                                 podium would have been great show                                 somebody else mentioned simplicity as                                 who's read this one laws of simplicity                                 it's okay that I don't know that I give                                 it a glowing endorsement conceptually I                                 love the idea the specific laws of                                 simplicity that that might have uses                                 here are okay would anybody care to tell                                 me what simplicity means who said                                 simplicity when somebody can call that                                 out so tell me what you meant by                                 simplicity including the the smallest                                 amount of things on the screen to get                                 done what you need to do right so it was                                 it was what you need to do does anyone                                 think that simplicity means                                 unsophisticated well that was a leading                                 question wasn't it yeah it's it's                                 subtract mighta says it's subtracting                                 the obvious and adding the meaningful                                 and there's a reason why that quote is                                 up there but it's it's putting in the                                 things that are necessary or evocative                                 or exudative principles that you guys                                 talked about like beauty and delight                                 although in other words for engagement                                 usability often means taking things away                                 and that's what we're striving for when                                 we're talking about simplicity                                 another key and I didn't hear anybody                                 say it specifically but I'm sure that                                 you'll all agree when we're designing is                                 we're we're thinking about efficiency                                 how can we get done the most with the                                 least effort not necessarily because we                                 don't want to put the effort in is                                 anybody in here lazy besides me that is                                 oh my goodness too honest but it's but                                 but realistically I think what we're                                 trying to do is we're trying to get the                                 most done on this initiative or project                                 or product so that we can move on to the                                 next one so that we can continue to do                                 great things or make great money or                                 whatever it is that we want to do and                                 when we're thinking about efficiency one                                 of the ways as said in the quote here is                                 that you use the things that are around                                 you the things that are available rather                                 than creating things of your own I think                                 in many ways that's the essence of                                 Drupal right so that you have a                                 framework that does a lot of the heavy                                 lifting for you and then you can apply                                 the unique aspects of your design as you                                 go forward so we want to talk a little                                 bit about how these attributes of design                                 these affirmative attributes of design                                 are also ways of describing a system                                 because that's what we're talking about                                 today systems think and it's difficult                                 to characterize one part of a website                                 we're talking perhaps a block as                                 efficient if the navigation is                                 incomprehensible or the login is                                 unresponsive we're talk we need to think                                 about it holistically therefore we want                                 the system to express those desired                                 attributes of of being navigation to be                                 comprehensible and the responsive the                                 login to be responsive so but within the                                 domain of systems thinking we need to                                 explore this a little bit what is a                                 system                                 so what are some kinds of systems that                                 we work on let's hear them all                                 believe that one out we are experiencing                                 technical difficulties yeah please stand                                 by I think this is nicely nine okay so                                 who would like to call out a system                                 besides the system of swearing into a                                 microphone that I've just so abeley                                 demonstrated what kinds of systems                                 public transport nice the red anyone                                 else operating systems right so that's a                                 framework for technology design system                                 we had there are there are political                                 systems there are economic systems their                                 ecological systems they're all different                                 kinds and I think that in the Drupal                                 content yeah well we can think about it                                 in terms of the technology itself we've                                 got our core got our modules we've got                                 our themes etc but you can also think                                 about it in terms of the system being                                 the project that takes a group of people                                 and a technology through the process to                                 the end so therefore all the moving                                 parts are made up of subsystems and                                 that's the systems thinking way of                                 looking at it with information flowing                                 in between the subsystems and they're                                 all of those kinds of systems are very                                 complex many moving parts many                                 dependencies when we're talking about                                 something as finite as a project or                                 something as broad as a government yeah                                 or a client you know that the client                                 wanting it to be blue this is something                                 that's significant there is nothing                                 nothing more complex and more of a                                 moving part than a client yeah ok so                                 here we have an example of thinking                                 about the functions what is the function                                 of this system with which many of you                                 are are familiar where's the function                                 what does it do so moving people move                                 but not just moving people like you can                                 move somebody from here to there this                                 system doesn't allow you to move                                 somebody from here to there so why is                                 that important                                 because the limits of the limits of the                                 technology and the technology is limited                                 in what it can do this the system that                                 we are able to create and control is                                 limited what it can do thinking about in                                 the broader context if I want to go to a                                 theater over here I can get off this                                 system and apply my own capability of                                 walking there and I can get there in                                 that manner or having someone fetch me                                 at the station or taking a bus or                                 whatever else and part of that is                                 understanding what the relationships are                                 within the capabilities that we control                                 so these help us to understand what's                                 possible at any given moment the                                 relationships between these capabilities                                 we were talking about simplicity earlier                                 from aux perspective each block each                                 thing you put on the page communicate                                 something to the users and in my own                                 experience I've had evidence where users                                 SAT and saw oh there's a login that an                                 in prominent position ah I'm not going                                 to go to this site because it's a                                 community I don't want to invest time in                                 this I don't want to have to build a                                 profile etc so just by making it there                                 in the default spot it's communicating                                 something if you move it to the top                                 small link ah maybe I'll engage with the                                 content ah ok this is the type of site                                 for me I will make the investment then                                 these are small things but every                                 everything is significant and they all                                 contribute to an efficiency right so                                 achieving your goal without having to                                 put all those extra things on or putting                                 them in the correct context there's also                                 external influences that control the way                                 a system functions such as an industrial                                 action anybody here not from the UK or                                 not from Europe ok I love the term                                 industrial action because it sounds so                                 positive mm-hmm like I wish that in the                                 States we had industrial                                 I would feel so much better about it and                                 then I find out what it is I'm not so                                 chipper about it but this is one of many                                 ways that external factors can influence                                 how the system behaves and the system                                 has to be designed to account for that                                 what happens when there's heavy snow                                 what happens when there's an industrial                                 action what happens when there's a bus                                 strike and there's an added amount of                                 people on to it these are the things                                 that we have to account for another                                 factor is what else does the product do                                 so if I'm thinking about designing a                                 train station well what do I need that I                                 need some track and you know a roof                                 would be nice and perhaps some signs                                 that tell me which train is where but                                 wouldn't it be nice if there was a place                                 to go and get a nice fish and chips also                                 why would I want that has anybody here                                 ever purchased food in the train station                                 come on has anybody here ever purchased                                 food in the train station all right hey                                 so it's not because you thought oh the                                 the pinnacle of oat cuisine is going to                                 be at Waterloo station I know that's not                                 what you were thinking it's that it was                                 convenient because it was part of some                                 other activity I just wanted to talk a                                 little bit about simplicity again and                                 avoiding bloatware that's techies we all                                 know performance is a key aspect what we                                 would try and think about when we're                                 making a decision to put another module                                 in what does it bring with it how much                                 is this going to slow it down but what                                 the way I like to think about the users                                 and in terms of their attention being                                 almost like a performance metric so if                                 you've got lots of things on the page                                 their attention then it's difficult for                                 them it takes too much effort too much                                 cognitive effort it's a bit like don't                                 make me think so you find that these                                 features can create barriers and they                                 get exhausted and they leave                                 consider the first the first mobile                                 phone you had that had a camera in it I                                 don't know how many of you thought that                                 that was a wonderful idea at the time or                                 if it was just like well it's there or                                 if that's the reason you went out and                                 got that specific phone but at the time                                 it was an option it was a feature it was                                 something that not many people opted for                                 now my neighbor works for an aerospace                                 company where you're not permitted to                                 have a camera on the premises so he had                                 to go and find a mobile phone without                                 one as difficult as it was to find one                                 with                                                                  feature has now become a de facto                                 requirement but it's taken time it took                                 time for the context of use to demand                                 that it was that that was something that                                 users expected he keeps talking as he                                 were since the presentation there are                                 also emotional drivers now I don't know                                 how many of you would choose which tube                                 station you get on based upon the                                 quality of the musician who's playing in                                 the hallway you would have to be either                                 fantastically good or completely awful                                 and I've experienced both in my life but                                 we can think about this also in a                                 digital services context how does                                 emotion play a part in decision making                                 or in workflow and sometimes it's                                 relevant in things that you wouldn't                                 expect such as a banking site we were                                 talking earlier about mint and just the                                 way that you use it it's actually we're                                 thinking of gamification aspects of that                                 it's actually fun to use fun and even in                                 a context of say a banking site or maybe                                 a news site it's it's not something you                                 would normally put at the top of your                                 priority list however it drives the                                 engagement who here has heard of                                 gamification before quite a few of you                                 how can anybody think of an example that                                 that they have used where gamification                                 has has played a part in in their                                 decision yes sir                                 your LinkedIn profile the mall the more                                 you complete the mournful it puts a bar                                 with your profile and it keeps that                                 profile that bar their percentage bar                                 until it's got you to fill everything in                                 wait you and and then it'll vanish you                                 don't have to fill everything in but you                                 log in and see it haven't filled it up                                 yet and you feel compelled to do a bit                                 more than its passive aggressive it's                                 slightly irritating but it depends on                                 how obsessive compulsive York for those                                 who are not necessarily obsessive                                 compulsive is there anyone who can think                                 of something that's fun it's fun that's                                 functional yes achievements and websites                                 and point systems so where as you've                                 completed your profile for instance                                 which I don't perceive to be aggressive                                 you just get a                                 visited a number of sides the foursquare                                 badge concepts mmm yeah that's one                                 there's a reputation points on boxes and                                 arrows who's old enough to remember that                                 I didn't turn around cuz I don't want to                                 know so that's that's one of them you                                 said your bit I did yes I talked about                                 emotional factors around then I God okay                                 so we already talk quickly about the                                 idea of offline capabilities you know we                                 could have that tube map actually go                                 everywhere but that would require not                                 only a lot of digging but it would also                                 slow that system down because the tube                                 would have to stop every hundred meters                                 instead we have a system that's designed                                 for long-range transport let's say can                                 you remember how to do this all right                                 I'm teaching a skill here today as well                                 so we've got the tube system is designed                                 for longer distances and then we have an                                 ancillary function or a related system a                                 parallel system of buses that are                                 designed for shorter journeys and you                                 know we're talking about bloat again                                 another key factor to think about is the                                 environment in which your device or                                 system is going to be used in some cases                                 that environment is physical in some                                 cases that environment might be                                 service-oriented how does your tablet                                 device work when it's not connected to a                                 network or a projector much like our                                 device it's not working right now or how                                 how does it relate to noise levels or                                 your emotional anxiety that you may be                                 that you may be undergoing one of the                                 things that we deal with a lot in ours                                 in our work is people who are getting                                 bad news about their health and it's                                 very important that somebody understands                                 the implications and the options when                                 they hear the word cancer but when you                                 say the word cancer the next                                           that you say to that person they don't                                 hear because they're playing a movie of                                 their life in their head they're either                                 playing the movie of what's happened                                 or what's going to happen and that's a                                 reality so when you design your system                                 of communication understanding the                                 environment in which that communication                                 is going to take that cognitive                                 environment is extraordinarily important                                 because you can't assume that they're                                 going to remember anything that you've                                 said another critical factor is time now                                 clearly on the tubes time is very                                 important that you know when the trains                                 are coming and how long it takes to get                                 from one place to another it's possible                                 that your system is not necessarily as                                 time sensitive as a transit system but                                 one thing I can bet you is that the                                 people who are using it are time                                 sensitive no matter what it is they're                                 doing whether they're doing a sudoku                                 puzzle on their on their phone or                                 whether they are filling out some sort                                 of their booking a holiday they've got                                 other demands on their time so we have                                 to be sensitive to that and thinking                                 about all of these things as functions                                 that we need to account for in achieving                                 that simplicity in that efficiency that                                 makes our design good and the last thing                                 is appearance so we know that appearance                                 whether it be you know something                                 grid-based and typography based or                                 whether it just be the way it's                                 presented around other things can't                                 wriggle trigger a functional reaction                                 when they established when they sorry                                 what they see first establishes a                                 context of their experience the example                                 that you were giving about the login                                 blocks that becomes the appearance of                                 the site the meant the mental model the                                 way somebody pictures something and it                                 impacts how they use it I just wanted to                                 talk about that historically people used                                 to say Drupal sites all look the same I                                 think we've changed that a lot it was                                 because people would just do out of the                                 box okay there we go let's theme it                                 we're not going to think about design                                 we're just going to theme it but it's                                 different now theming is not the same as                                 designing if you look at Drupal Museum                                 calm I had to look at it the other day                                 and I thought it's we've come a long way                                 the sites are looking fantastic these                                 days and designers are obviously                                 involved UX people are involved so but                                 taking mental models as a starting point                                 we use I'm going to tell you a bit about                                 how we do this now we use constructs                                 like experience principles so we come up                                 with a set of ideas that define the                                 experience how we want it to look how we                                 want it to feel and we share this with                                 the project team with the client do we                                 all agree these are the principles for                                 the for the design of this system oh can                                 I do it on my own as well as Dante no I                                 can we get there okay rich user profiles                                 what do we do we build personas you've                                 heard of these things they need to                                 contain the detail that allow us to make                                 a decision on should we add a                                 gamification attribute here it's got to                                 have we've got asked those questions                                 when we're going out to research they                                 need to be rich they can't just be this                                 user is this age and you know uses a                                 mobile phone sometimes we need the                                 detail there moodboards benchmarking                                 these are things us designers will know                                 but these are tools that we do we use                                 and we're going to show you something                                 about mental models in a minute but we                                 need the developers at the table because                                 they provide the constraints and I'm                                 working very closely with with my lead                                 developer own project right now and I                                 say give me give me the mod model give                                 me show it show it to me in action then                                 I'll go away and all work out what we                                 need to hide or how we need to change it                                 faceted search for example is one we                                 just did the other day I think I don't                                 like the usability of how you add your                                 facets and remove them on that example                                 what are the constraints how far can I                                 go with this could it be a checkbox                                 these are the conversations we have and                                 this is what makes all the difference I                                 think because it's not that accessible                                 to us as as designers to know what the                                 modules will necessarily put on the page                                 it's not you often have have examples                                 but not always this is something I                                 really struggle with and that we need to                                 work together right and one thing that I                                 want to point out is when angel said the                                 word constraints what was what was                                 somebody who considers himself primarily                                 a developer what was your reaction when                                 you heard the word constraint                                 anyone what do you think about that did                                 it feel like that was a good thing or a                                 bad thing good are you saying that                                 you're just guessing what it's a good                                 thing tell me why it's a good thing                                 because it gives you space to work                                 without a constraints you can't know                                 where to study I did not pay him to say                                 that nor will I but that's right that's                                 or at least that's my opinion and I have                                 the microphone so each system each of                                 these system elements becomes an                                 attribute of the customers mental model                                 all the things that we talked about                                 functions appearance time all of these                                 things play a part how many are you                                 familiar with mental models has anybody                                 heard that term before yes okay does                                 anybody want it explained lucky you yeah                                 there we go here's an example this is                                 from a site we did episode epilepsy                                 epilepsy advocate so what we do here I                                 mean this is complex staff trying to                                 understand a mental map of suck the way                                 someone it understands the situation but                                 what we do is we break it down into                                 areas get support from others like me at                                 the green at the top there express my                                 thoughts and share my experiences                                 participate or host an event these are                                 the types things we get this out of the                                 research these are the key areas they're                                 almost like if you're used to working in                                 agile epochs perhaps okay then                                 underneath that let's see what are the                                 key tasks now I'm starting to think                                 about the journeys that I can map out                                 which then I can test on the site                                 connect with others like me find a                                 friend can talk to about epilepsy feel                                 like someone knows how I feel I mean                                 this is kind of an intangible thing but                                 it's significant feel like I'm not alone                                 be inspired by others like me read about                                 someone who has also as epilepsy I'm not                                 going to read the whole slide but I                                 think you're starting to get the idea                                 this is how we break them down and                                 provide a vocabulary and start a                                 starting point for scenarios and user                                 journeys                                 and at the bottom we also put down                                 things around content so we're starting                                 a content strategy at the same time it's                                 a map it's quite easy to do and the                                 reason why you would document it is to                                 get the project team around it signed                                 off okay this is the next block let's                                 move ahead easy to do is probably a                                 relative term it's there's nothing about                                 it that any of you can't do it does take                                 effort the process is generally that you                                 look at what people's tasks or goals are                                 you can get this through ethnographic                                 study basically following them around                                 another word for it is stalking that's                                 the creepy word or you or you can just                                 ask them straight up to tell you tell                                 you what they're interested in it                                 depends on whether or not you think                                 they're going to give you the real                                 answer because people don't always know                                 how to answer questions truthfully and                                 then down here that's that's a research                                 truth down here we have content where                                 we're talking about content we're not                                 always talking about articles or words                                 that people are going to read or things                                 that they're going to consume we're also                                 talking about tools that they might use                                 and in some cases this is color coded                                 it's a bit washed out for you but there                                 are some things here that we're saying                                 that we're going to do there are some                                 things that we're saying we're not going                                 to do and we're going to explain why                                 about that in a few moments when we're                                 applying the mental model to our project                                 what we're trying to do is we're coming                                 up with both functional and experiential                                 requirements so one of the one of the                                 goals that are customer put in their                                 persons suffering from epilepsy was I                                 want people to understand me well that's                                 awfully difficult to do functionally we                                 have to do that experientially so that's                                 one of the things that we tried to use                                 as a basis for creating our system and                                 we can have these things as these can                                 become the targets that we designed for                                 it's almost like a requirements document                                 that's not technology-based its people                                 based                                 and part of this is mapping capabilities                                 to the documented customer tasks and                                 goals essentially so the next step then                                 it's in very much so very much so and if                                 you have an opportunity to see Indy                                 speak a lovely person and you know                                 you'll look her for a half hour and                                 she'll stay for three days so very                                 accessible if you have a chance to see                                 or speak I recommend it highly it's a                                 very fast read to and what you'll find                                 I'll caution anybody who reads the book                                 you'll read the first chapter and you go                                 I'm done you're not keep going keep                                 going all the way through because it's                                 the iteration and the unfolding of the                                 process it's not cognitively complex but                                 actually doing it and reinforcing the                                 concepts it's not it's not that familiar                                 to everybody so I would encourage you to                                 get it and to read it and certainly to                                 read the whole thing so when we're                                 talking about this what we want to do is                                 think about all of those things in the                                 mental model in terms of how can we how                                 can we create enable or activate                                 capabilities that will help our                                 customers achieve their goal it's not                                 just about what our system is going to                                 do it's about what's going to happen                                 within the environment so what can the                                 product or service due for its users                                 we've got these enormous wheels there's                                 a reason for those as they they go and                                 they do these games and it's part of the                                 engagement of it there's a reason why                                 they're big they're not functionally                                 because it goes faster what can they do                                 for themselves in the context rupal                                 we're talking about function scenes                                 content in the data model essentially                                 what is inherent in Drupal that that it                                 delivers before we start layering on                                 functionality map to the users needs                                 right and it includes the things that                                 are go around it like the governance                                 model and the partnerships and when we                                 talk about community we're not just                                 talking about the technology component                                 but what are the people doing offline                                 were you know in the meat space and what                                 are the regulations that are that are in                                 some ways constraining what we're able                                 to do how we're able to communicate                                 we feel very dearly in health care and                                 then of course one of the most important                                 things is what customers will do for                                 themselves because they want to what                                 this often becomes is a dichotomy or a                                 conflict between what customers want and                                 what the business wants the trick is                                 finding the confluence in the overlap so                                 I don't necessarily want to spend a lot                                 of time talking about the capabilities                                 of the product that we create because I                                 think that you guys all know enough                                 about how to do that you know how to                                 take a requirements document or a                                 creative brief and turn it into a                                 product well what we want to talk about                                 is what users can and will do for                                 themselves and why think about something                                 that a machine could do for you but you                                 choose to do on your own anybody think                                 of things like that just raise your hand                                 can you think of stuff that you could                                 buy it pre-made but you make it yourself                                 like food like you can get food out of a                                 machine to do people here cook you cook                                 okay right is anybody here have a bike                                 okay okay those of you have a bike can                                 you afford a car yes or no some some                                 hand right I don't want to denigrate                                 anybody who can't that's fine but there                                 are reasons why you have these things                                 what are some of the reasons that we                                 might have these these objects or these                                 things do things for ourselves that we                                 don't have to do for ourselves anybody                                 call one out what was it health or                                 health benefits true yes sense of                                 achievement great higher quality and                                 tribal associations okay all right                                 that's not how I would have said it                                 thank you for explaining it tribal                                 associations means something else to me                                 joy right ok so I'll read my list which                                 overlaps I think you know expression of                                 like painting you know you could go and                                 buy art at the posters shop or you could                                 paint your own that's your way of                                 expressing yourself personalization is                                 making it your own right so you could                                 you could get the fish and chips down at                                 the pub and carry out or you can make it                                 your own way with your own spices and                                 things pride sense of achievement i                                 heard challenge cost availability of                                 resources innovation so it doesn't exist                                 the way you want it these are all                                 different things that make us want to do                                 things on our own and it's no easy task                                 to to get from there to deciding what                                 blocks are we going to put on the page                                 but that that is what we do so if we                                 think about a high-rise office building                                 why are there stairs in it well clearly                                 there's a fire code that requires that                                 they're there and it's a redundant                                 design in case the lift is broken but                                 there's also there also faster than                                 waiting for the lift especially if you                                 work on the                                                          which I don't anymore but I have and or                                 perhaps as somebody said earlier you                                 just want to stretch your legs you want                                 to get some exercise so there's a sense                                 of self sufficiency I don't want to rely                                 upon other things I want to be able to                                 do it myself there's also collectivism                                 people coming together to do things for                                 instance in the Amish community raising                                 a barn so the whole village comes                                 together to build a barn now one person                                 could certainly not do this themselves                                 they could of course go and buy one but                                 that's not something that that they do                                 its part of creating and building and                                 energizing the community and his web                                 designers the pool of functions and                                 features                                 often the same i want to talk about                                 social for a moment we've seen with                                 privacy things your google fell foul                                 with buzz last year two years ago was it                                 now but in my own experience with health                                 we build trackers so that people can                                 track for example I've all sort of                                 colitis and I want to track how many                                 good days I've had so I can then have a                                 relationship with or send this                                 information to my doctor I also might                                 want to be involved in a community but                                 do I want them to see how many good days                                 I've had mmm maybe not but maybe I could                                 surface the goal that I set to give the                                 sense of a shared purpose in the                                 community these are these are decisions                                 we have to make on the other hand                                 another project I was involved in London                                 cycle challenge people going out cycling                                 on the weekend yes I done                                               is definitely something that I want to                                 share in the community I want people to                                 see my achievement badge and I want to                                 tweet it out to Twitter subtle                                 distinctions here complex world but but                                 the end game is great if you can build                                 community through the use of these tools                                 and for those of you who may not believe                                 in the value of community in a business                                 context keep in mind that earlier this                                 year Google floated                                                    towards Twitter billion another thing                                 that that people do for themselves is                                 try to change the world right so when we                                 think about what is the confluence                                 between self-sufficiency wanting to do                                 things for yourself and coming together                                 as a community what we have is activism                                 I don't know how many of you are                                 students of the American Civil Rights                                 Movement I'm not sure what the corollary                                 is here in Europe but I like to think                                 how would this have changed with Google+                                 alright to me it's a fascinating                                 experiment just to envision that know                                 who's where what their capabilities are                                 being able to organize on-the-fly                                 respond instantaneously so fascinating                                 mental exercise for me and hopefully for                                 you as well so we talked a moment ago                                 about constraints and how these are a                                 good thing understand the capabilities                                 that exist beyond the the product                                 boundary whether those are real or                                 perceived can both create and destroy                                 constraints we can create constraints                                 that give us clarity and this becomes                                 part of our focus for design efforts and                                 resources we can also eradicate                                 constraints by thinking about what are                                 the alternatives when we think about                                 what people are capable or willing to do                                 for themselves so how to constraints                                 help us when we think about answering                                 this question the first thing we want to                                 do is identify what are the self-imposed                                 constraints I can't do that and get rid                                 of them right because you can you can do                                 it you just may have to think about                                 doing it a different way if if we think                                 about who can think can anyone think of                                 an example of a self-imposed                                 constraining artificial constraint that                                 you've overcome in your own experience                                 anyone self-imposed deadline but will                                 that mean that can be motivating though                                 sometimes what about thinking like there                                 there is no module for that is that a                                 self-imposed constraint has anyone here                                 ever ever contributed to or created a                                 module or a theme yeah okay so you could                                 just as easily have said well there's no                                 theme for that what and that would not                                 have been a great outcome right so I                                 think that hopefully uh hopefully you're                                 getting what I'm saying here if a                                 constraint is not helping you by giving                                 you focus or helping you to identify an                                 alternative go right through it just get                                 around it some way so either identify                                 actively identify an alternative or                                 remove it eradicate that constraint so                                 if we take the example of camera you are                                 trying to reduce the cost of taking                                 photographs the natural assumption                                 would be to reduce the price of the                                 camera or perhaps the film but if you                                 challenge the assumption that there even                                 has to be film then you can eliminate it                                 and you can eliminate major recurring                                 costs then all you have to do is the                                 relatively trivial task of inventing the                                 digital camera right that was                                 straightforward wasn't it so I think                                 we've covered most of this year that the                                 constraints give us focus and the next                                 artificial constraint is that cameras                                 can only take still images so if you're                                 looking at something and you want to see                                 it not moving have you ever had a                                 situation where you thought to yourself                                 gosh I wish I could see that moving like                                 your kid is doing something adorable and                                 sure it'd be great to get the snapshot                                  but really what's adorable about it is                                  how they're stacking things together or                                  how they're playing with the cat does                                  anybody here have kids or cats you must                                  know what I'm talking about right if you                                  have kids and cats you definitely get it                                  so so now you can get a camera that                                  looks like this but takes video does                                  anyone have one okay a couple couples                                  and that's an evolving capability beyond                                  the artificial constraint how many                                  people have a camera and a separate                                  video camera don't be ashamed all right                                  your dinosaurs soon it's going to happen                                  right because when when you're going to                                  be someplace where you're like I only                                  want video unless you're professional                                  videographer it's pretty unlikely so we                                  think about that and then we think about                                  what's another constraint in order to                                  take pictures I need a camera no I don't                                  in my case in order to take good                                  pictures I need a camera because this is                                  a blackberry but you don't you don't                                  need a dedicated camera device in order                                  to take pictures this illuminates one of                                  the unspoken nagging problems of agile                                  that is always additive one of the most                                  important things the designer can do and                                  I think we've we've talked about this a                                  bit and by extension the developer that                                  instantiates the design is to take                                  things away right so take away all those                                  devices by activating the capabilities                                  of other things what this can help us to                                  do is to prioritize so if we introduce                                  certain constraints that give us focus                                  on who we're designing for are we                                  designing a camera for professional                                  photographers or for hobbyists and                                  people who have cats or children or both                                  that gives us an opportunity to really                                  focus our design can we simplify some of                                  the features and functionality maybe                                  reduce the quality of the image but                                  enable things like video or make it so                                  that it's fits into your pocket these                                  are the things that that are really                                  important and this provides the focus                                  which is one of the key attributes of                                  successful systems has anybody here ever                                  heard the concept of flow the                                  psychological concept of flow flow                                  anyone wow you guys are smart all right                                  can anybody hear pronounce the guy's                                  name his name is completely                                  unpronounceable if you want to know it                                  just email me and I'll send it to you I                                  wouldn't even know how to start some                                  sort of Slavic thing with lots of shapes                                  and letters he has this theory about                                  flow being this mental state that you                                  enter where you are completely focused                                  on what you're doing because it's both                                  enjoyable and challenging what is the                                  challenge doing activating your                                  capabilities so here it's activating                                  your capabilities of attention and                                  reflex it would be much easier of course                                  to have a nice big sedan with                                  you know cruise control and and power                                  brakes and steering but I can tell you                                  that this person would not enjoy that as                                  much right part of it part of the thing                                  that makes this process of getting from                                  point A to point B is the journey the                                  flow state that this person is in while                                  they're doing it and it's a way of                                  embracing the constraints of what a                                  motorcycle can do and making them a                                  positive attribute of the design so all                                  these things that we think about when we                                  think about what the idea of constraints                                  and capabilities and systems thinking                                  all of these things if we bring it                                  together enable the concept of idealized                                  design has anyone here ever heard that                                  the the term idealized design                                  before no I stumped you finally ok there                                  there was a professor at the University                                  of Pennsylvania named Ray a cough ack o                                  FF i'll post that on our site to who has                                  advocated idealized design he's written                                  a book about it it's a bit dry but it's                                  a great read because it gives you a                                  vocabulary for understanding the                                  different types of design that you can                                  apply to any sort of problem the first                                  one is to say not my problem who's ever                                  heard that I won't ask you to say who                                  said it but who's ever heard not my                                  problem well only there's anybody here                                  who's not heard that okay just nudge the                                  person next to you if they're know if                                  they're sleeping that's absolution                                  someone else will solve this I'm the                                  developer I can't be bothered with                                  design I'm the designer I can't be                                  bothered with technology there's trash                                  on the sidewalk someone should really                                  pick that up one of the reasons that we                                  culturally a bore laziness is because it                                  represents a failure to make an                                  affirmative change beyond what you're                                  expected to do                                  and instead activating what you're able                                  to do now there might be a Marxist                                  undertone to that we'll talk about that                                  on the break but but the idea is when we                                  talk about well I'll let you say this                                  well the successes of a society depends                                  on people solving problems beyond their                                  assigned role like we saw at the very                                  first slide beyond their own                                  self-interest that's why we applaud                                  grassroots volunteer efforts because                                  they demonstrate the triumph of                                  capabilities over self-imposed                                  constraints to achieve a common goal                                  right and not my job is one of the one                                  of the most insipid self construe impose                                  constraints if you find yourself saying                                  it please check and make sure if there's                                  a way you can get beyond that                                  self-imposed constraint the next the                                  next highest order of dealing with the                                  problem is resolution and it's a common                                  way and the most obvious way to attack a                                  problem is to deal with the symptoms but                                  focusing on the symptoms only neglects                                  an opportunity to address the underlying                                  cause so in here we but the problem is                                  how do we ride a scooter in the rain and                                  so that the answer they've come up with                                  is to carry an umbrella but maybe riding                                  the bus would have been a better better                                  idea as we eliminate the constraint that                                  says oh we have to do it on a scooter we                                  can propose then that the customer might                                  buy a car if they have the money or go                                  on the bus so we're not only solving the                                  immediate problem but making it                                  impossible for the problem to read                                  reoccur right which brings us to the                                  next level which is kind of a root cause                                  thing which is solution what many                                  designers strive for is the opportunity                                  to understand the cause of a problem and                                  address it before the problem can                                  manifest so this this requires an                                  understanding of how a product or a                                  service is used and we've talked about                                  ways to understand this through research                                  through the ethnography studies we might                                  have a study of reported defects and                                  some creative problem solving and how to                                  avoid recurring situations the                                  investment is worth it if you look at it                                  in terms of differentiating from                                  competitors or delivering a more                                  efficient operation you've got your                                  bottom line at stake here                                  so if we take a look at this railroad                                  crossing its we can definitely                                  understand how there might be the                                  possibility of a collision occurring                                  there's no no blinking lights there's no                                  gate that will come down and we could                                  put those things in there and and treat                                  the symptoms but is there a better                                  solution can anyone think of one yes a                                  bridge right what if the what if the                                  tracks and the road did not have to                                  intersect if there was some way to do                                  that so looking at the root cause that                                  these two pathways intersect in an                                  uncontrolled manner and then addressing                                  that and many of us feel or many of us                                  have not experienced a higher order of                                  problem-solving then solution so                                  absolution resolution is treating the                                  symptoms solution is going to root cause                                  dissolution is the highest order way of                                  doing it and this is thinking about how                                  can we change the entire system what if                                  we were to create a society in which                                  there were no cars then we'd never have                                  to worry about trains and cars colliding                                  so it this requires pulling the camera                                  back and looking at the larger seen not                                  just looking as a railway operator at ok                                  I'll elevate my tracks at this point but                                  thinking about how can I create a                                  railway system within the city that                                  never crosses a road that never                                  encounters this this but still meets the                                  needs of people is there it is there a                                  different way and looking and addressing                                  it systemically in web development I                                  just wanted to talk about agile how many                                  of you are working within agile                                  about half I've spent last year working                                  in agile and it's a UX person it's very                                  difficult because I found I was always a                                  sprint ahead of the developers the                                  developers would put in time based on                                  the things they had to deliver and they                                  would say sorry I've got no time to                                  think about these sort of holistic                                  system wide sort of things that you're                                  thinking about I wanted to solve the                                  problem once so then the user doesn't                                  have to really address the same problem                                  in different ways but I couldn't get                                  their time and this is common with user                                  experience so but I like the idea of                                  agile there are problems with thinking                                  about it in a waterfall way up front and                                  trying to specify the whole system                                  produce lots of documentation that                                  immediately goes out of date no it can't                                  be that way but we have to reconcile                                  these two I'm calling out to you because                                  you need to help we need to do this                                  together we need to build an agile way                                  but we need to be able to thank system                                  wide as we go maybe it's as simple as                                  just building in time in a sprint to                                  consider something I know it's always                                  very tight you've got to deliver                                  something as well but this is the way it                                  has to be and one of the other things                                  that we're talking about and the graphic                                  here you probably can't see the line                                  this is a set piece right so the corner                                  kick is that you can operate within the                                  flow of the game and and try to do the                                  best that you can but when you have some                                  guiding principles when you have some                                  ways that you know that you want to try                                  to achieve your end goal in the larger                                  context it gives you the capability to                                  work with in an agile framework so that                                  understanding as some of you as                                  developers as designers how to work                                  together within a sprint but with a                                  systems view thinking about things like                                  constraints and capabilities simplicity                                  efficiency focus when we think about                                  those concepts in everything we do and                                  apply them as guiding principles then                                  we're doing a better job of idealized                                  design                                  we're not thinking about some                                  pie-in-the-sky notion that well maybe in                                  phase four point seven we'll get around                                  to that and the budget never comes does                                  anybody here believe in phase for                                  anybody I didn't think so you're all too                                  smart for that so what we have to do                                  instead is we have to focus on the                                  near-term win but not disable the                                  long-term achievements so using these                                  principles that we've been giving you                                  are meant to enable you to do that to                                  achieve idealized design within short                                  term bursts because you have an                                  understanding of how to how to think                                  about the system and the activate the                                  external capabilities and energize your                                  users and respect what it is that they                                  want to do for themselves if you think                                  about something like a marathon there's                                  no perfect run no matter what you do                                  whether you win or not someday some                                  young buck is going to come along and do                                  it faster but that doesn't mean that you                                  shouldn't try your best right it doesn't                                  mean that you can't do something great                                  the tool these the tools that we've                                  given you today are meant to help you                                  win each marathon that you run even                                  though they're called sprints they ever                                  feel like a marathon sort of like                                  getting through this presentation                                  without the slides cutting out so we're                                  back okay so you may not come close you                                  may come close to perfection you may                                  never achieve it it's like a vacuum                                  something like that but you can                                  certainly get a lot closer than you                                  would if you just focused on the near                                  term and focused on the symptoms and                                  focus only within the boundary of your                                  system and the technology that you had                                  so that's that's really the lesson for                                  today is thinking about the constraints                                  letting them give you focus focusing on                                  the capabilities of people outside and                                  using them to achieve these goals that's                                  it okay ready                                  thank you so we've we've got a couple of                                  minutes again if you want to tweet about                                  us we hope you will sis think are there                                  any questions questions anyone yes in                                  the back you have to speak into the                                  microphone because they're taping it I                                  maybe went over the side a little bit                                  late from a buff but you spoke about                                  doing research from users and what they                                  say they want or how they express you                                  know their their goals maybe do                                  observational you know some type of                                  different research methods what people                                  say they want and what they what they                                  actually do ends up being different I                                  mean how do you differentiate between                                  those two things okay that's a much                                  bigger question to answer i'll give you                                  the short version is i don't ask them i                                  put them in situations and watch them                                  and I try to make those situations as                                  realistic as possible most of what I do                                  these days is I do activity oriented                                  research so if you want to stick around                                  for a few minutes I'll fill your ear                                  until your head explodes but that's                                  basically the idea is there are certain                                  things you can trust people and ask them                                  you can ask a commercial airline pilot                                  whether he would like to have the                                  altimeter here or there and he will give                                  you an honest and trustworthy answer                                  because it is his profession and he's                                  trained in that skill and he has                                  thousands of hours of time invested in                                  it as a parent of a teenager can you ask                                  a teenager anything and get a straight                                  answer no I know this so you haven't you                                  have to know what kind of research                                  you're doing when you're talking about                                  people who are casual users of things                                  people in social networks or people who                                  intermittently use systems you can ask                                  them things and be like yeah yeah I'd                                  use that sure I would go to a bank that                                  offered foot rubs like but would they                                  really you know it sounds great you go                                  to the bank and get your feet rubbed but                                  nobody when they go to the bank they                                  don't have time for that they need to                                  get on to the next thing they're they're                                  on their lunch hour or whatever it is                                  and maybe the guy at the bank kind of                                  looks a little weird you don't want his                                  hands on your feet I don't even know why                                  I'm talking about this but you have to                                  understand what kind of things what kind                                  of questions you                                  asking what kind of audience you're                                  observing okays answer your question                                  anybody else I'm just thinking in terms                                  of constraints and capabilities the                                  point of view that with Drupal you know                                  you'd often think almost everything is                                  possible given sufficient amount of time                                  whether and add resources so the                                  constraints very often in a Drupal                                  project budgetary and so I'm just                                  wondering whether you can give us any                                  examples of how that constraint can be                                  positive in any way because it's                                  sometimes difficult to see how it could                                  be I can answer this well I think that                                  comes down to the prioritization process                                  so we've built our mental model we                                  understand what's most important to the                                  users we've also we've got a business                                  here who's got some needs has got to                                  deliver something we match those two                                  together and we often collaboratively                                  with the client because the client has                                  clear ideas about what they want come up                                  with a scope and and at that point we                                  have to all agree and it's it's got to                                  be you know it's goes without saying we                                  can't have everything we already know                                  the scope of what they would want I                                  don't know let me get any give an answer                                  that's a little closer to home and it's                                  I'm somewhat fictionalizing here to                                  protect the innocent suppose you work                                  for a company that creates diabetes                                  medications and the audiences for that                                  there are physicians who treat diabetic                                  patients and there's many of them there                                  are diabetic patients themselves and                                  there's many of those then there's a                                  smaller group and a very focus group                                  dietitians or diabetes educators people                                  who are not doctors what are educated in                                  ways to help diabetic patients control                                  their diet in such a way that they don't                                  make their disease worse if we have a                                  small budget on a project from our                                  diabetes manufacturing client we might                                  say well we can do something and you                                  know maybe move the needle so much if we                                  go after one of those large audiences                                  or we can go after this small audience                                  really focus on them so that same                                         pounds or whatever it is that we would                                  spend doing doing something sort of                                  ineffectual and you know half good quit                                  with the physicians we can really focus                                  on this audience and maybe go to the                                  conference of diabetes educators and                                  augment it through an offline thing and                                  then an online channel that are                                  integrated now we're doing a system-wide                                  idealized solution on a narrow audience                                  now will your clients say yes to that                                  that I can't promise you but it but it                                  gives you a framework for saying I can                                  either use constraints that diminish the                                  quality of my project or I can apply                                  those same constraints in such a way                                  that I can do the better project right                                  does that answer your question ok do we                                  have time for one more one more anyone                                  no all right well thank you very much
