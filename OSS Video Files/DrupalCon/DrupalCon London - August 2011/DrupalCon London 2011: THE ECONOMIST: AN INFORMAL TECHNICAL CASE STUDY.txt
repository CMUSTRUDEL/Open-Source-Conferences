For people interested in big websites and their unique challenges, this panel offers a behind the scenes look at The Economist site. A team of experienced Economist developers will talk about the complicated challenges, the innovative solutions, and the still-to-be-solved issues of this popular website. There will also be a (lively, no doubt) Q&A.

The presentation aspect of this session will focus on workflow challenges, testing, performance issues, necessary custom-coded solutions, and 3rd party integration.

Note: There will be at least four team members on this panel.
