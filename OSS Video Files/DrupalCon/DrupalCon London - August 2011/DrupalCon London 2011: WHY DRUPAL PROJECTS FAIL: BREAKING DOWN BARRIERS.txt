	Presented by

Drupal is a flexible, feature rich web application platform that many thriving companies leverage as their cornerstone technology. Why, then, do some companies fail horribly when adopting Drupal? Are you having trouble meeting deadlines? Are your developers pounding their keyboards claiming that Drupal is garbage? Are your project managers running for the hills? If so, this session will identify common barriers that companies experience when first adopting Drupal and provide solutions on how to overcome them.

As a member of Acquia's Professional Services team, I have taught at Princeton, worked on Wall Street, and helped to secure our homeland. Having seen a wide range of Drupal projects has given me a unique perspective on why certain projects fail. There are common patterns, both technical and not, that contribute to the success of a project. By discussing the pitfalls and solutions that other companies experience, this session will help kick-start your organization towards Drupal success.

Intended audience
This presentation is intended for business owners, project managers, technical leads / architects, and sales managers. There will be little technical discussion other than high level concepts, as most of the reasons why Drupal projects fail have little to do with the low level technology.

Questions answered by this session
Why are my Drupal projects failing when so many other organizations are having success?

What are the common barriers that other companies are experiencing?

How have other organizations broken through those barriers?

How can I set my project up for success?

What can I do to set my development / design up for success with Drupal?

not going                               to be getting into things like you know                               you have to configure varnish for                               authenticated users otherwise your                               performance will blow up this is this is                               more geared towards best practices in                               terms of process I'll get a little bit                                technical in some areas so that there's                                at least some discussion in terms of                                what can be done to avoid common                                pitfalls and then we can reserve for                                some of the technical stuff for the Q&A                                after so just to go over the agenda you                                know we're gonna start off with a brief                                introduction of myself so that you can                                get a sense for Who I am why I'm giving                                this talk will also talk about some of                                the key components to success                                so we'll actually start off positive you                                know I want to make the title                                provocative to be negative but we're                                gonna be positive so and then we'll go                                over some of the the real real use cases                                in terms of why they fail so some of the                                common things that people are                                encountering some of the red flags that                                I've heard and then will actually talk                                about you know what what can we do to                                overcome these barriers so real-world                                actionable items that we can use to seem                                to get through and to have successful                                Drupal projects and then we'll take                                questions so you know it is late in the                                day I really appreciate you guys all                                being here try to move this along so                                that we're not stuck here too late so                                just a little bit about me my name is                                Chris Plagueis you can find me see                                Plagueis on drupal.org it's a funny                                Greek spelling but that's how you say my                                name I answer everything so don't worry                                about it I'm also the same handle on                                Twitter pretty consistent so if you want                                to find me I'm pretty easy to find I                                can't hide I'm a Drupal module                                maintainer I have about                                                 so which is a modest number not too much                                but it's a pretty good amount I'm also a                                core contributor very minor but I have a                                few core patches in there I'm also a Zen                                certified some Zen certified PHP                                  engineer I'm a MySQL certified developer                                an administrator and I'm also linux                                professional institute certified so i                                have some experience in pretty much all                                areas of the lamps                                I've been working with Drupal for a                                little over three years it's probably                                about three and a half last time I                                checked it was around that time so                                that's not an excessive amount in the                                Drupal community but if you ask my wife                                she'll attest for how many hours I spent                                behind the behind the computer also I'm                                a member of I was a member of aqueous                                Professional Services team for a little                                over a year and I'll talk more about                                that and why that's relevant and right                                now I am a Solutions Architect on the                                pre sales team for Acquia so I talked a                                lot about help sell Drupal and explain                                why Drupal is a good solution and can                                fit the business needs of our various                                customers so that's a little bit about                                me but you know what makes me qualified                                why am i standing up here you know                                talking to you and I think the first                                aspect is that I work with a lot of                                organizations so as a member of                                professional services team what my job                                was to do is to go around to various                                clients work alongside them and talk to                                them about how to make their their                                project succeed with Drupal so it was a                                lot of architecture work it was a lot of                                training and then some implementation                                and then some site audits on the backend                                so performance audits security audits                                that sort of thing so you know I got a                                pretty good overview of what it takes to                                make project succeed I also saw why our                                people were falling down I'd kind of                                stay with tongue-in-cheek that I worked                                on Wall Street I taught at Princeton and                                I helped secure our homeland it sounds a                                lot cooler than it is but you know just                                some various different aspects of Drupal                                 also you know I remember learning Drupal                                 so this is a this is a little                                 illustration of me learning Drupal you                                 know truth be told I absolutely hated                                 Drupal for about four months                                 I really my goal was to eradicate Drupal                                 from the company that I work for my wife                                 remembers me just just absolutely hating                                 it and there was a barrier there and you                                 know the thing is I'm not alone this                                 illustration is one of my favorite ones                                 I don't know who offered it but it's                                 great                                 it shows the learning curve of Drupal                                 and you can see we lost a few people                                 along the way so it's good to know that                                 I'm not alone here                                 also I saw a lot of resurrections right                                 so I work for a company where one of the                                 offerings was a rescue of Drupal                                 products which is a very very difficult                                 business and a tough business model if                                 you've ever gotten into it so but it was                                 it was pretty interesting for me because                                 I get to see where where some others                                 kind of fell ill or fell down and and                                 you know saw where they they ran into                                 the same issues so you know I've been in                                 the weeds so I've been you know an                                 implementer I started off as an engineer                                 you know really got my start in Drupal                                 as you know contributing with with                                 modules kind of messing around there and                                 I've also seen the big picture so you                                 know I moved on to more of a role where                                 where I'm looking at it from the                                 business goals and as opposed to you                                 know what it's actually going to                                 technically take to get a project done                                 so there's a wide range of experience                                 there and what I found is that there are                                 patterns so you know what I wanted to do                                 with this presentation was really share                                 the patterns that that I've seen and                                 then open up for discussion so we can                                 you know have more of a dialogue and                                 questions and you know see what you guys                                 are experiencing and how we might be                                 able to to work through those problems                                 so I think you know the big thing for me                                 is that there are there are really five                                 key components to success so these are                                 the things that seem to be common to all                                 the projects that are doing really well                                 and that's that's project management so                                 having strong project managers is really                                 really key to make projects successful                                 process we'll talk a little bit about                                 process but you know something that that                                 works and something that's well-defined                                 is always present in Drupal applications                                 that succeed development practices this                                 means that you know how are your                                 developers interacting with each other                                 how are they actually building this                                 stuff you know what are they doing to                                 facilitate the application development                                 and you know that's always present as                                 well thought partnership is one that I                                 think often gets overlooked sometimes as                                 Drupal developers or if we're                                 implementing a product internally we                                 take requirements and we try to                                 implement them                                 you know thought partnership is                                 something that we'll talk a lot about                                 going forward but that's something                                 that's a key factor in in shaping the                                 discussions and really determining the                                 outcome of the project and then                                 expertise this may seem obvious but you                                 know we'll talk about where a lack of                                 expertise might get you into trouble and                                 how you can go forward and gain the                                 expertise inside of your organization so                                 I guess you know these these key                                 components what we're really talking                                 about here is expectation management                                 communication and execution if we have                                 those five key components then these                                 things will fall in place and if these                                 things fall in place                                 it really doesn't matter what                                 technologies you use but for a Drupal                                 you know it's critical that you have                                 these in order to be successful so let's                                 go through some of the barriers and                                 these are the common barriers you know                                 of course they're gonna be more but                                 these are really the big ones that                                 prevent people from succeeding so you                                 know when I go on site you know the                                 first thing that I do is is I listen a                                 pretty pretty hardcore I mean now that's                                 what I'm there the first day is me                                 asking questions and just listening I                                 mean these are some of the red flags                                 that I always listen for the first thing                                 is we use you know company X Drupal so                                 this is something where an organization                                 you know has their own slew of modules                                 or their own little platform or                                 something that they build on top of and                                 you know this works in some cases but in                                 most cases it actually doesn't I'm                                 another thing that I listened for is we                                 do the impossible if I hear those words                                 then you know the red flag goes up                                 because there's some there's some                                 interesting implications of that and                                 then a lot of times I hear you know we                                 have a really good PHP developers and                                 and they just need a couple days to get                                 up to speed with Drupal if you have this                                 mindset then there's there some pretty                                 big issues with that as you saw with                                 with my experience with learning Drupal                                 one other thing that I listened for is                                 you know we're pushing boundaries so we                                 don't work with the community you know                                 we have a lot of IP intellectual                                 property that we don't want to give away                                 so you know we're gonna do this this is                                 our value and and this is where we this                                 is a you know how we're gonna make our                                 money and how we're going to be                                 successful also you know one thing that                                 that kind of raises red flags sometimes                                 it works sometimes it doesn't but you                                 know we have an offshore                                 do most of our development and we'll                                 talk about why that works why that                                 doesn't work also you know I think two                                 big things is you know we cut our rates                                 to get a project we hear it and we see a                                 lot about you know there's the carrot                                 and stick approach where somebody                                 dangles a million web properties for you                                 if you kind of get this project out and                                 get it working and it kind of you know                                 it in tandem with that we will get                                 bigger projects if we meet the                                 aggressive timeline so these are the                                 things these are the you know some of                                 the red flags that I listen for and it                                 really makes my my ears get pointed so                                 you know let's let's break it down let's                                 talk about why these things are are                                 problematic and I think you know the the                                 first piece is mismanaged expectations                                 and if you're gonna leave with one thing                                 you know leave with this no matter the                                 end result a project will be viewed as a                                 failure if the original expectations                                 were not met most projects fail not                                 because of technology but because of the                                 management of expectations and and this                                 is absolutely critical you know and I                                 think some contributing factors to                                 expectation mismanagement is is product                                 misrepresentation so that might be                                 accidental or it might be intentional an                                 example of where it might be accidental                                 is let's say you have you know a young                                 sales staff that's coming on board you                                 know they're really aggressive they want                                 to get the sale across and they might                                 not fully understand the technology and                                 what they say might have you know                                 implement eight implementation                                 implications beyond what they intended                                 you know there's this also happens and                                 how we talk about Drupal I'm probably                                 the biggest Drupal apologist and I'm                                 guilty of this more than anybody but                                 what I always say is you know there's a                                 module for that and that's not really                                 the whole story you know what you really                                 should be saying is you know there's                                 there's a contributed solution that we                                 could leverage and then you know explain                                 the risks but that's that's an example                                 of accidental product misrepresentation                                 and then there's the intentional stuff                                 and you know this actually happens where                                 you know someone will say something that                                 isn't really true in order to get a deal                                 and unfortunately we see this you know                                 it happens in business it's it's a way                                 of life but this is a this is a huge                                 factor you know this is where projects                                 get lost as soon as the phone is picked                                 up unsustainable precedents we talked a                                 little bit a bit a bit about this and                                 the red flags but you know if you do                                 that first project                                 and you agree to a really aggressive                                 timeline and you agree to do it for                                 really low cost that's something where                                 that precedence has been set right that                                 Pandora's Box has been open it's really                                 hard to close it so oftentimes you know                                 you get into a situation where you know                                 those client expectations during the                                 next project are sky-high and they're                                 really unattainable they're unreasonable                                 and they're not profitable for you                                 communication breakdown may seem obvious                                 but you know I think there's seen a lot                                 of instances where people develop Drupal                                 applications and then they kind of go in                                 a corner and they get really excited                                 about it and they don't communicate with                                 a client what the progress is and what                                 they're doing and then they show it back                                 and that expectation is mismatched and                                 that's a big problem you know despite                                 what work was done or how well it was                                 done if that communication isn't there                                 then that's that's a huge problem and I                                 think you know an open source people are                                 expecting transparency I think the old                                 way of business was to be really closed                                 but you know as you see what Drupal con                                 people are sharing a lot of information                                 you know I think you know being                                 transparent is something that's uh                                 that's really important but you know a                                 lot of companies it's hard it's not it's                                 not there it's really not second nature                                 to them it takes some effort and then                                 you know so one thing that's really                                 problematic is when the client or                                 stakeholder is driving the project                                 that's a big problem and that's really                                 where expectations get mismatched as                                 well and this sounds funny coming from                                 an American talking about exit strategy                                 but you have to develop an exit strategy                                 all right so you know this means what                                 are you going to do when the application                                 is built we don't think about that then                                 those expectations are you know                                 something brakes well who is going to                                 fix it do they have to pay for it what's                                 what's the structure so that's a you                                 know I think that's something that that                                 is often overlooked when when we're                                 developing these projects so one thing                                 to go on as well as lack of expertise                                 so this is really prevalent and people                                 new to Drupal and this is really Drupal                                 specific and that Drupal is very very                                 complex right so you can have very                                 technical people                                 I actually got all my certifications and                                 stuff before going in Drupal so you know                                 I had a I had a boosted ego of myself my                                 capabilities but when I went to Drupal I                                 didn't fully understand the complexity                                 and I thought the code was garbage I                                 thought it was trash I thought it was                                 not well thought out but you know I                                 think the big thing is that I just                                 didn't understand the problems there are                                 strengths and challenges of Drupal same                                 with any platform there's no perfect                                 solution and you really you don't know                                 what you don't know so going into a                                 project for the first time it's very                                 very difficult to know where this                                 roadblocks are going to be and where the                                 challenges are you know Drupal is not a                                 magic bullet I think sometimes during                                 the sales process we might say that it                                 is or we might allude to the fact that                                 it is you know Drupal is gonna solve all                                 your problems it's free it's better than                                 everything that else that's out there                                 and again this goes back to expectation                                 management but you know that's not the                                 case it takes work and it's I truly                                 believe that Drupal is the best solution                                 out there for for content management web                                 experience but there there are still                                 challenges and it's important to note                                 that the problems aren't trivial so                                 these are complex problems and they're                                 trying to be solved by by very smart                                 people so you know it's it's often the                                 case that something's been running too                                 many times before and it's just it just                                 doesn't have a good solution yet that                                 that's been integrated back in the                                 platform so experience is knowing where                                 these are what am I going to run into                                 because the problem with Drupal is that                                 there's many ways to accomplish the same                                 goal this is also a strength right you                                 could have the same module you could                                 have a different you know a totally                                 different module do the same goal                                 accomplish the same thing which one do                                 you take where the roadblocks and you                                 know I think it's important to note that                                 that your team can actually add hundreds                                 of hours unknowingly                                 so we actually see this a lot with                                 designers not to pick on designers but a                                 lot of times people who are new to                                 Drupal will add functionality right I                                 think designers are very creative I'm                                 not a designer                                 I respect the creativity that people put                                 in but what ends up happening is that it                                 the focus is on the the design and the                                 creativity and there's not a lot of                                 conversation about how that that mixes                                 with Drupal                                 and this is really a drupal specific one                                 because the theme layer is so decoupled                                 from the functionality layer which is                                 good in many ways but what often happens                                 is that a design will be done outside of                                 Drupal with no consideration in terms of                                 you know how Drupal works and then you                                 know once the functionality is complete                                 the design will be plopped on top of                                 Drupal and tried to make into a theme                                 and that's really difficult for the for                                 a first rupal project and you know we'll                                 talk about how we can combat that going                                 forward and also with with developers                                 and I did this a lot is that you try to                                 reinvent the wheel if it's not apparent                                 how to do it in Drupal at first my first                                 inclination was to code right I love                                 coding you know I have a saying I love                                 coding that's why I don't do it for a                                 work but I was really really interested                                 in coding and learning so I was                                 reinventing the wheel a lot and that                                 added a lot of hours to a project that                                 didn't need to be there another thing                                 that we encounter is that people build                                 platforms too early right so their first                                 rupal project or their second Drupal                                 project what they come in and they say                                 yeah we have we have our own version of                                 Drupal right we may or may not have                                 hacked core which means changing the                                 core code which is which is generally a                                 bad idea unless you really really know                                 what you're doing but you know the                                 problem is that you really need deep                                 expertise in order to build a repeatable                                 solution again with Drupal there's                                 there's a lot of flexibility and promise                                 in terms of multi-site in terms of                                 distributions in terms of installation                                 profiles that are custom to your                                 organization but if you don't have the                                 use case and you don't have the                                 expertise in terms of what it takes to                                 make these succeed then it's going to be                                 very very difficult to go forward what                                 often happens is that a distribution                                 will be made up front it will satisfy                                 the first site that would be great and                                 then the second site rolls around ok                                 this doesn't really fit you know we've                                 sometimes elapsed the requirements have                                 changed you know what                                 now you're reinventing the wheel so                                 you're really blocking innovation I                                 think you know the power with Drupal is                                 the value of innovation so all the                                 contributions that are coming in through                                 the community but if you kind of lock                                 yourself into this this platform idea                                 too early without understanding the                                 problems then you really block that                                 innovation and that's you know that's                                 that's a great recipe for for failure                                 you know if you do have enough use cases                                 yeah that's that's great like a platform                                 is great if you look at the existing                                 ones that are                                 they're you know open atrium that was                                 built from many projects hadn't pulled                                 great experiences from the development C                                 team if you look at phase two and their                                 distributions those are all built from                                 from projects that they've had so                                 there's a lot of expertise there as well                                 and there's use cases to make those                                 happen I mean it's also important to                                 note you know what are your business                                 goals it's it's very tough to make money                                 off of a distribution unless you know                                 you have solid business goals around how                                 you're going to monetize that so you                                 know even though it might technically                                 make sense or be the option that                                 presents itself in order to reduce                                 deployed development and deployment that                                 sort of stuff you know it might be good                                 to take a second look at that because                                 you know it doesn't always align with                                 with the business goals of what you're                                 trying to do so let's talk a little bit                                 about solutions all right let's talk                                 about how we can combat some of these                                 things so the first we'll talk about                                 we'll talk about project management and                                 again you know this is really the key                                 member of the team I'm really big on                                 this the project managers if there's a                                 good project manager then they can /                                 they can they can overtake some of the                                 other bad practices that are there a                                 good project manager can really Drive a                                 project to success and that's key you                                 know I hear a lot from people that oh we                                 became successful because we eliminated                                 the project manager role well maybe you                                 just eliminated you know the problem may                                 be the project manager wasn't                                 necessarily the right solution or the                                 right fit in that instance but that's                                 more or less a band-aid as you get                                 projects that scale the project managers                                 become increasingly more critical and                                 they're really the focal point towards                                 towards success and the reason you know                                 they they have to be let's actually go                                 for some characteristics they have to be                                 knowledgeable about the technology it's                                 really tough to be a great project                                 manager and not understand basically                                 what Drupal is or what the technology is                                 that you're building on top of you know                                 I've seen a lot of good project managers                                 fail because they didn't understand the                                 technology and that's you know not a                                 fault to them they're probably brought                                 into a situation that wasn't the best                                 fit but if you are a project manager                                 it's very very important that you at                                 least have a good understanding of how                                 Drupal works and what what it takes to                                 actually                                 to Drupal site not on the sense of you                                 know you have to be able to code a                                 module but maybe no the most important                                 modules and know the basic solutions                                 Drupal is very friendly towards that you                                 can be a site builder you don't have to                                 be a developer in order to get started                                 so it really is a good tool that you can                                 kind of dive into and learn going                                 forward you know the another key                                 characteristic of a good project manager                                 is that they understand process so we'll                                 talk about process in a little bit but                                 it's it's a cornerstone towards                                 facilitating communication and combating                                 a lot of those things that we talked                                 about earlier and it's critical that                                 again the project manager is the person                                 that really drives process because                                 internally they keep their team on track                                 right they're hard asses I mean they're                                 the developers might not like them all                                 the time but they you know they're the                                 guys that say my projects don't go over                                 budget you know what what do you need                                 for me in order for you know you break                                 down these barriers they need to be                                 really aggressive internally but                                 conversely externally they really need                                 to protect the team so these are the                                 people that you know are taking the the                                 bullets in front line these are the                                 people that are taking all the stuff                                 from the customer all the grief when                                 things don't go right you know it's                                 really important that they have that                                 dichotomy and you know another great                                 characteristic is is that a good project                                 manager effectively pushes back saying                                 no is is much more important than saying                                 yes you know I think a lot of times we                                 get feedback well you know the customer                                 is paying the bill or this is you know                                 live that kundra and you know we can't                                 say no to him well that's that's not the                                 case I think people you know are looking                                 for you to say no if it doesn't make                                 sense towards what they're trying to do                                 so it's really really important that                                 that project managers pushed back and                                 and don't just you know take everything                                 in and move forward without so let's go                                 back to expectation management we talked                                 about you know if there's one thing that                                 we want to we want to get out of this is                                 that you know expectation is key and                                 project succeeding so I've lost my I'm                                 sorry what I meant to say is that what                                 they're really doing is with all these                                 things they're managing expectations                                 right so if you have good process if you                                 have good communication if you're                                 effectively pushing back then you're                                 managing the expectations and that's you                                 know that that's where the project                                 manager is                                 key so let's talk a little bit about                                 process you know I don't want to get                                 into too detail but you know I kind of                                 want to leave this for the questions and                                 the conversations because this is this                                 is really important again the project                                 manager drives the process but you know                                 honestly the methodology doesn't matter                                 I think a lot of times we get into these                                 holy wars in terms of you know agile                                 versus waterfall that sort of stuff but                                 you know I think if I forget who it was                                 but I think it was Seth the project                                 manager from Lola bada's listening to a                                 podcast and he says it's really hard to                                 sell agile and what they have to do is                                 they have to start off with waterfall                                 and then once the trust gets in then                                 they can move into agile so just briefly                                 you know what the difference is is a                                 waterfall method is kind of like an                                 incremental incremental steps right so                                 you have a milestone so you know                                 milestone one is that you'll have blogs                                 and wiki's done milestone two is that                                 you'll have community features you know                                 the if that works for you then it works                                 for you and that's fine the problem with                                 that is that it's based on a huge                                 assumption that everything works before                                 moving on to the next step and agile is                                 more of an iterative approach in which                                 you know you have things in a backlog                                 you do a certain amount of work and then                                 you can revisit things that that don't                                 necessarily make it in so it really                                 forces you to prioritize and get the                                 important things done where you can                                 maintain a backlog of less important                                 tasks and and kind of move those into                                 future iterations as necessary you know                                 but again it really doesn't matter just                                 as long as everybody is on the same page                                 and long as everybody's following it so                                 it has to be very well-defined and it                                 also has to be flexible at the same time                                 so that's a bit of a contradiction but                                 it just has to be transparent right so                                 it really it really has to be something                                 that your development team can do and it                                 also has to be flexible enough to meet                                 any challenges that come up if something                                 you know breaks the process you know it                                 was a part of an organization that was                                 really focused on process and the                                 problem is that we stuck to it too much                                 right we stuck to it where it didn't                                 really make sense and that caused                                 problems we said you know this isn't in                                 the process and then we you know kind of                                 cut off our nose to spite our face so                                 you know it's very important that that                                 flexibility is there and simple is key I                                 think with everything I think we know we                                 see a lot of organization                                 that do things like invest in very                                 expensive project management software                                 which may or may not be a good thing but                                 then there's that learning curve and                                 your development team has to go to it if                                 the redevelopment team's resisting it                                 that's a problem you know for example                                 there was a Drupal Commons podcast                                 recently as an aqueous podcast and one                                 of the I forget who said it but somebody                                 alluded to the fact that you know when                                 we're working with with partners on                                 Commons when we do these joint                                 engagements we have a Google spreadsheet                                 as a bug tracking system and somebody                                 tweeted this and was like what what do                                 you what this is crazy but you know we                                 use other tools for other projects but                                 you know in this case granting access to                                 various things and learning getting                                 people learned on on all these different                                 tools that we use internally wasn't the                                 best case using a Google spreadsheet was                                 really easy people could jump in they                                 saw what was broken you know what needed                                 to be fixed was it elegant probably not                                 but they could really easily say yeah                                 this is fixed or add another bug and it                                 was done in a way that you know we can                                 read it so again you know that's that's                                 not really a slick solution but it's                                 something that everybody could rally                                 around and everybody liked and they                                 found very easy very simple you know in                                 that case that's a process that works                                 where where people might think that it                                 wouldn't otherwise so we'll talk a                                 little bit about development practices                                 try not to get too technical here but                                 you know I think the big thing is that                                 you have to use source control whether                                 it's a small project or whether it's you                                 know the largest project you know you                                 have to make sure that that you're                                 facilitating that it's it's really                                 important that your team uses it because                                 it prevents you know it keeps it it                                 keeps a transparent log internally of                                 what's done it shows you who's changing                                 stuff you know it also prevents                                 conflicts that sort of thing it just                                 adds a lot of automated communication to                                 the process so people have a nice log of                                 what's going on and again you know it                                 facilitates communication so because you                                 have this log and because you have                                 access to see what's changed you know                                 your developers will actually talk to                                 one another source control isn't meant                                 to                                 an automated project manager what it's                                 meant to do is it's meant to facilitate                                 and foster communication it's meant for                                 one developer to walk down the hall and                                 go to the other developer and say why                                 did you do this or you know what was                                 changed you know it's really meant for                                 that type of interaction you know in                                 terms of Drupal best practices are out                                 there I think a lot of times developers                                 designers resist this so you know we                                 talked a little bit about you know how a                                 designer might theme something and then                                 try to plop it on top of Drupal this                                 this doesn't really work this is really                                 really difficult to do in terms of best                                 practices for Drupal there are a lot of                                 starter themes that you can use and you                                 can kind of build up on top of that you                                 know by doing this so it'll do things                                 that are behind the scenes it might not                                 be a parent at first but it'll do things                                 like you know it'll maintain the                                 semantic markup which gives you better                                 SEO which Drupal is really good at it                                 also allows you to swap out a theme in                                 order to facilitate redesigns that sort                                 of thing when you start from scratch and                                 you don't have knowledge of how the                                 Drupal theming system works on a really                                 really deep level then a lot of times                                 you're omitting things that that Drupal                                 expects to be there you know and I think                                 also with developers the biggest thing                                 is the biggest thing that I've seen is                                 coding standards right so coding                                 standards are a way you know they don't                                 affect the functionality of the code but                                 they're kind of like a structured way of                                 writing this stuff so that people can                                 read it in a consistent manner and                                 actually when I do site audits the first                                 thing that I do is I installed a coder                                 module and look for where coding                                 standards aren't adhered to and that                                 sounds weird because it doesn't affect                                 the functionality but what it means is                                 that it kind of points to code where                                 someone didn't research the api's or if                                 someone's kind of new to Drupal or you                                 know someone was kind of going it going                                 it alone and not using best practices or                                 what's recommended in the community it's                                 it's a great way to identify where code                                 might be problematic and again you know                                 the more that you're working with best                                 practices the more that that your                                 developers will actually understand what                                 it takes to build a Drupal site and                                 we'll go across documentation I'll have                                 to                                 documentation security practices you                                 know the theming practices just best                                 practices in general and it's important                                 to note too that these things are                                 publicly available you know a lot of                                 times we hear well you know there's                                 Drupal coding standards or there's these                                 security functions that you can use to                                 prevent you know sequel injection or                                 cross-site scripting and a lot of times                                 it's like well that you know where where                                 is that you know is there some secret                                 thing that often can provide it no it's                                 it's out there it's publicly available                                 on drupal.org so if you search for                                 coding standards you know you'll                                 actually see this on the the drupal                                 documentation page and it's important                                 that that your developers are familiar                                 with this and again you know simple is                                 better this is a reoccurring theme the                                 more complex you know the more complex a                                 process the more problematic it becomes                                 if we keep it simple and we we make sure                                 that people have access to source                                 control we don't do crazy things in                                 terms of what it takes to get them up                                 and running that's better you know we                                 want to make it accessible even inside                                 your team and it's really important to                                 do dev staging in production                                 environments you know this is touching                                 it on the technical stuff but you know                                 this is a process that's that's well                                 defined in the Drupal community and if                                 you're a project manager or you're a                                 technical thought leader this is really                                 important to invest in and understand                                 just understand in general you know                                 without these without these kind of                                 mechanisms then that leads a way for                                 stuff getting onto production that that                                 shouldn't necessarily be there and you                                 know one thing that is unique to Drupal                                 is deployment techniques so this means                                 okay we have these three environments so                                 how do we port configuration changes                                 from one environment to another how do                                 we pour code from one environment to                                 another it's it's really really                                 important that there's some sort of                                 strategy and some sort of knowledge                                 gained around this area because this is                                 one of the big problems of Drupal that's                                 one of the challenges we mentioned                                 earlier so you know I think this is one                                 of the biggest things that people                                 stumble across so you know investing                                 some time in order to learn this is very                                 key towards towards being successful                                 going forward I mean we talked a little                                 bit about thought partnership                                 and what does this mean so what this                                 means is that you know you really want                                 to drive goals and innovation so if the                                 client or the stakeholder is really                                 driving the conversation what ends up                                 happening is that you know they say jump                                 you say how high right and it doesn't                                 work that way you know I think when                                 people say ok you know I use an offshore                                 development team for most of my stuff                                 you know usually what they're referring                                 to is they're they're referring to cheap                                 labor that's outsourced and it's they                                 say something and then it gets                                 implemented right that's not necessarily                                 the best way of doing things the value                                 of your organization isn't the code that                                 you write the value of your organization                                 is whether or not you can understand                                 identify and meet the business goals so                                 when you're talking about projects                                 really ask you know what are the                                 business goals that you're trying to                                 achieve and really drive that thought                                 partnership so that you can uncover the                                 pain what's not working for you right                                 why are we here why what problem are we                                 trying to solve and that way you can                                 really drive the requirements as well                                 and that's critical because if you can                                 drive the requirements you know you                                 might not be able to drive the full                                 requirements obviously because people                                 have goals that they want to achieve but                                 if you can frame the discussion and be                                 thought leaders and say this is best                                 practice this is this is you know the                                 best way to accomplish what you're                                 trying to do that's where your value is                                 and that's where people really respect                                 you so you know again just not saying                                 yes we'll do that we'll implement that                                 you know really be thought leaders and                                 engage you know I think one of the one                                 of the big problems too is that people                                 will say yeah we'll do it and then they                                 take one direction and go when we're                                 coming up with solutions and when we're                                 talking with people be it a stakeholder                                 you know someone higher up in your                                 organization or be it a client if you're                                 a Drupal shop providing solutions and                                 options is key right it's ok to say yeah                                 you know if you really want to do this                                 this is the this is the method that                                 you're gonna have to take and it's gonna                                 be a little more expensive or you know                                 this is another option that we could                                 take which pretty much satisfies what                                 you're trying to do and will cost a lot                                 less and be a lot less effort a lot more                                 maintainable going forward                                 so again presenting these options and                                 presenting you know what solution you                                 feel is best in a way that makes sense                                 or you know the customer or stakeholder                                 is really where the value of what you're                                 doing shows and I think you know one                                 thing avoid ports so a lot of times                                 people will say ok let's just get this                                 on Drupal and then we'll go forward                                 right this is a really really tough                                 business model and this is a really                                 really tough thing to do a lot of times                                 it's coming from other CMS's they might                                 be proprietary they might be open source                                 they might be completely custom either                                 way they have a lot of things in here in                                 there that make assumptions to the                                 platform they're running on that may or                                 may not be best practices you know they                                 might be what people are useful to use                                 to that's why they're asking for it one                                 example is that for Drupal Commons we                                 get a lot of requests that look exactly                                 like a SharePoint spec right and that's                                 because people are used to that what we                                 want to say is okay we're gonna you know                                 we're gonna frame this discussion we're                                 not gonna build SharePoint with Drupal                                 Commons what we're gonna do is we're                                 gonna show you a new a better way a more                                 efficient way a more maintainable way of                                 doing group management and collaboration                                 you know we're not in the business of                                 trying to make things that already exist                                 and just make it Drupal so that's very                                 tough to do in experience you know                                 obviously experience just doesn't happen                                 it's really tough to find Drupal talent                                 right now you know I think right now                                 everybody kind of poaches from one                                 another and that's how that's how                                 dribble talent transfers it's it's a                                 it's very tough to find you know new                                 up-and-coming talent and integrate them                                 it is possible a lot of people are                                 making the switch right now from                                 technologies like java.net they're                                 moving into Drupal because it's easier                                 it's a better solution for them you know                                 it doesn't happen overnight it's really                                 important to understand that so one of                                 the things that we talked about is you                                 know the people say oh I have a really                                 strong PHP person they'll just pick it                                 up no problem that's not always the case                                 it might be a completely different way                                 of doing things and how they've done in                                 the past I was coming from the Zen                                 framework where I was building                                 everything it was very much a framework                                 oriented code oriented page builds that                                 sort of thing it was it was a completely                                  blew my mind that all this stuff was                                  being done through the GUI it was it was                                  a really big transition that's why I                                  struggled with it you know empowering                                  your team is kind of a just something                                  that people say but what this means is                                  that you know allow your allow your team                                  to learn right give them the resources                                  invest                                  in order to in order for them to really                                  thrive with Drupal you know just putting                                  them into a situation where okay here's                                  a project go learn go you know learn                                  Drupal on the fly isn't gonna work the                                  team has to be able to be engaged with                                  one another that communication is key                                  and also they have to have some                                  investment into them so that they can                                  you know really learn the platform be                                  successful and you know make sure that                                  they leverage the community avoiding the                                  community is a big problem the community                                  is really what makes power Drupal                                  powerful it's not the software it's it's                                  the community and what as soon as you                                  start working with Drupal you're a part                                  of the community it's not this thing                                  that's you know unattainable and you                                  have to work really hard to join just by                                  downloading installing Drupal you know                                  making a commitment to build a Drupal                                  site you're a part of the community                                  you're a part of the communication and                                  you know it allows you to share                                  knowledge and a lot of people are afraid                                  of this a lot of people say well that's                                  my intellectual property why would I                                  want to give that away and to steal a                                  term from Jeff Eaton who's a pretty                                  well-known well about inside the the                                  community he coined the phrase                                  cooperation I'm not sure if he stole                                  from anyone but I stole for him so                                  that's why I'm going there but you know                                  we're all working with Drupal the real                                  competition is with proprietary vendors                                  that are attacking open source in                                  general and these are this is where                                  Drupal is moving right Jerry said in his                                  keynote that's where the opportunity is                                  even though we might compete with each                                  other and in small areas we're really                                  were more cooperating and we're more                                  sharing ideas so that collectively as a                                  community you know we can all grow                                  there's definitely room for all of us to                                  thrive you know seeing where Drupal is                                  going is very exciting but you know when                                  you start to share knowledge you get a                                  lot of knowledge in return as well so                                  that that's a great inexpensive way in                                  order to empower your team and get them                                  moving in the drupal way and it's                                  something that you shouldn't resist and                                  you know working with the community                                  openly and transparently is very very                                  important you know there's some free                                  things that you can do you can go to                                  conferences you can go to camps go to                                  meetups these are great ways to get your                                  team empowered you know make sure that                                  you make it give them good incentives to                                  go you know maybe a biome a drink or                                  something or send them to a camp                                  might be a little bit far away but this                                  is where relationships are made this is                                  where knowledge is gained this is where                                  your team will thrive and this is where                                  you get the most return from your                                  investments and then you know it's also                                  important to give trainings give your                                  knowledge away this sounds weird but we                                  do this at aqua a lot right we tried to                                  teach people to make ourselves                                  irrelevant right we want you guys to be                                  the next you know Drupal experts that                                  that can thrive and help the community                                  grow you know and that's I think that's                                  really important when you give trainings                                  when you start to give your knowledge                                  away you also become the subject matter                                  and what you're teaching right so you                                  get great visibility you get a lot of                                  business in return it's it's it's a                                  great way to expand your business also                                  get people involved in and/or also get                                  people integrated into your company                                  recruitment it's a great way to expand                                  so you know aqua is sending me here so I                                  do feel obliged to talk about aqua so                                  we'll end with this slide but you know                                  what what can we do for you to help get                                  through some of these barriers and one                                  of the things is professional services                                  right so we have an organization that                                  that's dedicated to providing technical                                  architecture jump-starts so you know                                  intensive week-long trainings in order                                  to get people up and running on Drupal                                  and also you know audits so one of the                                  things is pretty a pre saw a pre site                                  I'm sorry a pre-launch site audit where                                  we can actually you know go and view the                                  code see if it's being adhere to best                                  practice or being in here too and you                                  know it's a very valuable tool in order                                  to make sure you know what gets out                                  there something that's going to scale                                  enterprise support as well we talked                                  about an exit strategy on a lot of times                                  what happens is that a project will be                                  done there is no conversation in terms                                  of what's going to happen after you know                                  projects and evitable II have bugs                                  there's no perfect project it's                                  impossible it really is there's going to                                  be issues the customer is going to come                                  back afterwards and say well you know                                  you built this you need to fix this if                                  they have to pay for it they're gonna be                                  a little bit frustrated this comes back                                  to expectation management with aqua you                                  can actually leverage the enterprise                                  support where you know we can take over                                  that part of the business so that the                                  client remains how                                  right where the throat to choke so to                                  speak so it's it's a nice way to deflect                                  those expectations off of you and on to                                  us and what we've seen is that the                                  customer then returns back to the                                  original company for for future                                  development additional work it ends up                                  being a nice ends up being a nice                                  facilitator for business and we also                                  offer accelerators such as Drupal                                  Gardens Drupal Commons these are things                                  that are prepackaged solution that                                  allows you to get up ready going with                                  Drupal so it's important to note that a                                  lot of these things are free and you can                                  leverage and and you can get up and                                  running as well one thing that's                                  important is that we offer free training                                  for partners so we talked a little bit                                  about expertise right so let's say you                                  have someone that comes into your                                  organization from you know the Java                                  world if you send them to us we will                                  train them for a week for free we won't                                  charge anything and we'll send them                                  right back to you and you know we're                                  putting the investment because we feel                                  really really strongly that you know the                                  success of Drupal is dependent on the                                  talent and the amount of people that can                                  build good projects so you know that's                                  that's something that is really                                  important I will also do joint proposals                                  so if you you know if this is one of                                  your first Drupal projects you want to                                  get going will either do it side by side                                  meaning we're out front you know it's                                  you know it's an aqueous slash company                                  proposal or we'll do it behind the                                  scenes that we're not even viewed by the                                  end customer right you manage that                                  relationship you're the point of contact                                  you know will happily do that also you                                  know we provide the aquitine network                                  which is worth looking out and there's                                  been a couple of announcements but these                                  are tools to help you identify what the                                  problems with your sites are and also                                  provides some knowledge in order to you                                  know increase your understanding of what                                  Drupal does and you know just provides                                  it's a nice facilitator in order to get                                  you going on Drupal and make sure that                                  your your clients projects or your                                  internal projects are successful so you                                  know I think the big thing that I want                                  to take away is you know how can we help                                  you succeed you know we don't have                                  prepackaged stuff we really want to                                  converse with you and figure out how we                                  can help you succeed with Drupal and you                                  know with that I'll end the business                                  pitch and you know let's take some                                  questions have some discussions and yeah                                  we can go from there                                  yes I'm sorry                                  oh I'm sorry                                  I'm sorry kid there was a microphone                                  issue what you're gonna have a                                  microphone so that everybody can hear                                  your questions so I don't have to repeat                                  it because I'm really bad at that                                  hello that's not working                                  yep here so for a company that maybe has                                  an existing system the setup in place                                  and they're looking to move to Drupal if                                  they don't do the research upfront and                                  maybe the viewers will just put our                                  Deb's against it and then you know maybe                                  in two months time we'll have a complete                                  conversion over to the new platform                                  with with sort of viewing this                                  presentation it kind of makes out the                                  Drupal might be an expensive option to                                  move to in the short run so you know in                                  my opinion the investment would be                                  needed as far as Drupal skills go but                                  for some companies and they just think                                  we'll put our IT department against it                                  and we'll try to get something out in                                  five six months yes so you know a lot of                                  a lot of the the first projects with                                  that will will be problematic because                                  what happens is that you put a time                                  frame together of two months but there's                                  no understanding of the problems that                                  actually determine the scope of that                                  project right so also you know there's                                  best practices right how do you achieve                                  that efficiently with Drupal there's a                                  lot of different ways that you can solve                                  the same problem so which one is the                                  right one right that's that's                                  problematic Drupal and open source so                                  you know I think where you see companies                                  like Java right and jive is a                                  proprietary community oriented solution                                  they give slick demos they stand stuff                                  up what ends up happening is that you                                  pay for any any additional customization                                  any additional service you pay for                                  licensing fees right so the cost upfront                                  might not be as much but the maintenance                                  which is where most of IT cost happens                                  is back loaded and then you're stuck                                  right your vendor locked with Drupal you                                  do have to put some investment up front                                  and then the costs tend to Taylor off a                                  tail off over time you know Okwe is not                                  the only solution you know I don't want                                  it I don't want this to be an aqueous                                  there's a lot of companies inside of                                  Drupal that talk with each other this is                                  a great opportunity to talk and to join                                  birds of a feather or buffs to talk to                                  people about those transitions and                                  people are very transparent in terms of                                  what their headaches were what the                                  problems were so that you know you know                                  what areas you might need to invest in                                  in order to get your developers trained                                  and up and running in order to to move                                  to a new system okay                                  yes sorry um                                  yes you just looked that way that's you                                  and just a point of clarification I                                  don't have my glasses on so I can't see                                  anybody be on the front row I just see                                  blobs so I'm coming from a proprietary                                  vendor that's moving from our own CMS to                                  Drupal and the problem that we seem to                                  be we fail to explain the cost in                                  because we come from priority products                                  where we can do pretty much whatever                                  they ask for it's tricky for us to                                  deliver on budget within budget things                                  which they seem to see Drupal as doing                                  very easily so it seems like it seems                                  like Drupal has this unjú unfair                                  profile of being cheap in reality it is                                  experience yeah so I mean the big thing                                  is Drupal is not free right I mean                                  Drupal is free to download Drupal is                                  free to use open source what you're                                  doing is instead of investing in                                  licensing fees which don't really have a                                  value you're investing in services in                                  order to improve your product so I think                                  you know the big thing with Drupal is                                  that it has a value of innovation                                  meaning that you know for example Google                                  Fonts came out and then there was a                                  module that next day right was it                                  perfect no but we're people talking                                  about it yes it wasn't on a some road                                  map that might not be achieved you know                                  I think in your case I think a lot of                                  times are you working with any other                                  Drupal companies now or are you are you                                  have previous but we've previously used                                  accelerators                                  okay I'm so well you're not working with                                  other companies in terms of I mean how                                  long how long have you been using Drupal                                  years okay so when did you make the                                  switch yeah I think that that's really                                  important so whenever we talk about                                  modules we talk about okay what's what                                  is it with a module that you're getting                                  right you're getting something that's                                  free and you're getting something that                                  you know doesn't have a roadmap                                  necessarily and something that takes                                  effort in order to implement right it's                                  not just kind of a plug-and-play the                                  benefit is that there's a lot of                                  innovation with innovation comes a                                  little bit of you know instability in                                  terms of in terms of new code that's out                                  there so you know I think the advice                                  that I'd say is make sure that you know                                  tested stuff is used right that's that's                                  really really important even if it might                                  even if there's a module that                                  specifically does what you're looking                                  for if it doesn't have a lot of usages                                  under maintain that'll be a problem a                                  lot of times you know you use the stuff                                  that's tested I mean just explaining to                                  the customer that yes okay you know                                  here's here's the reason why you're                                  using Drupal you're using Drupal because                                  you know it's there's no licensing fees                                  so when you're investing money you're                                  investing in improving your application                                  and also you know you're you're not a                                  hole you're not held to a proprietary                                  vendors roadmap with that there's gonna                                  be work you know do open source will get                                  you ninety seventy-five percent of the                                  way there you might have to put some                                  cost up in order to get to the rest of                                  the                                                                      maintenance overtime will decrease which                                  is really where most of the IT spending                                  happens that he was                                  I'm just what I can hear you I can't see                                  you but I can hear you I'm just                                  wondering what problems you've observed                                  as you have to try and keep your                                  solution up-to-date as the core and the                                  contributed modules continue to upgrade                                  and how you deal with that right so you                                  know I think that's a Drupal innovates                                  very fast and with that you know it's                                  not on a set road map I think core is on                                  a better roadmap                                  but obviously the contributed modules                                  move pretty quick and have to be updated                                  you know I think Drupal does a pretty                                  good job of telling you what needs to be                                  updated and then there's automated tools                                  such as drush that help facilitate that                                  and as long as you're not making major                                  changes as long as these are minor point                                  releases generally Drupal works out okay                                  but what you want to do is you want to                                  make sure that these upgrades are tested                                  in a in a staging environment first                                  before going into production right you                                  don't just want to upgrade your modules                                  in production that's that's tough to do                                  and this is this is an area where where                                  expertise comes into play again I hate                                  to do the Aqua pitch but I think it's                                  important is that the support                                  understands what the different conflicts                                  are right so they support thousands of                                  applications and they see a lot of the                                  stuff that isn't apparent to everybody                                  right they know that if you upgrade                                  views to                                                            there's a                                                         hypothetical that there's going to be a                                  conflict with another module you know so                                  I mean I think that's that's a problem                                  as well but if you look at proprietary                                  solutions and the cost of upgrading                                  there that's why we see a lot of people                                  coming back to Drupal or coming to                                  Drupal off of these proprietary                                  solutions is because the cost of                                  upgrading is so steep                                  whereas Drupal it's not free you do have                                  to do some testing you do have to do                                  some work but it's you know that's one                                  of those hidden costs that you don't                                  want to make hidden you want to be                                  transparent about it you want to be                                  upfront about it and as long as people                                  understand you know why this cost is                                  there and why it benefits them you know                                  generally they're receptive to that as                                  long as they expect it                                  hello                                  my question is around changing how                                  clients see                                  I'm increasingly seeing the need for                                  projects that run for several years                                  so the right approach meaning long long                                  phase long projects where small chunks                                  right right                                  right and that's                                  right so I mean in terms of a website                                  you know it's really important                                  identifying their business goals right                                  why are there why is our website there                                  so I think a big example is Twitter                                  right so Twitter recently moved to                                  Drupal it's pretty public that happen                                  the reason why they moved to Drupal is                                  because they were having problems                                  monetizing they were they were freaking                                  they were trying to figure out where to                                  how to monetize their product and they                                  were they they were really there was a                                  disconnect between their their community                                  right so what they had to do was they                                  had to build a solution they had to come                                  up with a solution that could be                                  implemented quickly they're there Ruby                                  everything in Twitter's you know they're                                  there Ruby developers they couldn't do                                  it quickly with Ruby so they had to use                                  Drupal started with Drupal Commons and                                  then you know kind of pared it down a                                  little bit but you know the reason why                                  they were able do is because they were                                  able to do it quickly and they were able                                  to they're able to react right so now                                  that they have community engagement now                                  what happens when the community starts                                  engaging nobody really knows I mean it's                                  not the success of a project isn't when                                  it launches the success of the project                                  is how you can adapt one year after you                                  actually figure out how people are going                                  to use your site so I think you know                                  with Drupal it allows you to do that                                  because there there's free software I                                  mean there's obviously a cost of                                  implementing that but it's far less than                                  you know if you have to do a complete                                  customization on top of a proprietary                                  solution so you know I think again the                                  value of innovation is really what sells                                  Drupal so you know communicating that                                  and communicating why that fits the                                  business need of the client is is                                  critical                                  hi you said that you come from a zine                                  framework background yes and I was                                  wondering if you had any tips on how to                                  how to convince a strong world but yeah                                  convinced developers but the Drupal is a                                  good Avenue for them when an MVC                                  background right right so you know I                                  think a lot of times with developers you                                  know myself included is that when you                                  code something it's yours and you                                  understand exactly how it works there's                                  that familiarity there's that comfort                                  with Drupal a lot of times you're you're                                  giving up some of that comfort right                                  you're relying on what other people have                                  done from a business standpoint that's                                  really really important right from a                                  business standpoint it's important that                                  you know your your intellectual property                                  isn't consolidated in one person is that                                  you're using contributed solutions and                                  that you're able to tap into the                                  knowledge of others outside of your                                  organization because you know if                                  somebody leaves and a site that depends                                  on them goes down because they're not                                  there anymore that's a problem for                                  business for developers you know what I                                  like to say with Drupal is that was then                                  framework I found that I was coding a                                  lot of trivial things so I was doing a                                  lot of database connections I was doing                                  a lot of queries that sort of thing you                                  know and obviously that products                                  improving and you know I actually have a                                  module that integrates with it but but                                  regardless I was starting to do a lot of                                  the same things what Drupal you can                                  really focus on the interesting things                                  so if you leverage the community you                                  know you're not focusing on mundane                                  tasks like user authentication you're                                  actually working on the interesting                                  stuff you know for example for me it's                                  all about searching and improving the                                  search interface that's really exciting                                  to me and interesting to me I don't have                                  to worry about connecting the solar                                  right Peter we'll Anna in the Apache                                  solar module does that you know Thomas                                  Seidel and search api connects to all                                  the other stuff I just worry about                                  focusing on the search interface and and                                  it allows me to focus on the interesting                                  things to me and to me that's the best                                  selling point for developers is that                                  they don't have to code the mundane                                  stuff and they can start to code the                                  interesting stuff and they don't have to                                  repeat what they're doing over and over                                  again                                  are we good                                  all right well thank you guys very much                                  appreciate you all coming up
