Title: DrupalCon London 2011: KEYNOTE: THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	In recent years the internet has enabled a flowering of easy-to-use publishing tools that have made media more social, participatory and conversational in nature. But this phenomenon is not as new as it appears. The roots of social media be traced back to Roman times. Indeed, before the emergence of technologies of mass dissemination in the 19th century most media was in fact social and participatory in nature. It's the past 170 years, during which social media were overshadowed by centralised mass media, that is the real anomaly in historical terms. The rise of social media in the internet era is thus, in many ways, a return to the traditional way of doing things. I will examine the prehistory of social media over the past two millennia and place the construction and use of today's publishing tools in their full historical context.

been                                  years ago so I feel really old anyway I                               hope you've all had enough coffee I                               understand from Twitter

yes I'm the digital editor                                at The Economist and one of my                                responsibilities is editorial oversight                                of our of our website economist com and                                we have an excellent technical team                                where are they they're kind of spread                                out okay I'm very pleased to say they've                                recently completed a very painful                                migration from a certain other content                                management system coldfusion boo is to a                                much more flexible and open and capable                                content management system namely Drupal                                hooray and this was have the lips Ruby                                smoothie and it's great so we ritually                                killed cold fusion earlier this month we                                wanted to like burn the discs and shred                                the manuals and everything that we                                couldn't actually find anything but                                anyway that means we can now concentrate                                fully on adding new features to our site                                so what are we going to add what we're                                going to add of course lots of social                                and community features and of course                                this is what everyone's doing as you                                will all be aware websites aren't so                                much the way they were in the web                                    where it was about pushing stuff to                                people today it's all about enabling                                connections between the people on those                                sites that means comment debates                                discussion social features in general                                and the modern web is all about                                participation and discussion in                                collaboration and so forth it's a social                                medium and everyone's crazy about                                anything to do with social media today                                so what I want to argue today is that                                the notion of social media this whole                                phenomenon of the horizontal exchange of                                information between                                people rather than the vertical delivery                                of information from above from a central                                source this whole idea is not new it's                                an idea that goes back a long way at                                least as far as the Roman era in fact                                before the advent of technologies of                                mass dissemination and that really                                starts with the steam press and then the                                radio and then television there was no                                efficient way of getting information to                                large numbers of people quickly and the                                only way could travel was from one                                person to another person so it's not too                                much of an exaggeration to say that                                before the rise of the mass media in the                                                                                                      there are some differences today social                                media is global it's instant it's                                permanent it's searchable and back in                                the day though it was actually more                                social people used to gather in taverns                                and coffeehouses and discuss things and                                talk to each other as they pass them                                around and then they went to other                                places and pass them on again so there                                are some differences but the underlying                                dynamics I would like to argue are                                actually the same so another way to look                                at this is that we're used to the idea                                that new media is different from the old                                media that came before it but my point                                is it's really quite similar to the                                really old media that came before that                                so I'm going to tell you about some                                historical examples of social media and                                I think the parallels are very                                informative with what we're all doing                                today we can see history with new eyes                                as a result of our familiarity with                                social media today and at the same time                                I think we can learn a lesson or two                                because many of the questions people are                                asking today about social media also                                arose in the past so so let's get                                started with some Romans so here is a                                Roman using a laptop                                this isn't a fake this is real and there                                are Greek vases that look the same the                                 Romans it turned out had laptops and                                 they had tablets the tablets are there                                 some pictures of these on flickr                                 actually and they're amazing people have                                 reconstructed them they look exactly                                 like the ipad but unfortunately the                                 image that showed this best was it                                 something i could really nick off flickr                                 better go and look look at it it's it's                                 got a border it's about same size as                                 iPads got a wooden border and it has a                                 surface of black wax and you would                                 scrape on it with a stylus so it's like                                 one of those old tablets that no one                                 ever use that had a stylus and then this                                 thing here well this is one of those                                 reading tablets you'd use that for                                 sketches and a notes of that sort of                                 thing and then the way scribes used to                                 write on papyrus scrolls amazingly the                                 Romans hadn't actually hit on the idea                                 of a writing desk so scribes used to sit                                 down and they used to essentially                                 stretch the surface of the papyrus                                 between their knees on their toga there                                 was literally on their lap anyway what's                                 going on well in the Roman era the first                                 century BC in particular Rome had become                                 the very sprawling I wasn't an empire                                 yet but it had quite sprawling                                 territories and unlike the Greek                                 civilization which involved autonomous                                 city-states without central control Rome                                 was a centralized system of government                                 and so the only way it could really run                                 things and stay in touch with what was                                 going on in the provinces was by sending                                 letters backwards and forwards so there                                 was this blizzard of letters going back                                 and forwards everyone wanted to know                                 what was going on in Rome what were the                                 latest political machinations what were                                 the latest speeches there was a sort of                                 newspaper that Julius Caesar founded and                                 it was published but it was only                                 published in one copy and that one copy                                 was put up in the forum so if you wanted                                 to know what was going on like this this                                 woman here I think you'd send your                                 scribe down to the forum and they would                                 write down the bits of the of the this                                 news sheet that was relevant to you and                                 then you could read it at your leisure                                 while you were having breakfast and you                                 have it read to you and that but what                                 you then do is when you were writing to                                 your friends outside the city you would                                 say I hear that this has happened and                                 you would send them the most important                                 bits of the news and you would also send                                 them snippets of information you'd heard                                 from other people in letters and so                                 merchants and soldiers and officials at                                 distant parts would circulate news from                                 the heart of the Republic within their                                 social circles and they would share                                 extracts from letters and speeches and                                 that sort of thing so the information                                 really was travelling along these social                                 networks and letters were weird they                                 were semi public documents in the Roman                                 era it was quite difficult to keep them                                 private you often had to give them to                                 people you maybe didn't trust to carry                                 there wasn't a postal service so you had                                 to ask friends or travelers or anyone                                 moving in vaguely the right direction if                                 they would take letters for you and in                                 addition to the letters not being                                 terribly private and secure they were                                 very widely copied and passed around so                                 if we look at the letters of Cicero                                 which are the best preserved set of                                 letters from this period we here's a                                 letter where he says I sent you on march                                 the                                                                    and of Caesars letter to him then on                                 that very day I got a letter from Gaius                                 pedius saying that Caesar had written to                                 him as follows so you can see what                                 Cicero is doing is he's sending chunks                                 of letters and in some cases of copies                                 of entire letters along with his own                                 letters another example Caesar has sent                                 me a short letter of which I've subdue                                 copy it's like an attachment and Antony                                 has said me a copy of a letter from                                 Caesar so these letters are all being                                 passed around there they're semi public                                 documents so this was absolutely normal                                 and accepted and if you wanted to keep                                 things quiet you'd have to use a code or                                 or really you know request that thing's                                 be kept quiet and send the message and                                 the hands of somebody really trusted and                                 cicero back when he's the governor of                                 silly cheer which is near Syria now he                                 had all of this news coming at him from                                 Rome he had one of his protege 'he's                                 copy the roman newspaper every day and                                 and send that and then everyone else was                                 writing him letters and sister                                 said others will write many will bring                                 me news much too will reach me even in                                 the way of rumor and a time Cicero                                 rector his friend Atticus every day for                                 weeks at a time so that all these                                 letters going all over the place at the                                 same time as Caesar in fact was said to                                 be able to dictate to letters at once so                                 they were they were just constantly                                 living at this bubble of media and books                                 and speeches were also published in this                                 way you couldn't really publish                                 something in large quantities because                                 there was no printing so instead the way                                 you got your stuff out there was you had                                 a couple of copies made by your scribes                                 and then you gave them to your                                 influential contacts and they would read                                 them and if they wanted to they could                                 have them copied and then pass them on                                 and this is how books were published in                                 the Roman era and we know of one Roman                                 doctor whose epitaph says that he wrote                                                                                                       survives none of the books do and they                                 probably just existed in a single copy                                 he would write this book scroll and then                                 he would read bits of it to his friends                                 and lend it to them and they could read                                 it if they wanted to they could copy it                                 but that was what publishing was it was                                 just passing things around within a                                 social network and we know that speeches                                 were passed around like this as well if                                 he wrote a particularly good speech then                                 you might um let your friends have                                 copies of it so that they could refer to                                 it and also because the accounts of it                                 that might be circulating otherwise                                 might not be accurate and so Cicero                                 delivered a series of speeches called                                 the philippic but the second of them he                                 was unable to deliver it because he                                 couldn't get to the to the Senate House                                 and so it was in fact I've just sort of                                 published in that way and that counted                                 as well as publishing it and in fact                                 more people would have read it than                                 would have heard it anyway so again                                 you've got speeches and books travelling                                 along these social networks and this is                                 essentially used from your social                                 network its social filtering social                                 distribution it's commenting it's                                 recommending it's liking and the                                 enabling technology of all of this were                                 the scribes so this is some to roman                                 pupils being forced to learn how to read                                 and or possibly training escribes you've                                 got the teacher in the middle and the                                 guy on the right has arrived a bit late                                 but that looks like a scroll case that                                 he's carrying there anyway scribes are                                 the enabling infrastructure here that                                 scribes were kind of a bit like                                 broadband in the sense that when you had                                 one the marginal cost of information was                                 zero if somebody lent you a book and you                                 thought this is a pretty good book I'd                                 like a copy of this in my library you                                 give it to your scribe and say you make                                 a copy of this please then make a copy                                 of it and then you could pass the book                                 on so you just had to wait for the book                                 to sort of appear in your library and                                 then you knew it would always sit there                                 and cicero back had a particularly good                                 scribe called tyro who among other                                 things it seems to bend the inventor of                                 shorthand in this meant that Cicero had                                 a higher bandwidth than other Romans                                 when it came to dealing with this deluge                                 of information that was flowing all over                                 the place so this is all one form of                                 conversational of social participate                                 treat media in the Roman period there's                                 another one which also looks quite                                 familiar and this is from Pompeii turns                                 out the Romans were very keen on writing                                 things on people's walls and some of                                 them were official announcements and                                 some of them were just silly old                                 graffiti so some examples of graffiti                                 from Pompeii we have examples from                                 Pompeii and Herculaneum because they                                 were buried by the eruption of Vesuvius                                 but presumably the same was true on the                                 walls of other Roman towns throughout                                 the Roman period so this should be                                 representative of the kinds of things                                 that Roman saw as they walked around                                 wherever they were so from Pompeii we                                 have quite a boring advert to rent from                                 the first day of next July shops with                                 floors over them fine upper chambers in                                 the house in the illness polio block

                                      by ignorance alius together with their                                 substitutes will fight at Pompeii on the                                 vember the

 if anyone shall hand over the thief he                                 will be rewarded and then there's                                 something get reads a lot like a status                                 update at Masseria I won                                                by gaming whoo fair play and my favorite                                 piece of ramen graffiti is actually                                 addressed to the wall itself and it says                                 I admire you wall I admire you for not                                 falling down when you have to carry so                                 much tedious writing so even in the                                 Roman period people are saying oh god                                 it's over sharing of all this stuff                                 people writing all this tedious rubbish                                 on their walls and in fact Cicero                                 complains when he's got this stream of                                 information coming in to him in Syria                                 that there's there's too much that he                                 doesn't need to know about the trivia in                                 particular he doesn't need to be told                                 the gladiator results he regards those                                 as superfluous for his political                                 purposes anyway the streets in pompeii                                 and herculaneum with the most graffiti                                 of those that lead towards the gates of                                 the city and they're the most highly                                 trafficked bits of Lea of the town so                                 this was a media environment in which                                 official and personal messages were                                 mixed with a funny thing about Roman                                 graffiti is that um you actually get it                                 inside people's houses as well and it                                 wasn't you even get it in the high                                 status houses in the high status rooms                                 so it wasn't regarded as to facing the                                 wall to write a message on it and the                                 messages are quite small I mean it you                                 know they're not they're not probably                                 but you can see them and in a sense it                                 was a way of saying look I'm literate                                 you're literate we could write messages                                 to each other it was kind of you know                                 you were showing off the literacy of                                 your friends on your wall it's kind of                                 what people do on facebook today are                                 quite small and unobtrusive little                                 messages so one man leaves many in                                 continual greetings to his brother and                                 the brother replies and lots of                                 greetings to you too                                 and then we see in other cases we see                                 sort of back and forth messages both                                 inside houses inside apartment blocks                                 and on the walls of public streets my                                 favorite example comes actually from the                                 inside of an apartment block and where                                 somebody writes a few lines of poetry on                                 the wall and other people then sort of                                 riff on it and they try and outdo each                                 other and follow up on it and it's like                                 a little comment thread and the question                                 here is you know how literate were the                                 Romans well um the idea that literacy is                                 binary is is just wrong and I think we                                 can see that today with computer                                 literacy people say are you computer                                 literate or not now I don't know would I                                 say my mother was computer literate well                                 there are some things you can do but                                 there are some things that she can't                                 there's clearly a continuum of literacy                                 and the same is true of ordinary                                 literacy there's some of these messages                                 you can actually see it says there's a                                 slogan or something that's written and                                 the underneath it says so-and-so wrote                                 this and what that means is that                                 somebody has asked somebody else to                                 write something on their behalf and this                                 is what would happen you would get your                                 friends who are more literate than you                                 to help you out as we do today with our                                 computers anyway so you've got this idea                                 of public discussion and information                                 flying around and who who made the best                                 use of this what surprisingly it was                                 someone that the Romans didn't initially                                 approve of and it's Paul of Tarsus                                 better known as as st. Paul and he was                                 probably the most successful user of                                 Roman social media because he used open                                 letters otherwise known as epistles to                                 churches in different towns and regions                                 as you spread the Christian faith around                                 the Mediterranean and he wrote these                                 letters to resolve doctrinal disputes                                 and arguments to offer advice to offer                                 support during periods of persecution                                 and that sort of thing and this meant                                 that even though a letter was written in                                 a particular context to a particular                                 Church it had great interest to other                                 churches to other Christian communities                                 in other places and in fact in other                                 times later on and these epistles enable                                 pool to maintain the stability and unity                                 of the new church that he was                                 establishing his letters were read out                                 discussed copied passed to other                                 churches and eventually they became part                                 of the New Testament in fact they're                                 still being read out in churches                                 today they're still going this is Roman                                 social media that still going today now                                 that's what I call social distribution                                 and there are scholars who talk about a                                 Christian media revolution because the                                 the early Christian church made very                                 skilled use of the of the technology of                                 literacy at the time and of course                                 ultimately papyrus books gave way to                                 modern books at the form of a codex with                                 pages and with paper but today we're                                 still using some of the technologies of                                 the Roman period we're still using their                                 alphabet and now that we're using                                 computers again once again we actually                                 scroll through the news which some                                 people didn't do for a long time okay                                 let's leap forward we're going to leap                                 forward to the Reformation so there was                                 a guy called Johann Tetzel and he was                                 given the job by the Vatican of raising                                 the money to pay for some Peter's                                 Basilica which is the enormous church in                                 Rome and he came up with the brilliant                                 idea of selling indulgences which are                                 basically tickets into heaven and he had                                 this great slogan for them as well as                                 soon as the gold in the casket rings the                                 rescued soul to heaven springs and the                                 idea was no matter how bad you've been                                 or were planning to be you could buy in                                 indulgence and then everything would be                                 fine you'd still get into heaven now the                                 fact that this actually conflicted with                                 church doctrine at the time didn't stop                                 him but it but Martin Luther who was a                                 priest in in Germany at the time thought                                 this was absolutely outrageous and he                                 wrote to his superior's saying this is                                 this is not at all it won't do he wrote                                 the                                                           indulgences he sent this to his local                                 bishop and archbishop and his friends                                 started to pass this around and they                                 were then translated into German and                                 printed in January of                                           sometimes said that he'd nailed the                                 theses to adore and that doesn't seem to                                 be true so nice idea but it doesn't seem                                 to be the case anyway they quickly                                 spread throughout Germany and in the                                 space of about two weeks and because                                 people discuss them                                 preachers who agreed with Luther read                                 out what he'd written and that meant                                 people in their congregation said oh I                                 want to find out more about this I'm                                 going to go and see if I can get hold of                                 copy of this pamphlet and then they                                 would take it to other churches and                                 other towns are the printers in those                                 towns would be being asked about this                                 have you got this this pamphlet by                                 Luther so they would make copies of it                                 not everyone could read or afford to buy                                 pamphlets but they would be exposed to                                 the ideas by talking to other people by                                 discussing them in church by hearing                                 from preachers one preacher said that he                                 had on one occasion spread Luther's                                 words to three thousand people so you've                                 got these incredible sort of multiplying                                 effects and there was a huge public                                 debate was this right was it correct                                 that selling condolences was wrong did                                 Luther have the right to challenge the                                 supremacy of the Vatican at Luther                                 followed up with                                                      works by the end of                                                    sermon on indulgences and back to loan                                 was reprinted                                                          continued to respond to his critics                                 because some people started to objecting                                 and writing back and he was one of those                                 people who if someone disagrees with you                                 he has to respond he absolutely has to                                 rebut whatever you say and I think we                                 all know bloggers like that and while it                                 appears pamphlets in                                                 thousand copies in five days and went                                 through a further                                                      of these pamphlets cost about four                                 pfennigs which is about the same as a                                 chicken and if you think about what a                                 chicken costs today it's about the same                                 as you know buying a glossy magazine                                 like vogue or something like that so it                                 was not cheap but affordable for for                                 working people now obviously quantcast                                 and omniture and all that sort of thing                                 didn't exist in them in                                              turns out that you can reconstruct                                 Martin Luther's traffic stats                                 and it also turns out that you can                                 divide them between the German and the                                 Latin user bases and this is because if                                 you're writing a pamphlet that's mainly                                 for ecclesiastical consumption you write                                 it in Latin because they're going to                                 speak Latin and if you're writing one                                 for a general audience then you write it                                 in German and so you can see there's                                 this massive spike                                                       actually measuring is the number of                                 times that an individual pamphlet was                                 reprinted so it's not the number of                                 sales it's essentially that it's like                                 the retweets or the reblogged on tumblr                                 something like that but it meant that                                 when there was something that was                                 particularly popular it would spread                                 very quickly and it would get reprinted                                 there was no copyright people just                                 reprinted things and it said in fact                                 that the initial pamphlet spread within                                 germany in two weeks and throughout                                 europe in two months and anyway the best                                 estimates are that between six million                                 and seven million religious pamphlets                                 were sold in germany that's the overall                                 number of pamphlets this is the number                                 of additions in the first decade of the                                 Reformation and quite a lot of that we                                 were actually written by lay men and                                 women they weren't written by members of                                 the clergy and I'll come on to why that                                 was in a minute but that was the                                 interesting thing that these were                                 ordinary people access to the press was                                 you know if you could afford to just buy                                 the paper and pay someone to print                                 things really wasn't that expensive you                                 do a run of a thousand or something like                                 that and buying a pamphlet was a badge                                 of identity for Luther's supporters it                                 was very often the first printed work                                 they'd have bought and buying a Bible                                 was incredibly expensive it was several                                 years wages you could buy a pamphlet and                                 that showed where you stood and you                                 could show it to other people so his                                 writing defined a community of people                                 who who signed up who liked what he did                                 and Luther also wrote a vernacular hymns                                 that the congregation's could sing that                                 were in German instead of in Latin again                                 he wanted to get people to participate                                 in the service in a way that they                                 previously couldn't but the main thing                                 what was really brilliant about this was                                 that Luther's message was reinforced by                                 the medium in which he presented it the                                 pamphlet itself it could be bought by                                 anyone it could advance an argument and                                 then the reader could make up their own                                 mind this was a really radical idea                                 because it's circumvented although                                 t it circumvented the decision-making                                 elite at the Catholic Church and litters                                 message was brilliantly congruent with                                 that because his message was that the                                 clergy was fraudulently claiming to have                                 to mediate between ordinary people and                                 God and he said that's silly we should                                 be able to deal with God directly and so                                 by cutting out the authority figures by                                 talking directly to people with                                 pamphlets he was doing the same thing                                 that he wanted them to do which is deal                                 directly with God you don't need to go                                 through a priest now this was a massive                                 problem for the catholic church and they                                 faced a dilemma that's very similar to                                 the problem that i say a large                                 multinational company faces today when                                 people start being nasty about them on                                 twitter should they respond what should                                 they do does it is it right to even                                 dignify a crazy critic with a response                                 well that was initially the the position                                 that the Catholic Church took because                                 they their position was it was                                 inappropriate for the common people to                                 even discuss religious disputes so to                                 respond to Luther and say he's wrong and                                 his why and please buy our pamphlet that                                 tells you was actually going against                                 everything that the Catholic Church                                 believed in and by their very existence                                 in fact Catholic pamphlets rebutting                                 Luther did what they argued should not                                 be done and worse than that in order to                                 explain Luther's views and say why they                                 were wrong the Catholic pamphlets                                 actually spread them even further and my                                 favorite example of this is that Luther                                 wrote would rather obscure pamphlet in                                 Latin called on the Babylonian captivity                                 of the church so this would be one of                                 these black things down here and this is                                 pretty obscure liturgical in a                                 theological argument but it particularly                                 irritated the the Catholic Church and so                                 one of Luther's opponents went to the                                 trouble of translating it from Latin                                 into German so that people could read it                                 and so that he could rebut it and the                                 problem was that his translation was                                 really popular but his rebuttal wasn't                                 this because people actually wanted to                                 read what Luther had to say so my                                 translator get into German he thought                                 this we're done you know make his point                                 for him everyone be able to see how                                 wrong Luther was and in fact the                                 opposite was the case                                 people agreed with Luther um so a papal                                 bull of                                                                  boar escaped in the church's vineyard                                 and he was excommunicated but buying his                                 use of social media of the day he                                 treated the Reformation he had taken on                                 the biggest authority in his world at                                 the time and that's that's really                                 striking illustration of the power that                                 grassroots media can have in taking on                                 enormous authoritarian governments                                 companies and so on it's very early                                 example let's move now to England which                                 is where the the action shifts to the                                 Reformation alerted everyone to the                                 power of printing plus social                                 distribution and its power to spread                                 radical ideas and the result was a clamp                                 down against printing across Europe so                                 Germany introduced censorship the                                 Catholic Church issues a list of banned                                 books England limited the right to print                                 two members of the stationers company a                                 French printer was burnt at the stake                                 causing most of the other printers in                                 France to flee to the Netherlands which                                 became a haven for printers and                                 typographers of course it still is where                                 the font industry's base and the result                                 was actually a reconstitution of the                                 Roman style news system people actually                                 felt happier writing to each other in                                 manuscript form because letters were                                 less likely to be intercepted and                                 censored although they were occasionally                                 but essentially the Roman system                                 reconstituted itself but then in the                                                                                                    happened in England as England slid into                                 civil war the crown lost control over                                 printing and the result was a profusion                                 of pamphlets and news books at                                 broadsides and other printed matter and                                 that you could pretty much publish                                 anything for a while and as a result                                 people could see what a really Free                                 Press looked like and this was some this                                 was something that could happen in                                 England in particular because there was                                 an unusually high level of literacy in                                 England after Henry the Eighth had                                 broken away from the Roman Catholic                                 Church having a Bible in English and                                 separating the Church of England from                                 the Church of Rome became an important                                 part of British national identity and                                 and so being able to read be able to                                 read the Bible in your own own language                                 was something the government was quite                                 keen on and so there was actually a                                 higher level of literacy                                 in England than they were that there was                                 in other parts of Europe at the time                                 anyway this then opened the door to the                                 rival pamphleteers of the the Civil War                                 period and they attacked each other and                                 provided wildly differing accounts of                                 battles often within a few days of the                                 events they described and there was for                                 the first time a battle for public                                 opinion and this was new both sides were                                 yes fighting on the battlefield but they                                 were also fighting in the marketplace of                                 ideas to give an example the Battle of                                 Edgehill one of the battles of the                                 English Civil War on October the                                                                                                             about the battle were available on sale                                 in London by the following Friday and                                 all of them took the form of reprints of                                 letters from soldiers who'd been at the                                 scene or claimed to have been and                                 pamphlets of the speeches given by the                                 King beforehand to encourage his troops                                 and to thank them afterwards were also                                 published and this and this was                                 published and then the parliamentarian                                 side issued a rebuttal against that                                 pamphlet and then the royalists                                 responded to that and so there was this                                 sort of war of the pamphlets going on                                 and people would copy them and reprint                                 them and send them to their friends and                                 they were also used ballads which were                                 essentially the news set to a popular                                 tune so it could be sung in a tavern and                                 this would also give you a bit of cover                                 when you ought to say something a bit                                 satirical in more difficult times when                                 there was actually censorship because                                 you could just say it was just a silly                                 song but we have accounts of battles                                 speeches political maneuverings from                                 politicians from people at the time from                                 soldiers all the way throughout the                                 civil war being passed around discussed                                 copied reprinted the authors were mostly                                 not paid and what the custom at the time                                 was that you did this in return for a                                 few free copies of your pamphlets so                                 somebody would agree to put up the money                                 to print it if they thought what you had                                 to say would sell you would provide the                                 copy and you get some free free copies                                 back which you could give to your                                 friends or sale or whatever it was a                                 sort of Huffington Post model that you                                 were you were doing it for the for the                                 publicity and the interesting thing                                 about the pamphlets of this period is                                 that for the first time we get this                                 dialogic presentation where you reprint                                 bits of other pamphlets in order to                                 argue against them so it's like when you                                 blockquote things in in blog posts and                                 you sort of argue against people                                 point at a time and this encourages                                 readers to seek out the original and if                                 you actually misquote someone                                 deliberately to make them look stupid                                 you will be found out because people                                 will go and find the originals and this                                 means you've got an argument that's                                 actually based on ideas and reason and                                 not just appeals to divine authority and                                 the idea is that you're trying to lead                                 the reader to a particular conclusion                                 which they may or may not agree with so                                 that's a very interesting step forward                                 that instead of just saying I'm the king                                 or I'm the Pope and therefore I'm right                                 you're trying to argue with people and                                 his Parliament tried to recreate control                                 over printing and John Milton published                                 a famous pamphlet is very hard to                                 pronounce and it's called Areopagitica                                 and it was one of the first                                 philosophical defenses of the principle                                 of free speech it was written as a                                 speech but Roman style it was never                                 actually delivered as a speech it was                                 just distributed as a pamphlet but his                                 point was that the contest between rival                                 views helped people discover the truth                                 ultimately even if some of what some                                 people said was wrong or misguided or                                 whatever he just had as many people as                                 possible expressing their opinions then                                 people could figure it out for                                 themselves and he said let's truth and                                 falsehood grapple whoever new truth put                                 to the worse in a free and open                                 encounter so that's the origin of the                                 idea that freedom of expression freedom                                 of speech freedom of the press are a                                 good thing because they elect people                                 figure stuff out for themselves and the                                 same spirit the doctrine of the                                 marketplace of ideas animated the                                 Scientific Revolution instead of just                                 accepting information from an infallible                                 authority in this case the Greeks so                                 scientists just thought the Greeks were                                 right about everything and they weren't                                 they got all sorts of things wrong they                                 thought that the earth was the center of                                 the universe will find a lot of them did                                 they thought that heavy objects felt                                 faster the light objects they thought                                 the heart was a furnace that heated the                                 blood and so forth the                                              people started saying I on a minute they                                 might have got this wrong let's go and                                 do some experiments let's actually test                                 nature directly ourselves and let's find                                 out the truth and interestingly                                 scientists of this period also decided                                 that instead of sitting on their results                                 hoarding them as secrets they would                                 share them with each other and                                 cross-check them and build on each                                 other's work and this is when we get the                                 first scientific journals it's another                                 form of social media and and there                                 art offers pamphlets and summaries of                                 meetings often held in coffeehouses and                                 the papers were then they were written                                 by scientists for their peers so that                                 they could build on each other's work                                 and this is also i would argue the                                 origins of the open source movement I                                 mean this is the basic idea the open                                 source movement is the scientific method                                 applied to software so I think this all                                 goes back to the                                               coffeehouses because we're still still                                 fueled by caffeine today it's still the                                 fuel of the information economy and I                                 hope you've all had enough this morning                                 the issue thing about these coffeehouses                                 you could get your mail in a coffee                                 house because there was no street                                 numbering so you'd say write to me at                                 the rainbow coffeehouse you could read                                 the news because they would have all the                                 latest pamphlets and new sheets on the                                 table you could talk to people you could                                 write a pamphlet in the corner and then                                 have it published and coffee house is                                 actually specialized in the discussion                                 of particular topics marine insurance                                 the stock exchange science there was one                                 where the actors went there was another                                 whether sailors went and so forth and                                 these actually turned into the embryos                                 of modern institutions Jonathan's coffee                                 house turned into the London Stock                                 Exchange it's where the traders went to                                 do business Lloyd's was a coffee house                                 turned into an insurance company and                                 summaries of coffee house discussions                                 were republished in magazines to enable                                 people outside the city out of the                                 properties to get a flavor of the                                 discussion so coffee was this fuel of                                 innovation and I've talked about the                                 coffeehouse internet in one of my books                                 and there are also invisible colleges as                                 they were called these were groups of                                 scientists who never actually met they                                 just correspond it by letter it was very                                 much like sort of mailing list approach                                 and they would discuss new theories and                                 new experiments so the modern ideas of                                 free speech at the Free Press and modern                                 science and even open source I would                                 argue stem from this period and the idea                                 that openness and sharing and testing                                 ideas against each other in this sort of                                 open shared information environment                                 means fewer errors makes it easier to                                 build on other people's work and I think                                 that's something we can all relate to                                 okay so now to America                                 the idea of freedom of expression spread                                 like a virus from Britain and in                                 particular to America the papers in the                                 American colonies were pretty hard for                                 the authorities to control any way from                                 London they were far away and by this                                 stage the government itself had actually                                 bought into the idea of freedom of the                                 press freedom of expression was part of                                 the bill of rights in there in Britain                                 and so it's its preferred approach now                                 to try and actually limit the spread of                                 information was simply to tax newspapers                                 and tax paper and the idea was that this                                 would keep information out of the hands                                 of the of the really poor and terrible                                 people who couldn't be trusted for some                                 reason and so there was a tax on paper                                 and there was a stamp tax that was                                 introduced in America in                                                 this and is required that printed                                 materials in the colonies be produced on                                 stamped paper from London and of course                                 this led to complaints about taxation                                 without representation you may be                                 familiar with the stamp tax was so                                 unpopular that it was repealed after a                                 year but it was just one of the things                                 that irritated the the colonists in                                 America and Parliament in London still                                 insisted that it had the right to make                                 laws for the for the colonies that this                                 was ultimately what led to the American                                 Revolution now on the face of it taking                                 on the British Empire which the                                 colonists in America did was a really                                 dark thing to do because the British                                 Empire was the biggest military power in                                 history and they thought they could beat                                 it why did they why did they think they                                 could well it really didn't go very well                                 to start with the hostilities began in                                 April                                                                year things were looking pretty grim                                 most of the colonists in America were                                 probably on the fence at that point they                                 thought well we can't win maybe we                                 should arrange some sort of compromise                                 with the king will recognize him in some                                 form but we want a certain amount of                                 self-determination that was the kind of                                 mood in the winter and Tom Paine here we                                 see here was one of those who thought                                 this was wrong he said no we have the                                 chance to start all over again here we                                 should seize it we should say no to                                 hereditary monarchs we should go our own                                 way and he wrote a pamphlet called                                 common sense that argued this and he had                                 a foul                                 copper is a bit printed and he started                                 handing them to his friends and it                                 started to become available in the print                                 shop where it was printed on January the                                                                                                          connection and another a copy of it                                 reached George Washington and he read it                                 one sitting and he was so impressed he                                 showed it to his aides and he said this                                 is what we need to motivate everyone and                                 so he instituted the custom that the                                 offices in the colonial army all had to                                 get themselves a copy of common sense                                 and every evening they had to read it to                                  their men to inspire them there to read                                  bits of it and it's actually written                                  quite a sort of the mood of a of a                                  sermon and so between january and july                                                                                                          exposed to the ideas of Tom Paine this                                  was the nearest you could get to her to                                  a broadcast network but it was a                                  broadcast it was through social                                  connections again its social                                  distribution and this has an amazing                                  effect it rallied the colonists behind                                  the idea that they really should push                                  the breakaway from Britain and it turned                                  out that actually the British weren't is                                  stronger position as I would thought                                  they were the logistics of supporting                                  troops by sea was a complete nightmare                                  for the British they had to bring                                         soldiers had four thousand horses they                                  had to bring                                                                                                                                       for the horses and that's just the food                                  they also have to bring over weapons and                                  and boots and all that sort of thing in                                  ammunition and they had to supply                                  everything by sea because the army                                  couldn't live off the land because that                                  would alienate the local people and that                                  was just totally unsustainable and                                  ultimately the the British were unable                                  to build up sufficient supplies to                                  venture out of their camp and really                                  take on the rebels and whenever they                                  whenever they did have a defeat them in                                  a battle they were unable to really                                  follow through on it so ultimately                                  America became independent now there are                                  lots of other examples of social media                                  like I could have touched on but I I                                  hope I've given you sort of flavor of                                  what's going on here there is the                                  exchange of poetry in the Tudor and the                                  Stewart courts there's the handwritten                                  new sheets of pre-revolutionary France                                  which are particularly great fun but I                                  think you get the idea I am arguing that                                  there were many many conversational                                  media cultures social media culture                                  in history that are based on sharing                                  copying recommending commenting that                                  sort of thing and then what happened and                                  then it all went wrong why is this wrong                                  well it's wrong in the sense that this                                  is the first mass newspaper it's the new                                  york sun from                                                     newspaper launched newspapers in america                                  crossed six cents and this newspaper                                  cost one cent and it was based on a new                                  business model the steam press meant                                  that you could print lots of copies                                  really quickly and if you then sold them                                  at a low price which people could afford                                  because it was a sixth of the price of                                  other newspapers then you'd attract a                                  big market which you could then sell to                                  advertisers who would subsidize the                                  printing costs of a much larger number                                  of copies so it's a switch from being                                  funded mostly by subscribers to mostly                                  by advertisement and it happens here                                  first at the time when the new york sun                                  launched in                                                        newspaper in America was the courier and                                  Enquirer and use paper based in New York                                  have a circulation of                                                  you've written blog posts to get more                                  hits than that so this is a very very                                  small newspaper and it is typical of                                  newspapers across America there are lots                                  of them and they're all very small and                                  very local and in fact most of the                                  content in them is written by local                                  people sending letters to the print                                  office and it all just gets put together                                  there aren't professional reporters it's                                  a very different model this thing                                  changes the model it had a lot of crime                                  news had a lot of cetacean this stuff it                                  had much bigger circulation and it                                  introduced this idea of mass media                                  within a couple of years it was selling                                  tens of thousands of copies and you know                                  it was up to                                                          maybe it was incredibly fast other                                  newspapers copied this model and what                                  happens here is that you end up with a                                  newspaper where a small group of people                                  the journalists like me and decide what                                  goes into it and gather the information                                  and filter it and then you have this                                  distribution system that pushes it out a                                  media becomes a one-way push thing stops                                  being to weigh in conversational turns                                  into a one-way medium and the radio TV                                  go even further in this direction                                  you know with radio TV it's really                                  expensive to build the towers to cover                                  the whole country so you have this                                  concentration of who controls the                                  message into an even smaller group of                                  hands and this gave us the era of mass                                  media now the troubles we see in the                                  news industry now are essentially down                                  to the fact that it relied on this model                                  it became much too reliant on                                  advertising revenue American newspapers                                  in                                                                    percent of their revenue from                                  advertising the equivalent in Europe is                                  about fifty percent and summit some                                  publications it's as low as thirty                                  percent eighty-seven percent means are                                  really really exposed to advertisers and                                  to changes in the market so it's because                                  they had this model they were very                                  successful but it's now broken and why                                  is it broken is broken because of the                                  internet the Internet in particular                                  social media social transmission on the                                  internet has undermined this vertical                                  transmission model the internet is                                  stealing attention from TV it's stealing                                  attention from newspapers it's stealing                                  advertising dollars it's reinvigorated                                  horizontal transmission and once again                                  information could travel between people                                  whether it's a rumor or silly YouTube                                  video or actually important news like                                  Tripoli has fallen this is a big shift                                  absolutely but it's not entirely                                  unprecedented in many ways it's a return                                  to the way the world looked before                                       so today we see social media being used                                  as an accelerant in the Arab Spring I'd                                  it that you could say it's caused the                                  Arab Spring but it certainly hasn't done                                  it any harm we see governments try to                                  shut down the internet or shut it down                                  or use it to their own ends to suppress                                  dissent we see politicians worrying that                                  the internet can't be trusted because it                                  spreads lies and rumors we see companies                                  embarrassed by information that they'd                                  rather keep quiet coming out on the                                  internet we see Twitter used to                                  circumvent restrictions of free speech                                  like super injunctions over footballers                                  private lives and this is just what we                                  should expect because history tells us                                  that social media is extremely powerful                                  it challenges Authority it promotes                                  freedom of expression it promotes                                  collaboration and innovation and it                                  encourages political freedom in turn so                                  it's not a fad it's not going away it's                                  an idea with a very very long tradition                                  so I should probably make a couple of                                  predictions well I think on the                                  political front we can expect social                                  media to play a                                  all an important role in political                                  change in China we can already see early                                  stirrings to this effect particularly                                  after the recent high speed rail crash                                  it's very hard to censor social media                                  the volumes are very high the Chinese                                  language means you can actually pack a                                  lot into                                                            actually have whole paragraphs and of                                  course it's ideal for the phone based                                  internet culture that you have in China                                  in particular I think the internet will                                  also stimulate more innovation in                                  science and in business so we see some                                  very interesting web two point O social                                  experiments like the Zooniverse projects                                  I think they're wonderful doing that and                                  Marc Andreessen was recently talking to                                  The Economist and he remarked upon how                                  the international social media is                                  speeding up innovation in Silicon Valley                                  he says it makes the                                                      Stone Age so I think we're going to see                                  an impact there just as we saw                                  innovation in coffee houses in the                                        I think we're going to see these network                                  effects improving the speed of                                  innovation and then I think potentially                                  the Internet is a very very good place                                  for a new religion to gain traction now                                  there have a lot of recent new religions                                  well Scientology they've got a bit of a                                  problem with the openness part but                                  Christianity was a religion is a                                  religion based on sharing and openness                                  and spreading the spreading the word                                  literally so a religion that has                                  similarly enlightened view of the                                  internet could potentially could                                  potentially emerge in the coming                                  centuries as Jeff Jarvis said this week                                  it's only                                                              what he means is we're very early in the                                  era of the impact of the internet and                                  it's rather like the early days of the                                  printing press in the beginning of the                                  of the Reformation so what I've tried to                                  do bu today is put what you all do and                                  what I do into historical context and                                  from a long-term historical perspective                                  what we're basically doing is                                  contributing to the reawakening of the                                  social aspect of media which is laying                                  largely dormant for about                                               that's what you're doing when you're                                  writing code and when you're commenting                                  on things and sharing and so forth so I                                  hope that I've                                  succeeded in convincing you that social                                  media doesn't simply connect us to each                                  other today it also connects us to the                                  past thank you very much                                  ok                                  now I I should have mentioned at the                                  beginning I should have said at the                                  beginning there's a hashtag and I                                  believe diana is going to if there any                                  questions you posed on that hashtag we                                  might have time to answer a couple of                                  them I also should have said follow me                                  on Twitter anyway Diana do you want to                                  have we got time for a couple of                                  questions so this is Diana Dupree and                                  she actually works with us at the                                  economist and making our our site as                                  wonderful as it can possibly be what                                  have we got that's a great way to start                                  thank you so there was some interest in                                  social media as a profession or maybe                                  attempts to monetize it pre us so in                                  Roman area and Roman era yes um so well                                  the reason it wasn't a profession was                                  that a lot of the scribes were slaves so                                  you bought them and so but back                                  interestingly interestingly it was a                                  route to freedom it was a route to                                  becoming a freed man so tyro who is                                  Cicero's slave is initially his slave                                  and he is this amazingly good scribe and                                  he can you know he can he can write on a                                  wax tablet looks like an iPad as quickly                                  as Cicero can speak and then                                  reconstructed all afterwards and so                                  Cicero values him a great deal and                                  actually frees him part of the way                                  through his service and tyro loves                                  working with Cicero so much that he                                  continues to work with Cicero you know                                  as his secretary and so he continues to                                  do it so in that sense you know he made                                  it he made a career out of it and there                                  are other examples we can see of                                  entrepreneurs so in the case of when                                  Cicero goes to Syria and he has the news                                  sent to him from Rome he asks his                                  protege Kylie us to do this and Kylie                                  are actually outsources it to a Greek                                  scribe called Chrestus and cresta seems                                  to have made a living copying down the                                  the rumors from the forum and the the                                  news sheet of the forum and sending them                                  to paying subscribers so there were                                  people who were you know doing the job                                  of filtering curating and you know if                                  you couldn't be bothered to read all of                                  the stuff that was out there you could                                  pay someone to do it for you and that's                                  kind of you know I think that's the role                                  of the mass media now that's what we do                                  at the Economist we                                  I like to say sift crunch Pak so we we                                  try and work out what's important each                                  week and wrap it all up in a bundle you                                  can actually finish you can actually get                                  to the end of it unlike Twitter or the                                  internet and for some people you know                                  that's a particularly time press people                                  that's something they're they're really                                  willing to pay for someone tweeted about                                  how excited they were to be combining                                  their history degree with Drupal and now                                  you know how to do it can you recommend                                  further reading that people who are                                  interested in exploring this more um                                  well there isn't a book about this and I                                  think there should be so I'm writing it                                  so my plan is because I wrote it I wrote                                  this book the Victorian internet which                                  was about how Telegraph's were just like                                  the internet and I wrote that in                                       average at                                                               in the web one point                                                 thing that's changed about the internet                                  since then is that is the                                                so I really want to kind of go back and                                  revisit it so this is is essentially the                                  precis of the book which I'm supposed to                                  finish writing by the middle of next                                  year and should be out late next year or                                  the year after and my working title is                                  Cicero's web so i hope you will look out                                  for it and i hope that it doesn't differ                                  to strikingly for what i just said thank                                  you we can say we were there at the                                  beginning you can so last question was                                  early on in the thomas paine error was                                  there the same kind of differences                                  between media created in the private                                  interest versus the public interest or                                  from perhaps a group that had an agenda                                  in media yeah I'm if you look at and I                                  recently did a special report on this in                                  the Economist on the news industry in                                  particular if you look at the early news                                  industry so essentially it's from the                                  coffeehouse here onwards up to                                           ad in fact for much of the                                               it's incredibly partisan so in a sense                                  what Fox News or whatever MSNBC do now                                  and what the newspapers in Europe which                                  tend to have pretty you know they tend                                  to be pretty open about their political                                  biases you know the Guardian is a                                  left-wing paper and the Telegraph is a                                  right-wing paper we                                  seeing a return of partisanship to to                                  media particularly in America which has                                  tried to get away from it but actually                                  again in a sense that's a return to the                                  way things used to be and so that means                                  that yes it makes it harder to figure                                  out what's going on but that's what                                  everyone had to deal with those days I                                  talked to the creator of google news                                  about this and he said well the internet                                  makes it easier to synthesize multiple                                  points of view and figure out for                                  yourself what's going on and that's                                  really the skill that we need to                                  inculcate into people you shouldn't                                  believe anyone you should go and test                                  what they say against the evidence and                                  you should subject yourself to as many                                  points of view as possible and that was                                  John Milton's point and it's still true                                  today so the idea that i know that you                                  know some people think this is this is a                                  this represents decline of the modern                                  media but it's really a return to the                                  the way things were historically in fact                                  you wouldn't believe how how partisan                                  the newspapers of the the revolutionary                                  and the post the post-revolutionary area                                  as well were there's a good book on that                                  called infamous scribblers if you want                                  to know more about that period in                                  particular well thank you very much and                                  thank you for attending thank you very                                  much
