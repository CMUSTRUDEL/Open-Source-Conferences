Title: DrupalCon London 2011: KEYNOTE: DESIGNING THE SUSTAINABLE WEB
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	The web is evolving. Fast. As designers and developers working in this volatile medium -- one that is characterised by a relentless pace of change -- we need to consider strategies that deliver a sustainable web that exists beyond the here and now.

This keynote will focus on how, by marrying fundamental web standards with timeless design principles, we can create beautifully designed user experiences that embrace the full range of emerging technologies at our disposal. HTML5 and CSS3 offer today's designers and developers a platform on which to build sustainable web presences for tomorrow. In short, to create a sustainable web - one that exists across a growing number of devices - that is designed not with short term goals in mind, but that is built from the ground up with longevity as its driving force.

We discuss how a standards based approach that is forward looking, whilst embracing classic design principles, can ensure wonderful user experiences that exist outside of the latest trends and live on in our users' imaginations.

We both believe great design and enhanced user experiences go hand in hand:

1. Build a solid platform, embracing emerging standards, ensuring maintainability moving forward is pain free;
2. Apply fundamental and timeless design principles to ensure wonderful user experiences, experiences that exist outside of the latest trends and ensure a longer shelf life; and
3. Deliver efficiencies (via 1) and marketability (via 2) to satisfy the business people.

 

The Web Standardistas


In addition to their role as The Standardistas, Christopher Murphy and Nicklas Persson teach interactive design at the University of Ulster at Belfast, where they have been active in promoting a web standards-based curriculum.

As tweed-clad duo The Standardistas, they write regularly on standards-based web design and the importance of improving web design education. Their first book, which extols the virtues of A Web Standardistas' Approach, has received widespread praise for its practical and hands-on modus operandi. In addition to this they have been invited to write for, amongst other publications: 24 Ways (http://j.mp/startonpaper), The Manual (http://j.mp/designingthemind), and .net magazine.

In addition to speaking regularly at conferences worldwide, they run workshops and masterclasses, teaching the principles of design, both on and off the screen.

for you later or a wooden business                                card perhaps holy Drupal we hope you all                                survived your close encounter with                                Batman last night and aren't feeling too                                fragile so the standard Easter's                                approach we we like to kind of give                                things out and encourage some audience                                participation so we've got some badges                                that we throw at you and books as well                                we don't all the rows about because it                                might injure you when we throw this                                stuff if it hits you in the eye and                                takes out your eye that's entirely your                                fault because you're participating in                                this game show thing that we're running                                so what we'll be covering today first of                                all we're going to start off by                                surveying the landscape that we're in                                find ourselves in at the moment and then                                we're going to reveal and this is the                                exciting part this secret formula and                                that's a trademark thing so don't don't                                take that from us and the markup and                                assign timelines is the next thing we're                                going through and then we're closing on                                a marriage made in heaven and will                                become clear as we go along so because                                we're lecturers so we teach this kind of                                stuff and we're very focused on                                standards we always like to introduce                                some books that form the backbone of the                                talk that we do and so we would highly                                recommend these three books which kind                                of tied together very neatly around what                                we're talking about today if you haven't                                read Jeremy Keith html                                         designers we'd recommend it very highly                                in fact all of the books that are book                                apart our publishing are fantastic and                                if you haven't got ethem or cots                                responsive design buy it now and                                somebody tweet that and say a book apart                                those guys are promoting your stuff                                because then they might give us more                                free stuff here's another great book                                this one is a much weightier tune than                                the html                                                               Miller Brockman's grid systems and we're                                going to come back to that shortly as                                well waiting waiting to or away any tone                                yeah I can never say that work a weighty                                tome and a weighty tomb and finally coif                                ends excellent ordering disorder which                                really ties those two things together it                                ties together the mark-up side of things                                and then the fundamental design                                principles grid systems side of things                                so we're going to talk about designing                                the sustainable web a lot of what we're                                talking about today in some respects                                echoes what Tom Standage was saying                                yesterday which is about learning from                                the past and looking to the Past for                                inspiration as we map our way to the                                future and although we don't go far as                                 back as the Greeks and the Romans so                                 surveying the landscape it's a landscape                                 that's undergoing a very rapid and quite                                 fundamental series of changes and its                                 changes to affect how we build we build                                 a how would design we design and one of                                 the big changes over the last sort of a                                 couple of years is the proliferation of                                 devices we're now kind of                                 you know we're no longer just consuming                                 the interwebs on the computer at our                                 desk and this kind of change is really                                 it's it's something that's kind of it                                 brings forward starting leap the sort of                                 stuff that we should have been thinking                                 about all along that we should be                                 designing stuff for any platform for any                                 device when we started back in the day                                 and we're children and there were just                                 desktops that's how we designed for the                                 web and it was great because we could                                 just focus on this one thing and then                                 there were also Pompey exes did anybody                                 have a palm TX oh yeah there's somebody                                 that also that's definitely worth it                                 here there was one over here I'm gonna                                 throw a badge and but now that landscape                                 has changed so we have phones we have                                 iPads or tablets touchpads anybody                                    pounds get them this weekend in Dixon's                                 we've got desktops we have netbooks and                                 laptops and we also still have those old                                 phones that my wife really likes she                                 still loves that old phone try to                                 persuade her to buy a new one but she's                                 not into it and when we bring that                                 together that becomes a very difficult                                 landscape for designing to deliver our                                 content to the web and it poses a number                                 of challenges so the context that we're                                 consuming the web is also changing used                                 to be that you could you had kind of a                                 connection to the internet it was faster                                 it was slow but what we're seeing in the                                 last couple of years is that you're                                 consuming the web just kind of really                                 anywhere you no longer just on the desk                                 you kind of standing at the bus waiting                                 for a bus and yeah one would be waiting                                 for a bus if they were standing where                                 the year of us and so we consume the web                                 on desktops and and that that's a type                                 of content that we tend to go deeper                                 into maybe we sit down and read longer                                 but we also consumed the web when we're                                 out and about and that that requires us                                 to think about what we deliver to people                                 because they're in a different context                                 and the kind of stuff that you're                                 delivering to them needs to shift                                 slightly one of the main things that we                                 need to think about it there in that in                                 that regard it's not just kind of screen                                 sizes and so forth but it's also kind of                                 a bandwidth issue how fast is your                                 connection you're out and anywhere in                                 croydon is going to be extraordinarily                                 slow because there's only edge but so it                                 depends on where you are and that's kind                                 of that's that's something that we need                                 to bear in mind in the design of what we                                 do and how and where we consume the web                                 is changing as well as designers and                                 developers we need to evolve to to meet                                 these challenges we Timeship content to                                 read it later so we use Instapaper or                                 readability for example where we present                                 contact content in environments that are                                 less distracting where advertising has                                 been masked like the safaris reader or                                 for example and we need to consider                                 these changes in our markup and design                                 so we might start reading something at                                 home on a computer or maybe at work                                 because we can't afford one at home and                                 then we might shift that content to our                                 phone to read later while we're waiting                                 for the bus that Nicholas mentioned                                 gutbuster yeah that bus and then we                                 might pick it up when we get home on a                                 tablet and then we may even print it out                                 to give to our granny because she                                 doesn't have a just know what a computer                                 is and she doesn't have one and so we                                 need to think about how we mark up our                                 content for all of these different                                 devices because that's where it's being                                 consumed so how do we confront this and                                 the challenges that we've seen their not                                 inconsiderable so at the core what we                                 need to think about is creating a                                 sustainable web ad with content of                                 hustling javadi and our kind of recipe                                 for how to kind of make that happen is a                                 thoughtful combination of beautifully                                 crafted markup coupled with classic                                 design principles and that's what we                                 like to call                                 secret formula TM TM has been around for                                 some time the secret formula and it's                                 available by looking back at our history                                 in much the same way that Tom Standage                                 mentioned yesterday the secret formula                                 isn't about sprinkles although sprinkles                                 used to judiciously that's a really hard                                 word to say judiciously over should our                                 ups are easier of the equation and great                                 design is not about sprinkling from the                                 top it's about building from the bottom                                 up but we believe you can use sprinkles                                 as well so when we kind of think about                                 the sign all too often we're kind of                                 looking at superficial elements and                                 we're looking at sort of CSS galleries                                 and seeing that these are the latest                                 kind of trends that we should be                                 employing the deploying in their designs                                 but usually they're kind of relied on as                                 a crutch in this sort of the sprinkles                                 become the fundament of what we're doing                                 and what we should be doing is we should                                 be thinking of these sprinkles as kind                                 of icing on the cake and they're not the                                 cake itself and we'll show in a minute                                 how we can we think we can make a better                                 cake but first we have a look of some                                 sprinkles so we take a simple button for                                 example a basic CSS box with some text                                 and try and improve it we might soften                                 it up by adding a little border radius                                 we might add a little noise which gives                                 a sense of the real world and if you                                 haven't read anything by Mike rundle fly                                 assa t go and take a look at at                                 philosophy on Twitter he's got a really                                 great post about how we can learn from                                 how light interacts in the real world                                 and we can use that in our design and we                                 could add a gradient to give a sense of                                 depth the highlight love highlights                                 there's a little text shadow to make it                                 hard to see on that screen it's okay I                                 can see it from here it's good and we                                 might also introduce some kind of                                 transition or something when maybe                                 somebody use a user interacts with that                                 and giving them feedback so the end                                 result is that you got a button that's                                 got a little bit more depth and it's you                                 know a little bit of a richer experience                                 than the one at the top and it's a                                 better designed more satisfying to click                                 on and all that kind of stuff of course                                 it is and the rounded corner and the                                 noise and the gradient and the text                                 shadow and the transitions they kind of                                 add up to that little extra something                                 that kind of shows that you care about                                 your design but there's fundamental                                 principles that must come before this                                 and this kind of design principle it is                                 kind of like that's the sprinkles on top                                 we believe the web design for the web                                 great design for the web goes great a                                 lot deeper it's about building from the                                 ground up baking this cake the right way                                 and then adding that sprinkle stuff that                                 we just ran through at the end and not                                 running through it the other way around                                 so we believe in hierarchy getting a                                 good information hierarchy composition                                 thinking about how we lay out a page and                                 how that might change in different                                 contexts typography we can use much more                                 in the way of typography now on the web                                 thanks to type kit and font deck and                                 services like that semantics stuff that                                 was back in nineteen ninety device                                 independence thinking about not not                                 designing for one specific context but                                 designing for lots of contexts and then                                 openness designing something that's                                 non-proprietary so here's an example of                                 hierarchy and we can use a number of                                 factors to determine kind of the                                 relative hierarchy of the elements on                                 the page size weight and position will                                 help to establish a visual hierarchy                                 that can inform the design in a really                                 timeless benefits it's kind of it's it's                                 it's not doesn't have to be kind of                                 rocket science it's really quite simple                                 stuff if you just know the rules and                                 and deploy them this also we're going to                                 look at shortly you can use color as                                 well in establishing the hierarchy of                                 page we can also learn about composition                                 that we can learn from the history of                                 the printed page as will show shortly                                 yes the web is different and as we've                                 seen it is very malleable but the best                                 grid systems deal with ratios and                                 systems and those ratios and systems can                                 be applied in a non fixed environment a                                 solid grounding in grid systems can be                                 learned from the world of print we                                 believe in applied to the web you only                                 need to look at moulton for example to                                 see a designer who's really really using                                 grid systems effectively and typography                                 is another kind of real learn about                                 typography learn the basics and learn                                 kind of book just just read about                                 typography and find out and what are the                                 kind of classic secrets that have been                                 deployed for you know the last couple of                                 hundred years and there's a lot of stuff                                 that we can just directly take and use                                 on the web and now with this sort of                                 with the services that allow you to use                                 more than the kind of core web fonts                                 there's it's all the more important to                                 keep the kind of typographic rules in                                 mind when you're putting your stuff on                                 your pages so those are three elements                                 that we believe are fundamentals from                                 the design side of the equation but we                                 also feel there are three elements from                                 the markup side of the equation there is                                 semantics obviously there are semantics                                 would it be there are semantics think so                                 possibly there are semantics and html                                  offices a number of new semantic                                 elements that we can add further meaning                                 to our markup and by adding that new                                 meaning we can ensure our content is                                 better read by both humans and machines                                 the device independence we've touched on                                 this before with mobile devices being                                 kind of so widely used we have started                                 to realize that we really need to                                 consider the device independence but it                                 wasn't quite a founding principle of the                                 web it was                                 when it was first created to be able to                                 run your pages on any platform any                                 device was kind of one of the real                                 founding principles and we're kind of                                 coming back remembering a thought that                                 was always the case and we're also                                 really lucky working in this environment                                 I'm sure everybody here learned to do                                 what they do by using view source we are                                 in an open context when we design using                                 HTML and CSS and with that enables us to                                 learn from others and to share and for                                 us all to build collectively and yes no                                 this is new in fact all of this is old                                 and in the Sian terms the principles are                                 fundamental principles going right back                                 to sort of the days of Gutenberg on and                                 beyond or it's beyond when it's in the                                 past the opposite of beyond I say you're                                 saying he was called beyond Gutenberg                                 like be on board the tennis player um                                 his name is no Fiona his name is Beorn                                 I'll sorry he's Swedish yeah so in                                 workup assertion markup terms the                                 principles all date back from but                                      when mr. berners-lee invented a www so                                 we're not going to take a look at the                                 history that we can draw on to make our                                 lives as designers and developers a                                 little bit easier so we'd like to                                 present to you the iceberg metaphor this                                 is also TM as well don't be stealin that                                 one that's worth money so ultra often                                 where is obsessed with what's either                                 above the water or below the water                                 however we need to be obsessed with both                                 to create great designs that last it's                                 not just about markup it's about design                                 as well and as true craftspeople for the                                 web we need to care about what's above                                 the water and what's below the water                                 more govern design have evolved and they                                 continue to evolve and by looking and                                 learning from the past we can pave the                                 waste to the future now we've taken                                 liberties with gravity here on this next                                 slide and we also have a transition that                                 we apologize for in advance                                 so our iceberg is not the classic ten                                 percent above the water and ninety                                 percent below the water it's it's a                                 fifty-fifty type of iceberg and so we're                                 going to look at this in to house we're                                 going to look first at the under the                                 water bit and then we'll look at the                                 above the word of it we're gonna sorry                                 we're starting with the markup timeline                                 and we're going to try to bear in mind                                 the three core themes from a previous                                 slide semantics device independence and                                 openness so the markup layer is the                                 bottom half of our                                                  let's trade mark that as well                                      iceberg                                                                it's human nature to see everything we                                 do as being in the here and now but                                 markup is in fact evolved over time                                 though it has developed it has a                                 fundamental level remained the same so                                 let's rewind                                                                                                                                  at the very first web page and we'll see                                 that in essence nothing has                                 fundamentally changed over the last                                    years and what we're looking at here is                                 the very first web page it might not                                 look like much but this simple page                                 fundamentally changed everything it was                                 the realization of almost half a                                 century's thought in                                                   bit like Tom Standage because we've got                                                                                                        of proto hypertext memory index in                                      Ted Nelson coined the word hypertext                                 however it wasn't until nineteen ninety                                 that Tim berners-lee came along and                                 realized these visions and made this                                 real and it completely changed everybody                                 in this room's lives and also everybody                                 around the world so here we go the                                 looking at this markup you can see that                                 it's pretty much um it's very much like                                 the mark-up you see today there's some                                 body and head elements missing                                 there's some unquoted a GF nothing there                                 but it looks pretty much looks like                                 html                                                             different is the point and if we                                 fast-forward just                                                     staggering amount of progress in                                         the web page we saw in the previous site                                 have been expanded out to encompass a                                 whole bunch more semantic meaning and                                 many of the elements that we know and                                 love today were created back then that's                                                                                                       changed this markup still works even                                 better it's semantics it's device                                 independent and it's open it works on                                 different operating systems different                                 platforms different hardware different                                 software and that was the purpose of the                                 web to connect people so this is one of                                 the fundamental principles of the web                                 and we think that's a big deal so we're                                 into competition time and because i'm                                 from north Belfast I'm going to throw                                 these into the audience be able to reach                                 kind of the far end of the auditorium                                 I'm sure and on your crow can I get like                                 a couple the through ok you can get a                                 couple fine you get to and I get three

branding subtle                                 branding going on there Oh No finally                                 this one awesome yes fantastic that's                                 like a lot

linked here we know and love so by                                 its very nature the web was cross                                 browser and it was also responsive so if                                 we scale a page down it was responsive                                 design and we're talking a lot about                                 responsive design now partly because of                                 people like Ethel marcotte but we've                                 we've actually been able to do                                 responsive design for a while so we're                                 fast forwarding to the year                                             had Tim berners-lee in                                                going to take mr. selman to represent                                 kind of what was happening around                                    years later about                                                     all know story the web standards project                                 and he kind of realigned things and it                                 was taking things back to where they                                 were always kind of meant to be moving                                 away from proprietary markup towards                                 non-proprietary open standards so he led                                 the web standards project between                                      and                                                                      a book competition okay guys we have a                                 book prize coming up anybody who can                                 name the person who was leading the web                                 standards project right before mr.                                 Salvin                                                                   know that off the top of that they all                                 have computers come on it's going to be                                 like poop no no                                 no Fred John strategy you said George                                 you said George it's actually george                                 olson                                                                  of applause and we signed it as well so                                 it's gonna be worth money there was                                 basically cheating though because you                                 just ran through a whole bunch of names                                 it's the best way so mr. Zelman got us                                 back on track because of things like                                 this and remember isn't it great we love                                 animated gifts this this is basically                                 the web as it was in the late                                            remember what it looked like and what it                                 felt like it felt like this dancing baby                                 and I think if I did a bit of that I                                 might lose a bit of weight yeah you're                                 wearing the same underwear as well we                                 kind of have got a little bit distracted                                 because what happened was that browser                                 maker started to kind of make more and                                 more features available and it was a                                 kind of a rapidly evolving landscape and                                 we kind of forgot about using the                                 mark-up the way it was intended and                                 tables were starting to be used for                                 layout purposes which was never kind of                                 in tennis everything just kind of                                 account became a little bit hacky and                                 what Selden was trying to do and kind of                                 the cohort was to bring things back                                 towards the semantics who was that oh                                 sorry we'll move the baby people are                                 like having a epileptic fits and stuff                                 like that sorry ma Mystere apologies to                                 any epileptics in the audience and so                                 what the wasps promoted which mr. Zelman                                 as we said before lead was a return to                                 market as it was always intended goodbye                                 markup abuse hello again semantics using                                 elements for what they were intended and                                 the web standards project evolved to                                 lobby for HTML for XML one CSS one and                                 two an officially recognized dom and                                 non-proprietary javascript but what was                                 really important about this time as well                                 was that people started together it come                                 together as a team and try and help each                                 other out so we have sites like blue                                 robot so the community was starting to                                 kind of pull together and basically                                 create resources                                 for each other so that we can all start                                 making kind of our own personal blogs or                                 sites using this newfangled technology                                 CSS for presentation HTML                                               and there was kind of a real sort of                                 growth of these kind of like small ish                                 sites using this kind of this new better                                 way of doing things but it was still                                 kind of it's just a sort of you know web                                 designers doing it kind of to show their                                 friends how cool they were it's a little                                 bit like html                                                         however at a real tipping point when                                 under Douglas boomin wired redesigned                                 using CSS and XHTML one and if a                                 high-traffic website like wired could do                                 it then what was stopping the rest of us                                 from adopting this new standards based                                 approach and we're going to read out a                                 little bit of a longest quote here from                                 Douglas Bowman because it's kind of                                 interesting to hear how this resonates                                 today is a well you read that quote I'm                                 just going to drink some water we drink                                 cool go for it by converting to the                                 hybrid markup language XHTML and                                 adopting cascading style sheets wired                                 news is now faster to load and can be                                 read by practically every version of                                 every web browser it can be displayed on                                 the wider range of browser platforms                                 including mobile phones PDAs and                                 televisions so it's basically exactly                                 what we were talking about with device                                 independence openness all that kind of                                 stuff so it's kind of it's just been                                 evolving from nineteen ninety two                                 thousand until today when Dave Shea                                 launched the CSS n garden in                                         then started to show all of us the                                 possibilities of what could be done when                                 we truly separated content and                                 presentation and what was interesting I                                 think before we click the next slide                                 because they fade through about this                                 time was the number of people who all                                 were contributing to something and there                                 was a sense of community so we have Dave                                 shade designing something we have Andy                                 Clark John tan                                 dan Rubin and Douglas Bowman who we                                 showed you the wired site earlier this                                 is just a handful of examples of                                 designers and developers who are kind of                                 trying to move the web forward and gonna                                 move fast forward fast forward another                                                                                                     layouts and the separation of content                                 and style and behavior is accepted                                 practice that's what we do now it's a                                 natural thing and the initiative                                 instigated by wasp and others have can                                 essentially one and structure                                 presentation and behavior is now kind of                                 that stats are focused that's how we do                                 things and so we all know we're all                                 ruled over by the overlord mr. chairman                                 hixson mr. chairman mr. chairman hixson                                 yeah mr. chairman firstly chairman if                                 you draw a line from                                                    there is a clear evolution what html                                  does this evolve our markup layer and                                 enhance it for the future it offers a                                 richer semantic vocabulary including new                                 elements which allow us as designers and                                 developers to leverage our content in                                 much more exciting ways and the w                                        has kind of identified html                                             true path moving forward and even more                                 excitingly there's a fancy logo but it's                                 not just a fancy new superhero barge                                 html                                                                    none new semantics amongst other aspects                                 which allow us to create                                 device-independent open markup but lasts                                 it's about semantics we talk a lot about                                 this when we when we're teaching that                                 hTML is a design element you know we're                                 doing some design when we've done that                                 face we're not doing design once we've                                 done once we do get into the CSS side of                                 things we are but but the HTML is also a                                 big part of that as well and we need to                                 read everything first and look for                                 meaning and we can use html                                        semantic elements to add more meaning to                                 the market that we create so we have a                                 bunch of these new elements which allow                                 us to do exciting things and make markup                                 that we                                 it's better for both humans and machines                                 and going back to the quote which I'm                                 sure you remember because it was only                                 like a couple of minutes ago the thing                                 that Douglas woman was saying in                                      about faster to load being read by                                 practically every version of every web                                 browser displayed on a wide range                                 devices and also kind of you know it's                                 being able to not just kind of humans                                 but also computers will have a better                                 understanding of the markup that we're                                 producing so it's been an evolution if                                 we return to this timeline and we look                                 at the start and the finish will see                                 that markup is evolving and this is on a                                 continuum and we can learn from points                                 on that continuum so we take two points                                 on the continuum that's the web page                                    days after mr. berners-lee Sir Tim                                 berners-lee I thinking Lord earnestly                                 King berners-lee maybe invented the                                 interwebs and this was responsive design                                 and then if we look fast forward to                                                                                                    relaunched personal site which we show                                 later this is also responsive design so                                 actually though a lot has changed a lot                                 has remained the same and we can learn                                 by looking back to to the past so going                                 to move over to the assigned timeline                                 and their three themes that we're                                 bearing in mind those hierarchy                                 composition and typography and I think                                 we've got a                                                            well so we do let's look at the design                                 layer and again we take a timeline here                                 and we look to the past and see how                                 things have evolved and changed if we go                                 back to nineteen twenty-eight designer                                 yansh ish called an undisputed master of                                 typography published a book called died                                 annoyed typography saria to the germans                                 and the audience because that probably                                 sounds really really bad and his work                                 emphasized a clean and systematic                                 approach to design and his emphasis on                                 systems and how we build systems for                                 content can still inform what we do                                 today                                 so the design which is really kind of                                 off the time it's bold and it's                                 beautiful minimal design really striking                                 and it exists kind of outside of time                                 and it really isn't sort of about the                                 kind of                                                                 longevity and looking at this you can't                                 really sort of place it in nineteen                                 twenty nineteen forty nine seventy and                                 and his style which is a really rigorous                                 systematic approach has proven hugely                                 influential for designers for almost a                                 century and we can still learn from                                 looking at the principles behind this                                 and I think you're also reducing the                                 palette as well actually because the                                 next slide has two colors but this                                 really only has one because the yellow                                 is a ground you know this is really                                 powerful time standing the test of time                                 design just black red and some judicious                                 use of composition and this has a sense                                 of timelessness and also that guy has a                                 really great mustache as well so we had                                 to put that slide in because look he                                 also has a great massage                                 oh please remove the video oh can you                                 guys do that can we get the video off                                 because somebody wants to take a                                 photograph and get the whole mastani and                                 with the mustache yeah look at that can                                 you get a badge thrown all the way up                                 there and we take a look at this and                                 we're looking at things like the golden                                 section and fundamental composition                                 principles limited palettes simple clean                                 typography and these designs exist                                 outside of time or if we look at this a                                 four letter head and these instructions                                 that Trish gold has drawn up for how to                                 lay that out yeah it doesn't look the                                 similar to a web page and we can learn                                 from the systems and the rational                                 approach so what's really worth                                 emphasizing there is the rationale                                 systems that are kind of the underlying                                 core of the design and even if we're not                                 kind of doing a visual design of a page                                 thinking about those systems it's really                                 kind of a good lesson to learn in                                 anything that we do so if we                                 fast-forward                                                       emergence of the Swiss International                                 style and a huge figure in that is                                 Joseph Miller Brockman pioneer of his                                 craft he was born in nineteen fourteen                                 and studied architecture design and                                 history of art which i think is really                                 interesting mix and even after his death                                 in                                                                    influences people today and what we can                                 learn from this is systems systems                                 systems this is emphasizing that                                 underlying grids and it's a really well                                 children palette of color and type and                                 it's minimal but really quite rich at                                 the same time and if we look at like a                                 collage of posters together these all                                 have a timeless quality and they might                                 have been made                                                       still feel fresh and new today and we                                 can learn a lot from looking at this                                 hierarchy composition and typography                                 being this sort of underlying core                                 our essence does anybody have this book                                 oh yeah oh no more you can just your                                 personal but I can have to take my                                 personal badge off and give it to you                                 there you go okay keep going so young                                 man it's required reading it's a really                                 good book and its really systems focus                                 and it offers an insight into the signs                                 of grid systems and it's something that                                 we can just take and learn from an apply                                 straight to the web it's about I think                                                                                                        keep coming back to it's just full of so                                 much really good advice and he really is                                 a master of the grid system and we can                                 learn from this as we see in the in the                                 next set of slides and apply this type                                 of thinking the systematic approach to                                 the web so if we fast-forward                                            that's what a bunch of year                                          many years khoi khoi vinh whose book we                                 showed in there in the first few slides                                 he in many many ways ties together an                                 understanding of both markup and assign                                 an especially grid systems and together                                 with mark Coulton is another kind of                                 real strong kind of grid systems kind of                                 designer to making a compelling case for                                 the kind of rediscovery of grids and how                                 they might be applied to the web if we                                 look at the new york times website which                                 was redesigned by core even in                                          he is also at pains to stress that this                                 was not his redesign he led the team and                                 it was actually a group of people who                                 put this together it is under lived                                 underlying this is a solid grid system                                 and this is five years old and it still                                 looks fresh and contemporary today but                                 but it also is a high-traffic site with                                 a lot of content going through it and                                 content that you can't always predict                                 because it's the news                                 so there's a discordant personal site                                 and it's got a timeless quality it's                                 kind of moving beyond a sort of redesign                                 the portfolio site every year mentality                                 and sort of just going for what is kind                                 of trendy and popular at the moment and                                 goes back to something which is much                                 more fundamental and it also you know                                 he's not afraid to show you the grid                                 that is based upon just black and white                                 and then just an accent color of orange                                 for for when you interact with certain                                 parts the best thing about cojiendo i                                 think is that he built a website for his                                 dog I think that's nice so the book                                 ordering disorder is well worth getting                                 and it's kind of a primer on how grid                                 systems can be built and built into the                                 design process when we're designing for                                 the web so very good book yeah get it                                 we're not getting paid by any of these                                 people up or anything like that it                                 sounds like we're advertising maybe we                                 should we should have like an                                 advertising we've walk on with boards                                 and stuff yeah your revenue stream yeah                                 so we come back to the timeline again                                 and we look at                                                           have a piece of work by Joseph Miller                                 Brockman and in                                                          a blog post on the Typekit blog by frank                                 camaro on hierarchy in web typography                                 and if we look at these this piece from                                                                                                          clear hierarchy in terms of the type and                                 the information hierarchy in terms of                                 how that's marked up and we can almost                                 look at that and see mark up there                                 behind the scenes and then if we                                 fast-forward                                                        camaro on the type clip blog and what's                                 interesting I think about this is a lot                                 of people kind of go wow my god Frank                                 I'm your room this is just awesome and                                 it's                                 kind of all a lot of its really old so                                 we could kind of go back and look to the                                 past and we could learn a lot ourselves                                 if we look at those two side by side we                                 see that they are they're not really                                 that different okay yeah so let's try to                                 put these two halves of the equation                                 together and by marrying fundamental web                                 standards with timeless design                                 principles we can create beautiful                                 design user experiences that embrace the                                 full range of emerging technologies at                                 our disposal yeah but you didn't say                                 ebony and ivory I did not say openly                                 neither eats like happening and ivory                                 working together in perfect harmony                                 keyboard you not getting that yeah key                                 by key why don't we I don't know the                                 rest does i don't know the rest on so if                                 we go back to the the the                                               again and we start to look at these two                                 things put together which is a solid                                 fundamental layer of good good quality                                 considered beautifully crafted markup                                 and then a design layer that considers                                 typography hierarchy composition of the                                 fundamental things that we've just run                                 through we can see examples of sites                                 that put these things together that have                                 a timeless quality and are beautifully                                 designed so we're looking at hierarchy                                 composition typography semantics                                 thinking about device independence                                 thinking about the context in which                                 people will be seeing things and                                 starting to realize that they won't be                                 seeing them in the same context all the                                 time and that sometimes the same person                                 might be looking at the same piece of                                 context content in a variety of contexts                                 in                                                                  presentation layer the HTML was kind of                                 just there or and but you still had                                 pages that worked everywhere and there                                 were kind of with independent device                                 independent and so forth and what we've                                 been able to do in the last kind of                                    years is approaching a vision of how the                                 web was meant to be but it's now looking                                 great as well it's kind of a good thing                                 and one last one on that list is                                 openness as well                                 so if we take a look at mark Bolton's                                 site for five simple steps we can see                                 some of the things that we talked about                                 earlier on we have a solid information                                 hierarchy in terms of the way this                                 information is presented and then                                 there's this there's even a system in                                 terms of how those book covers are                                 designed so every cover gets its own                                 color and is always in a different                                 typeface and it's always set at the same                                 point in terms of composition except for                                 Andy Clark he wants his own cover I feel                                 pain about that Nicholas less so and we                                 were going to do a wraparound that was                                 just purple with type and then                                 distribute it free on the web but we                                 didn't really want to piss off Andy too                                 much so it's another ending we can't                                 piss off yeah let's stop it I'll just                                 stop right there Kyle mayor has said                                 does an excellent work for this year's                                 BUILD conference and it's a really great                                 web conference in Belfast you should all                                 go to it it sold out but maybe next year                                 and it combines the restrained color                                 palette with bold elegant typography and                                 has got that sort of timeless quality                                 it's really kind of using very simple                                 subtle methods kind of convey the                                 hierarchy of information and I think I                                 think another thing to point out about                                 this and we don't actually have this as                                 a slide but it's probably worth talking                                 about just for a second and is that                                 designing within it within tight                                 restraints like this doesn't mean to say                                 we can't have fun we can't make things                                 enjoyable and pleasurable has anybody                                 seen this site like hands Wang purse the                                 front the front we age we seen the front                                 page with the videos it's really really                                 nicely done where what they did was they                                 asked the speakers to shoot videos of                                 themselves and then they presented them                                 in black and white using the html                                        element and they have them all there so                                 they look like these static pictures of                                 Josh brewer but they're in fact people                                 just kind of sort of doing this and you                                 were asked to because we were speaking                                 at this you were asked just to kind of                                 stand                                 that's him standing still we could do I                                 was going that that was not having a                                 heart attack that was laughing but it's                                  a really nice idea because it works                                  within the context of a very simple                                  rational clean design and it's quite                                  playful and it's quite exciting this is                                  a good site great resource for                                  inspiration I'll one and it's antonio                                  parish sony thank you anything is how                                  you it's that's that's who it is i'm                                  just not sure how you pronounce that so                                  apologies to anyone who spanish or                                  something or portuguese sorry we got                                  that wrong possibly and if you click on                                  this little green thing in the top                                  corner this dashboard slides out which                                  is really beautiful and there's a lovely                                  user experiences that kind of slides in                                  and again we see evidence of a solid                                  underlying grid system a restrained use                                  of color and a strong hyper hierarchy in                                  terms of the type and the information of                                  how things are marked up and because                                  this is kind of a blog about the sign                                  it's really interesting to see it really                                  kind of strong ties with the work from                                  the                                                                      design of the site itself when you can                                  sort of see how the parallels are really                                  clearly there and it's all about                                  hierarchy and it's all about typography                                  and it's about kind of restraint well                                  it's a great blog I'll                                                    and he also I don't know when this guy                                  does any work actually because he's just                                  doing this all the time I think he also                                  set up a website called the grid system                                  which is fantastic and it gathers                                  together resources about grid systems                                  books you should read web articles                                  things like that and you can toggle the                                  grid on and off and what's really nice                                  about this is it's not just the vertical                                  grid that's been considered but it's                                  also the horizontal baseline grid as                                  well I a information architects she's a                                  bunch of guys from Japan or is it just                                  one guy I'm never quite sure but I mr.                                  Rickon Stein apologies to the Swiss                                  people and is from Switzerland okay Nona                                  rest of them are from Japan oh yes I'll                                  just as a Japanese people we haven't                                  done any Japanese names but this is a                                  really beautiful sight it's built on a                                  solid layer of html                                                    all of the new elements are our disposal                                  and it's also responsive so that as you                                  view it in different types of devices it                                  changes and their content reformats                                  itself to present itself to a way that                                  is more amenable to the context in which                                  you're looking at it so as we said under                                  the hood the mark-up is really                                  well-crafted as well and a semantic                                  using all the kind of new html                                            at our disposal so it doesn't just look                                  nice on the surface but don't you just                                  wet your pants a little when you see                                  beautifully crafted markup like that you                                  can go on you know so maybe we do this                                  too much maybe maybe were just wet our                                  pants too much that's why I'm wearing                                  those pants that the baby was wearing                                  it's a nappy actually yes I'm not                                  wearing an over showing no me asking                                  some recently Tom Standage talked about                                  that yesterday he didn't represent a she                                  recently launched her portfolio site of                                  responsive built in html                                           example here is just showing how you can                                  use kind of an asset that you have on                                  the page and display it in kind of                                  various ways depending on the device                                  with and so forth so those are actually                                  the same images just kind of like re                                  moved and scaled for something like an                                  iPhone whatever Android or or a droid or                                  it soon                                  soon with web access I don't know if                                  yeah and if we take a look at Simon                                  Collison's recently redesigned personal                                  site as well and it combines responsive                                  mark up with timeless design principles                                  and it has a functional long laugh                                  lasting sustainable type of web presence                                  and I think was interesting about this                                  is that you can look at the mullah                                  Brockman and the ranch ish cold and the                                  khoi vinh and think that they don't get                                  out much and go partying because they                                  only look at some serif typefaces and                                  look at line heights and things like                                  that and you can see that think do we                                  need to be constrained by this very                                  modernist very kind of a post-war type                                  of design style and you don't you know                                  this has got a very kind of victorian                                  type of flavor to it so we can still use                                  grid systems in an intelligent way but                                  in a design style that is slightly                                  different and again this is responsive                                  so if we look at this perhaps on a                                  tablet it reconfigures itself and then                                  if we look at it on a bone of some                                  advice as some device description some                                  description that was the word I was                                  looking for again so                                  functional and a real functional site                                  but also cycling on longevity here is                                  another example cognition which is happy                                  cogs blogs we're back to mr. Salvin                                  again or as we like to call him we                                  Jimmy's elders that's another name for                                  him yes and we got responsive design                                  here and it's also kind of an example of                                  showing the type of content that you                                  need to show for the specific for the                                  specific device if you're kind of                                  looking at it on your phone maybe that                                  illustration of the graveyard this                                  becomes unnecessary so just don't show                                  it and also a beautifully designed piece                                  a piece of work as well with a very                                  restrained color palette again you know                                  and showing what you can do and also                                  beautiful web typography and all of the                                  things that we've been talking about so                                  what did we cover and we started by                                  surveying the landscape and looking at                                  how the landscape that we designed for                                  now as web designers or web developers                                  has changed considerably when we started                                  doing this as a job it was it was                                  perhaps easier but the pace of change                                  moves on and we need to consider things                                  like the range of devices that a user                                  might be accessing our content on                                  knowing especially that the mobile web                                  is growing considerably and considering                                  how we deliver content that's                                  appropriate to those kinds of scenarios                                  and we need to think about the scenarios                                  in which people consume content I don't                                  know if anybody knows kenneth bowls he's                                  the guy with a really unpronounceable                                  first name spelt SI en NY BD or                                  something is good because there could                                  have pulled a gold-headed from Wales and                                  he did a great talk for us in Belfast                                  for our students where he talked about                                  desktop static type content where equal                                  desktop static content which is where                                  you maybe sit down and spend a lot of                                  time reading something so you want                                  something that's in depth and other                                  types of content which are more mobile                                  where you're standing in that bus queue                                  waiting for the bus and you maybe want                                  less of the content because you just                                  want to kind of quickly flick through                                  things and thinking about ways in which                                  you might show or hide certain                                  things or change the the way that the                                  amount of content that people consume                                  and then we looked at the ways in which                                  we can move from the desktop through to                                  say the phone through to say the tablet                                  for you to say the paper for our granny                                  so the secret formula I hope you all                                  wrote it down and it's okay you can you                                  can share it with people we're not going                                  to see you even though we have a TM                                  there the secret formula being classic                                  design principles and the fundamental                                  founding principles of the web is                                  keeping those in mind and making sure                                  that we are designing pages that are                                  that are your loss for words pages that                                  that stand the test of time that aren't                                  just in the now but also have a real                                  kind of underlying adherence to the core                                  principles of the web so we looked at                                  things like hierarchy composition                                  typography semantics device independence                                  openness and if we make a mix of all of                                  those things and we look back to the                                  past and and really look back at our                                  history and look at what we can learn                                  from that and transport into the into                                  the                                                                      design and make it more sustainable that                                  lasts forward into                                                     beyond as well so the markup and the                                  sign timelines show this in practice and                                  amounted to what we'd like to call a                                  marriage made in heaven and I think                                  that's probably the right time to pull                                  up our slide that says any questions I                                  think we're going to have somebody                                  coming out on stage enter left so there                                  we go look at that and thank you as well                                  for listening                                  thank you okay okay there been a few                                  tweeted questions and I just want to                                  start with one is typography related a                                  lot of people have been asking for some                                  practical sort of ways of applying some                                  of the stuff you've been talking about                                  and so particularly when it comes to                                  typography I was sort of thinking you                                  know other ways that we can actually                                  apply these principles like a mix of                                  serif fonts and non serif fonts between                                  headings and body text minimum steps in                                  sizes between headings and body weights                                  that goddess yet I'll take that one yeah                                  I think you could take a look at Tim                                  Brown I don't know if anybody knows Tim                                  Brown who's the type manager for a type                                  kit and not jet the heat before he said                                  took that role on he was doing nice                                  website calm and very in a very much in                                  the bright spirit of the openness thing                                  designing beautifully crafted pages                                  using rich web typography and then                                  explaining how on earth you had done                                  that and they're very he's taken that                                  passion which he had in his personal                                  blog through to type kit where they're                                  really heavily involved in getting                                  designers out there too and developers                                  as well obviously to look at some of the                                  technical issues and to look at some of                                  the design issues and they have written                                  fantastic posts on things like tight                                  pairing which typeface goes with another                                  typefaces and general principles for                                  that and Tim also spoke at BUILD                                  conference last year about a typographic                                  hierarchy tool he's been building which                                  is based on the golden ratio and he has                                  a website i can't remember off the top                                  of my head but if you send us a tweet                                  which is why that slowed is better if                                  you send us a tweet will dig it out more                                  sent you a link it's well worth reading                                  thank you you just mentioned his name                                  once more for everyone Tim Brown I don't                                  need to apologize because that's an                                  English name and it's really easy to say                                  cool okay um also someone asks what was                                  the grid book that you suggested Joseph                                  Miller Brockman it's called it's just                                  called grid systems and then raster                                  system in German sorry German people                                  great thank you and it's really i think                                  my book i bought mine for about                                          or something and I kind of felt real                                  pain when I gave that credit card over                                  intake modern and it's now only about                                     quid and it's just you know it's worth                                  its weight in gold what are your                                  feelings on the move away from kind of                                  stricter market requirements from tough                                  like strict HTML versus you no html                                   could this actually cause less adherence                                  to standards bearing in mind html                                      known to be a bit looser and more                                  relaxed I think that it's a very                                  interesting question it's something that                                  we kind of been rattling with when we                                  teach our kind of first and second year                                  students who are all aspiring web                                  designers when you had the kind of the                                  strictness of XHTML you could just say                                  no you're doing that wrong you need to                                  do it this way with html                                                do it this way but it's also okay to do                                  it a little bit looser and so forth and                                  when you're an established designer                                  developer and you have kind of started                                  writing your stuff in XHTML then the                                  natural progress is to keep on writing                                  it that way and you just change the                                  doctype and you kind of add the extra                                  semantic elements and that's kind of the                                  natural way to go but when you start out                                  and when you haven't actually done any                                  more cup before it becomes a little                                  trickier personally I like this sort of                                  vista kind of the strictness of the                                  XHTML and I would kind of I would say to                                  any of the students I would say that if                                  you do it this way then it's much easier                                  to figure out if something is going                                  wrong if you kind of if you neglect to                                  close your tags and all that kind of                                  stuff even though it's possible and even                                  if it's valid it's not good practice i                                  would say that it's it's a little bit                                  more of an open landscape and you have                                  more options but what you decide to do                                  at the end of the day it should be an                                  informed choice and i think we're kind                                  of also ask the community reaching a                                  maturity where where                                  where we kind of can be informed enough                                  to make that choice and so personally I                                  would say you know I like the strictness                                  and I'm going to continue writing markup                                  that way and I would kind of I would                                  give that advice to people yeah I think                                  in the next edition of the book that we                                  wrote which was really written for our                                  students to try and give them a solid                                  set of guidelines to follow and then                                  they've asked us to write another                                  edition in using html                                                  think we would stick with the strictness                                  because it's easier to teach I mean I                                  have a son who's                                                       it's easier to see ya easier to whatever                                  son he's thirteen and he should finish                                  the book over the summer because he                                  thinks he's going to get paid loads of                                  money as a web designer and where he got                                  that idea from and you know it's easier                                  to sit down and say well this way but                                  there's where that's gone wrong and when                                  you start to move towards looseness it                                  becomes harder to define that um yeah                                  like Leah gradually when it comes to                                  sort of new devices and there are new                                  input mechanisms and also you've been                                  talking about grids now grids obviously                                  were started in order to fit a space                                  that has physical bounds now the screen                                  doesn't really do that you know you can                                  use sliding mechanisms and you know                                  styluses and all sorts of stuff and it                                  doesn't really matter where you are on                                  the screen and I'm just interested you                                  know how do you apply grids to a space                                  that it actually has unlimited borders                                  in reality I think you can still apply                                  grids and have certain break points at                                  which you change your design to                                  something that's more suited to the                                  device that you're delivering it to that                                  doesn't mean that once you say go from                                  here down to here you just abandon grids                                  altogether you know you think of a grid                                  system that's appropriate to that                                  particular device and then you make                                  another break point perhaps for much                                  smaller mobile devices and again you                                  think of a good system for that I mean                                  that might be of one column grid but the                                  heart is understanding how that                                  information is working as you know in                                  terms of contextual e together another                                  thing is that your your measures that                                  not know                                  necessarily have to be kind of you know                                  millimeters or pixel-based they can be                                  kind of percentages or you know em units                                  they can be sort of there's a there's a                                  kind of a scale and a relative kind of                                  size of the elements on the page so the                                  grid could still be there it doesn't                                  have to be a fixed grid so you can still                                  apply the same principles but but you                                  start in a fluid or in a responsive                                  layout so okay that's all thank you very                                  much see it very much thank you as well                                  and talk to us over a beer afterwards                                  okay thank you thanks thanks guys
