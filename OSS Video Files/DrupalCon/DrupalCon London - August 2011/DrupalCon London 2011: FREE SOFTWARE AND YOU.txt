So you've taken the plunge into Drupal and you know that it's open source. But what does that mean in practice?

Free and Open Source Software means more than just no licensing costs. In fact, it doesn't technically even mean that. Open Source is both a development philosophy and a social philosophy that work together to build better software and better communities.

For example, by being licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) your contributions of to Drupal core and any contributed projects become parts of a "common good" that can be freely shared and re-used, but which cannot be turned into a closed-source product. This helps build trust and a sense of collaboration even if we work for companies that sometimes compete for clients.

This session will introduce the advantages of Open Source development models, and compare Open Source and proprietary consulting models both from the developer/consultant side and from the client side. That includes what it means to work in a trust-based economy rather than a fear-based economy.

We will cover the concepts and principles behind Free Software and Open Source Software, how those impact how code gets written (and what code gets written), and guidelines to keep in mind to maintain your or your business's standing as a good citizen of the open source community. In addition, we will touch briefly on how you may wish to make agreements or contracts with clients so that the work you perform can later benefit both you and the broader community.

Intended audience
This session is for themers, developers, consultants and anyone else in the Drupal community.

Questions answered by this session
What is the GPL and how is is diffent from some other licenses you may commonly see used in open source projects.

software is                               free the session is free while kids                               sessions not free my name is Larry                               garfield's i'm a developer with palantir                               net and this is peter roll Annan Peter                               introduction I'm on the engineering team                               with aquia and and Peter waylaid me into                                doing this presentation with him since                                i'm also on the board of directors for                                the drupal association dealing with                                legal matters neither of us is an                                attorney we just talked about it a lot                                so we'll put that caveat out there to                                start with before we actually get                                started let's have a quick poll here who                                here consider themselves primarily a                                developer okay who here is a consultant                                of some kind freelance consultant who                                here owns their own consulting shop of                                some kind who works for a large company                                that happens to use Drupal internally                                what are the rest of you do think we get                                everyone at least once yeah okay so free                                software what are we talking about so                                let's set the wayback machine for                                      computers are still you know big honking                                piles of expensive metal and any                                software on them pretty much has to be                                compiled for that machine if you have to                                provide software someone else you're                                providing them with source code for it                                because it doesn't work otherwise and                                they usually have to modify it to get it                                to work on a new piece of hardware                                anyway so in a sense all software is                                freely distributed because there's no                                value in it the values in the hardware                                and it doesn't occur to people to                                charged separately for the software                                because well it's useless without the                                hardware anyway that began to change in                                late                                                                have computers that could run software                                that wasn't custom compiled for that                                particular box and you quickly had a                                business model spring up of selling                                software licenses                                and selling software as if it were a                                product and this got kind of popular but                                also annoyed an awful lot of people                                especially people from academia who were                                used to the idea of just sharing                                information and one of the people that                                this really annoyed is a man named                                Richard Stallman who at the time and the                                early                                                                States and famous story he had a problem                                with his printer driver and as any good                                geek dug into the code and figured out                                the problem and made a fix for it and                                sent a patch back to the company and                                said I found a bug here's a fix for it                                and is it great thanks please sign this                                                                                                     not tell anyone about this bug and you                                will assign all copyright over to us and                                he said wha well why would I have to do                                that well how else are people going to                                get the code unless we give it to them                                and you've given us complete license to                                do so and he said well screw that i'll                                give it to them and you know you can go                                away and being a stubborn person he                                started the news not unix projects or                                new gnu being the world's first                                recursive acronym because Stallman has a                                very weird sense of humor basic idea                                being at this point most unix-like                                operating systems were proprietary                                expensive closed source you know all                                those things that he didn't like and so                                he founded the Free Software Foundation                                in                                                                 creating a completely free operating                                system from the ground up called renew                                now when we say free we're talking about                                fries and speech not free as in beer not                                that there's anything wrong with free                                beer remind you most of us rather like                                it but free in this case we're talking                                about liberty in non-english languages                                free is usually translated as libre or                                libre we're whatever language you're                                translating into and when we say free                                here we specifically are talking about                                these four criteria that the Free                                Software Foundation considers to be the                                 definition of free                                 in this case for our freedom there's                                 freedom                                                                  zero which is the freedom to just run a                                 program for any purpose whatever that                                 purpose is whether the person who wrote                                 the code morally proves of it or not it                                 you get to run the program to do                                 whatever it is you're going to do                                 freedom                                                                  change it to suit your needs the freedom                                 to share copies with others to help your                                 friends and the freedom to improve it                                 and to share those improvements with                                 others as well so that everyone benefits                                 not just you not just the original                                 developer but everyone benefits and I                                 usually like to re summarize these four                                 freedoms as the freedom to use learn                                 improve and share these are all really                                 nice concepts you know you do what you                                 want with these software let yourself                                 learn you know make the world a better                                 place share with your friends you know                                 this is what we tell our children is the                                 correct moral way to behave is share                                 your toys and free software is based on                                 that same concept it's morally correct                                 to share your toys and to this end the                                 Free Software Foundation published the                                 canoe general public license which is a                                 software license that's when you strip                                 away the legalese basically says here is                                 this code you have these four freedoms                                 from me on condition that if you                                 redistribute it to someone else if you                                 share someone else you give them the                                 same freedoms and that includes if you                                 have a modified version with cool new                                 features you share those features them                                 too so it's a share alike license and                                 that's basically the concept behind free                                 software and okay the Free Software                                 Foundation and a team of developers                                 started working on this completely free                                 operating system and by                                                 had almost everything you need for an                                 operating system except for a kernel                                 which handles the actual device drivers                                 it said okay almost there let's start                                 working on a kernel and then in                                      some finished student dumped a unix-like                                 colonel on the internet and said hi I've                                 got this little toy project that                                 probably won't go any                                 but i thought was fun to write and                                 people said hey this thing is great now                                 if only had the rest of the stuff to put                                 on top of a colonel hey look here's this                                 cool stuff that you can put on top of a                                 colonel that the canoe project is                                 written so now we've got this great                                 working Linux operating system and the                                 Free Software Foundation said no get                                 ninety percent of this code we wrote                                 it's canoe and so you'll find a lot of                                 people who'll say you know it's good new                                 linux versus linux it they lost that                                 fight just you'd call it linux and as we                                 might it's working yeah it is should be                                 okay i was gonna say one thing if you                                 look today the new project still has a                                 kernel underway call good new herd which                                 it has yet to actually they've been                                 writing it since about nineteen ninety                                 right it doesn't work yet so you have                                 this linux renew linux operating system                                 and application software on top of it                                 that was all distributed for free and                                 you know it as freedom software and but                                 they're still other stuff to do with                                 that software and there's still money to                                 be made there in services in training in                                 consulting and so forth and there are                                 companies that built a pretty decent                                 business model around this and over time                                 people observed is in particular a man                                 named eric raymond in his paper called                                 the Cathedral in the bazaar that you                                 know what this share like philosophy on                                 software it works really well for making                                 good code because when you're able to                                 collaborate and share code rather than                                 wasting effort competing with each other                                 and keeping things hidden you get a                                 better product out of it at the end at                                 the same time a lot of businesses were                                 really turned off by this word free and                                 you can blame the english language for                                 this completely i I'm saying this in                                 England so I'm not sure that their joke                                 would go over as well as it would in                                 Copenhagen and yet the idea of free                                 software turned off a lot of businesses                                 free for two that I want to charge money                                 you know so they coined the term open                                 source software to be more like a                                 business-friendly marketing version of                                 that                                 and you know the open source initiative                                 which is falling off the side of the                                 screen here I apologize for that coin                                 the term open source and find it this                                 way there's I think ten different points                                 here for what something has to it what a                                 license has to be to qualify is open                                 source and these are in fact slightly                                 different than free software in                                 particular you can have something that                                 is open source where you're allowed to                                 distribute the original code and your                                 changes as a separate patch but you're                                 not allowed to combine them that's legal                                 under open source definition not under                                 free software ninety-nine percent of the                                 time something's going to be both but                                 not always for more information on this                                 open source org the home with the Open                                 Source Initiative and I'm happy to say                                 it's a Drupal site and I'm not happy to                                 say it's still running garland but open                                 source is primarily a development model                                 that makes better code free software is                                 a philosophical model of sharing is the                                 right thing to do and of course this                                 pissed off this free software people                                 again because yeah if you're saying this                                 is morally correct then the fact that it                                 produces better code is beside the point                                 maybe it's true maybe it's not but                                 that's beside the point in practice both                                 are true in most cases I would argue and                                 in the case of a Drupal in particular                                 you get all of them Drupal is developed                                 an open-source fashion it is free                                 software it's under the gnu general                                 public license or GPL there's no cost                                 for it so it is free is in Drupal beer                                 we do in fact have our own Drupal beer                                 and free as in freedom so with that I'm                                 going to hand it over to Peter to talk a                                 bit more about the nitty gritty details                                 of you know what you should know about                                 free software licensing so thanks Larry                                 so that was kind of the history of how                                 these license developed where the free                                 software movement came from what I want                                 to talk about was a little bit more of a                                 practical approach so if you're a                                 developer your consultant your business                                 owner there's some things that that you                                 know we've sort of struggled to                                 communicate to people use Drupal                                 out what troop Eliza the drupal license                                 is how Drupal should be used how the                                 code should be shared and as we'll talk                                 about that you don't have to share the                                 code is an important point the most                                 important thing to sort of keep in mind                                 is a broad underlying principle is that                                 all software licenses are based on                                 copyright so if you write code generally                                 you own the copyright or your employer                                 owns the copyright and your permission                                 to use the code drives from that                                 copyright it's a license from the                                 copyright holder and if you go and buy                                 something like a Microsoft product some                                 other commercial software to run on your                                 machine you'll see what you're actually                                 buying is an end user license you're not                                 buying the software you're buying a                                 license to use the software on one                                 computer or two computers or whatever                                 the terms the license are and that's                                 important to keep in mind it's important                                 to keep in mind that as a developer so                                 speaking to other developers if you're                                 writing code and you want other people                                 to be able to use your code you need to                                 apply license to it you need to apply a                                 free software license so other people                                 can take your code reuse it rather than                                 being if you don't apply any license                                 they can't use your code at all legally                                 and people often when they hear this say                                 well you know what I just want everyone                                 to have it I just want to give it away I                                 want to be for the public I don't you                                 know I don't want to think about                                 licensing unfortunately in the legal                                 framework we live within that doesn't                                 work there's no effective way for you as                                 an individual to dedicate a particular                                 piece of code to the public domain to                                 really give it away it's pretty hard you                                 have to probably have a lawyer help you                                 with that so instead it's much much                                 easier and really the same thing in                                 terms of the end effect if you apply a                                 very liberal license to that code a                                 liberal open source of free software                                 license to that code that lets anyone                                 who wants to has a license to take the                                 code use it change it and give it to                                 other people that's what you want right                                 so just again if you're writing code                                 make sure that you always include some                                 kind of Licensing statement with it so                                 that people know what terms they can use                                 the code under and I'll talk intermitted                                 about what some of those                                 options are but so we have copyright as                                 the basis of all licenses and one of the                                 things that term the sallman came up                                 with is sort of the basis of the                                 ghannouj eneral public license is a term                                 called copyleft and this is where he had                                 the insight that he could use the rights                                 of the copyright system and instead of                                 enforcing restrictions on of the people                                 he could use copyright to enforce                                 freedoms he uses caught the good new                                 general public license is written so                                 that enforces sharing you don't have any                                 choice you're only the only way you're                                 allowed to use the software under the                                 license from the copyright holder is if                                 you also share it with if you share it                                 then you're giving the person you share                                 it with the same freedoms when sometimes                                 refers to it as a clever hack of the                                 legal system that actually works pretty                                 well are pretty darn well right so this                                 I mean in there have been court cases                                 testing the terms of the general public                                 license and not extensively but in                                 general it is held up that this system                                 of enforcing chairing does work and the                                 cases where it's been challenged of                                 things where people for example have                                 used linux as a basis of like a set-top                                 box right and if they forgot to give                                 everyone the source code or didn't know                                 they needed to or decided not to and                                 they were taken to court and they had to                                 go ahead and give everyone the source                                 code that ran on their set-top box which                                 was based on linux so if you're a                                 developer or a business owner or someone                                 who's out looking at different software                                 projects not just grupal you will                                 typically run into a bunch of different                                 licenses and really the three that i                                 want to talk about in the most common                                 both that you'll encounter and that you                                 might want to apply to your own code the                                 first is the good news eneral public                                 license represented by the guinea of                                 course the sometimes called the bsd                                 license more properly the modified bsd                                 license is a very simple license this is                                 used for for example the openbsd or                                 freebsd operating systems so that's                                 their little mascot there the devil                                 the FreeBSD mascot technically it's a                                 demon as in a background process on a                                 computer again open source people have                                 very bad sense of humor right and the                                 third is the feather which is the symbol                                 of the Apache foundation apache software                                 foundation so apache software foundation                                 has a license but they apply to all                                 their code so for obviously you guys                                 know the apache web server so the code                                 for the apache web server is licensed                                 under the apache software foundation                                 license actually version                                              three of these licenses are basically                                 free software licenses they give you the                                 rights to modify the code and                                 redistribute it but they're not only the                                 general public license the good new one                                 is the only one of these three that's                                 copy left so that's the only one that                                 says if if you receive the source code                                 you must give everyone else the source                                 code when you distribute the software if                                 you want something that's very close to                                 public domain you can use the modified                                 BSD or something like that and that's a                                 such a simple license Pacey just says                                 more or less do what you want with this                                 and there's no warranty don't sue me                                 that's basically what the BSD license                                 says if you're interested in finding out                                 more about the philosophy as Larry said                                 yeah they're sort of a philosophy of                                 free software in addition to the                                 practical implications I have a link                                 here so you can actually download an                                 entire book by richard stallman and if                                 you're interested in the sort of the                                 philosophical underpinnings or how this                                 movement developed but i'd recommend it                                 is really kind of fun reading just to                                 see the thinking process that led to                                 this general public license which is now                                 really an important part of our lives                                 given that its license for Linux license                                 for Drupal license for a lot of the                                 software that we use so again because                                 it's the only copy left license I would                                 argue that GPL is the only license it                                 really preserves your freedom and the                                 good news is that Drupal itself uses the                                 canoe general public license if you look                                 at the FAQ that Larry wrote with input                                 from legal minds                                 you'll see that we say that you can use                                 Drupal under version                                                version of this general public license                                 and that's actually has important                                 implications I don't want to go into                                 them here we can talk about them in the                                 Q&A if people have questions but                                 remember so the GPL is a share alike                                 license and one of the implications that                                 is if you write a module or a theme the                                 legal framework says that modular theme                                 really depends on the Drupal core it's                                 it's derived from the Drupal core right                                 you're if you wrote a module on its own                                 it doesn't do anything if you were at a                                 theme on its own it doesn't do anything                                 therefore it really has to integrate has                                 to be derived from a particular version                                 of Drupal core and therefore that code                                 is covered by the same license as Drupal                                 core which is the gnu general public                                 license um so you don't if you write                                 Drupal code if you write a modular theme                                 you don't have any choice this is                                 important to be aware of you have to                                 distribute have to license that code                                 under the GPL now that might scare                                 people you're thinking wait I'm you know                                 I'm writing this software for my site                                 and I don't want to share it well that's                                 okay the GPL only says if you share it                                 these are the terms there is no                                 requirement that you share your code                                 whatsoever you can keep you know you can                                 go off and you can write as many Drupal                                 modules as you want use them to run any                                 number of websites and you don't have to                                 share the code with anyone so you can                                 keep your website code private that's                                 well within that's within your rights at                                 aqua we certainly have projects where                                 you know we have a few modules custom                                 special modules we're not distributing                                 those those are just you know for our                                 orange internal use and everything else                                 goes to the community and in fact you                                 have the more we share and Larry will                                 talk about this later the more you the                                 more we share though the more we benefit                                 from the system where everyone else can                                 see the code everyone can help us fix                                 the problems with it so really while you                                 can keep code private you should think                                 about really it's to your benefit to                                 share as much as you possibly can                                 one important point on sharing their                                 with PHP code or JavaScript the source                                 form and the usable form are the same                                 thing but if you're doing something in c                                 or java or flash then there's a separate                                 compiled version and a source version                                 what the GPL says is if you distribute                                 the compiled version to someone they                                 have a right to the source version as                                 well so and you have to tell them that                                 they have ax they have a right to that                                 they have access to the source version                                 of the code doesn't matter in the case                                 of PHP code because it's the same thing                                 but if you work in other languages as                                 well that's an important thing to keep                                 in mind that if you distribute the                                 compiled version you have distributed                                 source version as well so one of the                                 reason that you I want to do right                                 you're not distributing the software so                                 there is a version of the GPL called the                                 affair o general public license and this                                 is the license actually used by MongoDB                                 vice yeah and by City CRM and some other                                 projects and that has a clause that says                                 if you put it a like on a public site if                                 it's accessible then you have to share                                 the code right so that's that kind of                                 closes what we call the web service                                 loophole so the GPL even in version                                   decided to maintain this web service                                 loophole that you can run a public                                 service with the coding you're not to                                 give people the the software right yeah                                 but just because you have some custom                                 module erode for a client site or for                                 your site the fact that someone visits                                 your website does not count as them be                                 getting having Co distributed to them                                 they're just visiting your service                                 so you know what in addition to you                                 wanting you to know about how Drupal is                                 licensed this is sort of a philosophical                                 thing as later said it's almost a moral                                 question that you to be a good community                                 to be a healthy community where we help                                 each other we need to support sort of                                 these values of freedom of sharing and                                 part of that is that we need people to                                 be aware of actually what the GPL is and                                 what those values are and how it works                                 and again you know just to sort of                                 reemphasize the GPL even though it's a                                 free software license is actually                                 somewhat restrictive and it's more it's                                 more restrictive than the bsd license                                 more restrictive than the apache license                                 in the sense that you are required to                                 share alike you're not allowed to                                 distribute the binary form without the                                 source form so it's really freedom for                                 the users not so much for the developers                                 but for Drupal we're all both right                                 there's none of us that is a Drupal user                                 and our duple developer not also a                                 Drupal user you're always some                                 combination of both so for us yeah this                                 is the sort of the basis of our whole                                 community is our ability to share all                                 this code so freely another sort of side                                 note that I don't want to go into a lot                                 of detail is that you should be aware in                                 in the broader field of software there's                                 a lot of sort of noise and concern and                                 lawsuits regarding software patents                                 software patents can be a problem for                                 you whether or not use free software                                 whether use so basically anyone involved                                 in developing a software product could                                 be at risk of being sued for violating a                                 software patent but using free software                                 doesn't make that more likely and in                                 fact the version                                                      apache software foundation license                                 version to have some clauses in them to                                 try to penalize anyone who sues someone                                 building on open-source software so we                                 can talk about that a little more later                                 or you can research it                                 it's probably for most rupal people                                 thought that important to clarify it                                 penalizes people who make patent                                 lawsuits against someone using free                                 software if they're also using that code                                 it doesn't penalize someone just using                                 free software right sorry yes I'm                                 kidding him it attempts to penalize the                                 person initiating a patent lawsuit again                                 tested in practice but it's just worth                                 being aware of and there are other                                 challenges to freedom the sort of free                                 software freedom aside from software                                 patents one of the sort of interesting                                 ones both from a sort of philosophical                                 and technical standpoint is the tivo do                                 people know about tivo ization as a term                                 so this was coined by Stallman and he                                 was very upset about this so what Tebow                                 did and still does as far as I know is                                 that they use Linux as the basis of the                                 tivo so they're distributing Linux and                                 they distribute the source code of Linux                                 with it because they must but they also                                 have a chip in the tivo and the chip                                 checks signatures digital signatures                                 basically hashes of all the software in                                 the linux distribution and if those                                 don't match the thing that tivo thinks                                 it should match it won't boot so you                                 have the source code you can modify the                                 source code you can recompile it we                                 can't actually run your modified version                                 on the hardware because it has the chip                                 that prevents you from running a                                 modified version so this upset Richard                                 Stallman very very much and he coined                                 the term tea Bowl ization um though he                                 admitted that this was not violating the                                 terms of the GPL it's you know kind of                                 in a practical term taking away your                                 freedom but you know in terms of the                                 license he'd written it was ok so in                                 version                                                      specifically prohibited yeah so he fixed                                 the bug the the practical effect of this                                 has been very low though because very                                 few projects have switched to GPL                                 version                                                                 version                                                                 new software still the GP                                 too so well you know Solomon did fix the                                 ball gets this this practice of tavola                                 zation is still you know something you                                 should be aware of it you can actually                                 think of cases where this is useful so                                 if imagine this was not a tivo for TV                                 but imagine this is a voting machine                                 running software right and we don't want                                 the voting machine to run modified                                 software so the GPL                                                     a funny exclusion for this that it's                                 okay it's still okay to do this if its                                 commercial hardware and not sold to                                 private citizens basically so that it                                 for exactly the case where you know                                 you're running a voting machine you're                                 running an air traffic control system                                 something where it's really important                                 that that's the right code and it's like                                 a commercial thing but again you know so                                 be aware that there are there are ways                                 you have the GPL is not sort of                                 bulletproof in in every legal sense in                                 terms of your freedoms but is really the                                 best tool that we have out there and to                                 sort of show you the flip side so if we                                 think about those other licenses I                                 mentioned the modified BSD in the apache                                 license those aren't reciprocal licenses                                 so they don't enforce this share alike                                 principle on you our on people who have                                 uses software and I've experienced this                                 myself so I have contributed a little                                 bit to a open source software project is                                 licensed under the apache software                                 foundation license and you know those                                 weren't big improvements but you know                                 okay i'm happy to be a contributor to                                 another project and then i found it okay                                 you know commercial company took a                                 version of this software it's a java                                 project as many the apache projects are                                 and they come you know have a compiled                                 version where they made some other                                 enhancements that looked really                                 interesting they're like wow I'm like                                 this is a great feature I want to know                                 how it works but I can't because it's                                 under the apache software foundation                                 license they have no requirement to                                 distribute the source code so i can get                                 the software in the compiled form I                                 could you know run it under a trial                                 license or I could pay for a commercial                                 license but there's no way for me to get                                 the source code and see how that feature                                 actually works                                 or use it for myself even though I'm one                                 of the contributors to the software that                                 they're selling right so that was very                                 frustrating for me and again I think as                                 a developer you know think about where                                 you want to invest your time with Drupal                                 this is never going to happen to you as                                 I said it a little bit because it's PHP                                 it's hard to make a closed version of                                 PHP but it's possible there are there                                 are software that will make you know                                 obscured or compiled versions PHP where                                 you can't actually see the source that's                                 not something anyone could ever do with                                 Drupal and just a side note again though                                 on on business friendly as Larry said                                 the open source movement is sort of a                                 reaction to two business community not                                 understanding the implication of the                                 word free in free software so this sort                                 of ability to close source the product                                 to sell it even though it has you know                                 community contributors to it is in many                                 circles considered an advantage so the                                 apache software foundation that says                                 that this is why their license actually                                 better than the GPL because people can                                 do this they can make money off it by                                 selling you a proprietary version and                                 that encourages them to contribute to                                 the open source one I don't really agree                                 with that point of view but you know                                 it's worth being aware of that argument                                 and why you know that's that's sort of a                                 again attention you might say between                                 people who advocate free software versus                                 people who advocate open source software                                 another point you know that's important                                 for both contractors developers business                                 own just think about is when you have                                 some code written that you write or you                                 have written on your behalf who owns the                                 copyright that's a really important                                 question because if you remember at the                                 beginning I said licensing drives from                                 the copyright so if you don't you have                                 to know who owns the copyright in order                                 to know who can license the software and                                 who really has the right to distribute                                 the software so if we're in the US the                                 law is pretty clear that if you pay                                 someone to write something for you a                                 novel or a piece of software the person                                 who paid                                 owns the copyright in the EU I'm not as                                 clear on the situation I think in some                                 cases you may actually retain the                                 copyright even though someone else paid                                 you to write the work so I would if                                 you're in the you may know the answer                                 this question already if you're not sure                                 I would you should investigate it if                                 you're working though as a full-time                                 employee the copyright almost always                                 belongs to the company you work for so                                 the code that I write the code that                                 Larry rights potentially you know                                 belongs to our employers and this is in                                 terms of your Drupal contribution                                 something to think about because it's                                 not your willingness to contribute back                                 to the community that matters it's you                                 may also have to convince your boss your                                 CEO someone that it's to the advantage                                 of you it's the advantage the company                                 its advantage the community for the                                 company to contribute this code that's                                 under their copyright you know and once                                 they contribute it once they distribute                                 it's automatically into the GPL but they                                 have the choice as I said before they                                 could keep that soft that code in house                                 there's no requirement that they send it                                 out and you as an employee don't                                 necessarily have the right to share it                                 because you don't own the copyright                                 another thing to keep in mind there at                                 some companies I think this is more                                 common in the u.s. than in Europe code                                 that you write on your own time may or                                 may not be owned by your employer                                 depending on your employment contract                                 check it I I would personally recommend                                 not signing a contract that gives your                                 employer ownership of cody rights on                                 your own time but some employment                                 contracts do say that so be aware of                                 that and look into that not really                                 copyright questions more of a contract                                 law question but something to bear in                                 mind so another thing to think about you                                 know again as a developer as a                                 contractor as a business owner is                                 questions about you know when you do a                                 project who ends up owning the copyright                                 what is the license how is the code                                 going to be distributed or not                                 distributed at the end of that project                                 so in particular you should think about                                 when you're signing contracts                                 does that contract specify who ends the                                 copyright so what I mentioned before is                                 that you the general overriding law you                                 know in the es and you may be different                                 but you can really write a contract that                                 specifies those terms and that contract                                 then overrides whatever the general law                                 is in the absence of the contract so                                 when you sign contract or someone you                                 may want to go ahead and say you know                                 the code i right you know will be you                                 know I will retain the copyright to the                                 code I right for you as part of the                                 project you know now people may push                                 back and not be willing to do that but                                 it's an option and i know some companies                                 like Larry's actually require that other                                 clients they require their clients to                                 give the copyright back to palantir so                                 the palantir can then reuse the code or                                 share it with the community we've had                                 that policy for                                                       owns code that we write for a client and                                 license it to the client the past                                 several years it's been licensed to the                                 client under the GPL some clients have a                                 hard time swallowing this concept once                                 the their legal department doesn't get                                 it but we have been able to convince                                 them that no this is not a threat to you                                 yes it's okay no you can't own the                                 copyright to all of Drupal sorry not                                 everyone's legal department is fully                                 clued in as a developer as a consultant                                 part of your job is to educate your                                 clients on you know why not just Drupal                                 is right for them but the GPL is right                                 for them because that is part and parcel                                 of drew using Drupal so in addition to                                 actual contracts when you're an employee                                 when your contractor depending on who                                 you working with you may also have                                 non-disclosure agreements so you should                                 if you have such an agreement sign you                                 should look at it because that again may                                 end up restricting you from distributing                                 code even though you own the copyright                                 you may have a nondisclosure agreement                                 and you're the person working with say                                 may say no that's actually confidential                                 information and I'm going to sue you if                                 you put it on drupal.org so again you                                 know if you sign those kind of                                 agreements think it you know think a                                 little bit about okay how does this                                 actually affect code i right how does                                 this affect it in my ability to                                 contribute back or release things that                                 aren't really secret                                 it's just you know part of this project                                 that i'm working on a client with                                 another option that i know some shops                                 take i believe for kitchens does is that                                 they don't ask the copyright to the code                                 but they put a term in their contracts                                 requiring the clients to license back                                 the code to them under the under the GPL                                 i mean obviously ass PG PL so the client                                 then ends up with a copyright which                                 maybe makes their legal department feel                                 better but because they have then agreed                                 to license the code back to four                                 kitchens or to you know whoever there                                 the shop is that shop is then free to                                 continue to redistribute that code                                 because it's g pls share alike they have                                 that freedom so that's sort of a                                 workaround if you can't in for you know                                 can't get the copyright assignment if                                 you can ask the code to be license back                                 to you if you effectively have the same                                 end result in terms of your ability to                                 share the code a final thing is as if                                 you're a developer and you're going out                                 and you're looking you know sort of in                                 the broader world you look at github you                                 look at there is you know code sharing                                 sites and you see some code you want to                                 use you need to stop and think of a                                 little bit about what licenses that code                                 being shared under hopefully it has a                                 license statement at all so github                                 doesn't require people put a license                                 statement on the code and you know that                                 means by default you can't actually use                                 the code you can read it but you can't                                 you can't take it and use it for                                 anything if code is licensed under                                 something very liberal like the modified                                 bsd you can combine it freely with GPL                                 code and that's great so if that's sort                                 of why i said the beginning if you want                                 something to be used most widely you                                 want to be essentially free the modified                                 bsd is fine because then someone can                                 then take that and combine it with let's                                 say drupal code and then it will be                                 under the GPL but they've at least you                                 know they haven't been inhibited from                                 reusing it it gives a little more                                 complex with some other licenses like                                 the apache license is compatible with                                 version                                                                so again if you're doing your own                                 projects i would recommend sticking with                                 either GPL or something like the                                 modified bsd that's a very very simple                                 license                                 thank you Peter so you know this is                                 great this is wonderful it's a lot of                                 fun rules and legalisms and contract law                                 and oh boy so what's in it for me what                                 is it that is you know what benefit do                                 you actually get out of doing using free                                 software aside from the only way you're                                 allowed to use Drupal what benefit is                                 there to you to actually participating                                 in a free software project you know what                                 value do you get out of that and the key                                 question here is there are lots of                                 different ways of defining value most                                 people define value in terms of money                                 but that is not the only way to define                                 certifying value advance you can define                                 value in a number of different ways                                 depending on what your goals are in an                                 open source project and free song in the                                 free software world the primary currency                                 is not money but karma and we don't mean                                 karma in the you know hand-wavy                                 spiritual rebirth sense we mean karma in                                 terms of reputation good deeds building                                 you know good good street cred                                 essentially because that's what leads to                                 a kind of come on you know you scratch                                 my back I'll scratch yours type of                                 environment in a good case in point here                                 when I first got involved in Drupal                                   years ago I had a hard time getting                                 Drupal installed and I posted in the                                 forums and you ask a question and some                                 guy answered my question and help me get                                 Drupal installed he didn't have to he                                 didn't get paid for it but five years                                 later six years later we now have a new                                 totally awesome database layer in Drupal                                                                                                         that he now gets the benefit from and he                                 didn't have to spend a dime on it                                 because you know me and a team that i                                 led managed to write that instead                                 another case in point                                 when my company palantir first started                                 getting involved in Drupal we had some                                 trouble you with the views module just                                 picking out how to do things with it                                 everyone knows the views module okay and                                 so I started talkin to Earl miles the                                 maintainer and he spent a fair amount of                                 time walking me through how do you some                                 particularly complex things with views                                 that he had given away for free to us                                 and you know we didn't pay him for that                                 I eventually bought him dinner but he                                 actually didn't make any money off that                                 what he got though was new features                                 added two views that I wrote later on on                                 future projects I did at palantir and                                 then went on and gave several                                 presentations at Drupal cons on using                                 views and pushing those kind of                                 architectural changes so he's getting                                 something back for that time he invested                                 in helping me because then working with                                 the project I'm then helping him the                                 database layer working on views itself                                 and so forth in a collaborative model                                 the best way to get what you want is to                                 give other people what they want this is                                 and any successful business is built on                                 this concept as is any successful open                                 source project because you know this is                                 how you build up this how you                                 demonstrate that you are a good person                                 to work with and that's what you really                                 want now isn't this you know you're                                 still giving away what what you the                                 value you bring to the table your code                                 not true because your code is useless no                                 one hires you for your code they hire                                 you because you're smart at palantir you                                 know our intellectual capital is the                                 experience and expertise and                                 problem-solving we bring to the table                                 not code people don't hire palantir                                 because of the code Eve written the                                 higher palantir because of our brains                                 that we have demonstrated by releasing                                  code and giving it away for free because                                  we've demonstrated our expertise in                                  using Drupal in working with third-party                                  systems and tying goes into Drupal and

    in Drupal and that's what people pay for                                  and that kind of participation                                  demonstrating your expertise is how you

                             power that's the value you get out of                                  participating in open source you know                                  because i've contributed so much to the                                  project I'm now one of the initiative                                  owners for Drupal                                                     enormous influence into the direction of                                  the project because I've been working                                  with it for so long that I've gotten the                                  attention of other developers that's                                  value what you you're building come on                                  is your reputation and reputation in                                  open source is everything reputation is                                  marketing if you want to be you know                                  economic about it reputation allows you                                  to do things like be selective with your                                  clients at palantir you know we have our                                  high enough profile that we can be                                  selective in who we work with you know                                  we can say you know we don't need to                                  take every client that walks through the                                  door we can pick and choose these the                                  clients we find interesting this is the                                  work we want to do these the clients we                                  want to work with that matters that's                                  valuable and that's something you get by                                  building good reputation in the                                  community allows you be selective in                                  your employees it's hard to find good                                  Drupal talent there's a way more demand                                  for Drupal people than there are                                  Google developers but if you have the                                  kind of reputation then you're more                                  likely to be able to attract top talent                                  whether your consultants like palantir                                  whether your services company like aquia                                  whether you are one big site like                                  examiner com or the New York Times both                                  of whom run Drupal having that kind of                                  reputation not just of having a big site                                  but playing nice with the community will                                  attract the kind of people you want to                                  attract I'd lets you know your employees                                  beforehand too because reputation is                                  also your resume at the penalty r I've                                  frequently been in the position of                                  hiring new developers and when we get a                                  resume in for someone I don't look at                                  the actual resume first thing I do is I                                  go to drupal.org and see what they've                                  done what modules are they written can I                                  look at their code and see if it's good                                  code what are they like in the issue                                  queue so they polite are they jerks do                                  they work on the whole bunch of models                                  modules of the state of one a little                                  area what's their expertise in a given                                  area are they helping people out in the                                  forums what are they like an IRC these                                  are the kind of things that you can                                  build by working in an open source                                  project this gets you clients this gets                                  you hired skip it yeah so for time                                  reasons get this this worked out really                                  well for palantir back at rubicon san                                  francisco we hired a whole bunch of new                                  people because we had our pick of really                                  good candidates this is also a business                                  philosophy free software is a business                                  philosophy not just a software                                  philosophy that is based in trust and by                                  trust I mean you know just the basis of                                  how you do business when you're dealing                                  with proprietary software you're dealing                                  with fear you're dealing with the fear                                  that your client is going to go                                  elsewhere you're dealing with the fear                                  that the consultants you're working with                                  is going to stab you in the back you're                                  dealing with the fear that someone else                                  is going to come along and do something                                  better than                                  you can and you won't be able to compete                                  dealing with fear that you're not good                                  enough to compete in the market I was                                  also going to say and private air                                  companies also use fear against open                                  source and particularly even against                                  Drupal and you'll see this in the                                  broader world and should be aware of it                                  that people say well buy our product it                                  is more secure because it's commercial                                  it is more secure it has less bugs it                                  goes faster all I can see your code how                                  do I trust you that it's actually more                                  secure right so you can't see the cut                                  right you don't know you don't know how                                  many bugs that our house here it is but                                  but big software vendors will use this                                  argument and sort of this trust model is                                  your defense against that because free                                  software is at the end of the day based                                  on trust trust that you know your client                                  is not going to go elsewhere because                                  you're good enough trust that your                                  reputation is good enough that we'll get                                  you new clients trust that when you're                                  working with the rest of the community                                  you will get back as much as you put in                                  it's based on trusting in the community                                  review process that's lots of eyes                                  working on code is going to make better                                  code great quote from Chris DiBona from                                  google app drupalcon Boston several                                  years ago popular open source software                                  tends to be secure because insecure open                                  source software becomes unpopular fast                                  it's a good line okay with free software                                  you're trusting in yourself and your                                  clients and in your community and                                  personally I'm more comfortable working                                  in an environment and a culture that is                                  based on trust than fear as opposed to                                  what the business and as a society I                                  think that trust model also helps you                                  make business pitches because you can go                                  to a client and say you can go to anyone                                  else with this project if I'm not good                                  enough yeah that I'm going to satisfy                                  you but you're not locked in by choosing                                  Drupal                                  you have the freedom to choose any you                                  know these hundred consulting firms to                                  finish the project if it doesn't work                                  out between you and me and that that                                  pitch of trust me because you're not                                  locked in I think helps win business if                                  you can use it effectively and that                                  doesn't mean you're that clients are                                  going to wander off on a regular basis                                  it means that they can sleep at night                                  knowing that they're not wholly                                  dependent on this one developer or on                                  this one company and vice versa and that                                  builds a trusting relationship between                                  you and your client or you and your                                  vendor where you're working together                                  rather than one of you having the other                                  by the balls and that's just a better                                  environment to be in side note so I                                  tomorrow afternoon there's a session                                  called having an open relationship with                                  software is that right so with Jacob                                  representing so if he's going to focus                                  even a little bit more on the business                                  aspects of this how how to make money                                  how to run a business in an open source                                  project that's part two so                                  so for the recording that's practical                                  techniques for engaging obviously people                                  watching the cording it's not going to                                  help you much but ever in the room I do                                  encourage you to go to that session so                                  we've got about                                                          so for Drupal                                                           you're right the question is marking                                  code files as what the licensing terms                                  are them I are on them for Drupal what                                  we recommend is don't put that in the                                  code file because when you package it                                  when the system package is a tarball a                                  tar.gz file or a dot zip file it adds a                                  license that txt file that is a copy of                                  GPL version                                                        applies to this module well the                                  copyright statement I mean Drupal core                                  itself has a separate file true saying                                  all this code is copyright I I think                                  that I asked about the license of the                                  copyright on copy okay that's okay the                                  caveat is if you're getting lots of                                  patches from different people then                                  unless you're having them sign some kind                                  of agreement there's lots of people who                                  own copyright there are probably around                                                                                                      various pieces of Drupal core and                                  tracking that you know this function                                  this line and so forth is copyright this                                  person is very impractical in a project                                  like drupal I'd recommends having a                                  major contributors list that is these                                  are people have done large work on the                                  system they may have been maintained us                                  at some point but you don't say these                                  are all the people who will copyright                                  its these are the major contributors all                                  of whom are going to also hold copyright                                  but that's not you're saying it you're                                  not saying it's an exclusive list                                  yeah it might be easier to just have                                  that set one separate file also if you                                  have                                                                   new major contributor you don't just I                                  want to have to have to remember to                                  update every single code file one text                                  file is probably sufficient I mean we                                  really haven't had challenges but it's                                  useful just at least note who the major                                  contributors are now if if it's code                                  that you're not putting on drupal.org                                  and you just you know custom module for                                  your client you've given to your clients                                  I would put a doc block on there saying                                  copyright my company licensed under the                                  GPL is a standard header that the GPL                                  suggest you use so if you're not                                  distributing it on drupal.org I would                                  recommend doing that other questions all                                  the way in the back it                                  not so the question is you know license                                  compatibility you know what does that                                  mean essentially for example the Apache                                  to license I says in essence here's the                                  code do what you want have fun but if                                  you have any patents software patents                                  that apply to this code and you sue                                  someone over those software patents you                                  lose any license to use this code that                                  other people own so like if you if I                                  ahold of software patents and I you know                                  add some code to the Apache web server                                  and that gets distributed and then I go                                  and Sue Sony who is using apache over                                  that software patent then I lose the                                  right to use apache at all from the                                  various other people who have written                                  code for the Apache server that's kind                                  of their mutual the mutual assured                                  destruction kind of approach to software                                  patents that that's incompatible with                                  GPL version                                                      additional requirement and part of the                                  GPL is you may not add additional                                  requirements and restrictions to the                                  code it's you must share alike and you                                  cannot add any new restrictions like you                                  know you can't say you can't use this                                  for government or you can't use this for                                  some political party or whatever that's                                  an extra restriction GPL version                                        essentially the same patent defense                                  clause in it so you're not adding a new                                  restriction by mixing apache                                             code so that's okay so that's what we                                  mean by compatible it mostly applies to                                  the GPL family of licenses because of                                  the you cannot add any restrictions                                  clause so that's that answer your                                  question and if yeah if you go to the                                  the GPL site they actually have a long                                  list I mean there's many many licenses                                  you can go to open source or you can go                                  to the the GPL site and they list you                                  know there's                                                            you know there's really you know don't                                  pick a random license pick one of these                                  like basically three licenses I picked                                  up here because it really well                                  understood how they work and                                  they interact with each other but if you                                  find some project licensed under                                  something you can go there especially                                  the GPL side and I'll tell you yes you                                  can combine this with the GPL because it                                  doesn't have any other restrictions or                                  no it has some strange clause the                                  important thing to note is that it's                                  always okay for you to use both of those                                  together the restriction on combining is                                  basically distributing to other people a                                  combined software that uses both of that                                  and giving the code to your client at                                  the end of a project may or may not                                  count as distributing depending on your                                  contract so it's generally best to only                                  mix things that would be legal for you                                  to distribute if you're going to yeah                                  questions why is Drupal GPL to and not                                  three when Drupal is started there was                                  no GPL                                                                  just said GPL and didn't really consider                                  the version since then we have clarified                                  that Drupal is GPL                                                     GPL                                                                     the discussion of whether or not Drupal                                  should move to GPL                                                       like to do so at some point not                                  necessarily right now but I would like                                  to do so at some point but that you know                                  there are people who would say the                                  opposite because of things like the the                                  patent protection clause there are some                                  companies that don't want to deal with                                  GPL                                                                     that that conversation just hasn't                                  happened my own personal feeling is if                                  they're going to get scared off by that                                  then I don't want them but I freely                                  understand that I'm not necessarily the                                  only opinion there can you can release a                                  drupal module under GPL                                                   upload it to drupal org unless it is GPL                                  too and later right now you cannot put                                  anything on drupal.org software-wise                                  unless it is GPL too and later the same                                  license as Drupal core were we to switch                                  to GPL                                                                  blanket statements across everything and                                  so all contribute all just as they come                                  off drupal.org would go up to GPL three                                  at the same time but again there's no                                  immediate plans to do so                                  good customer here                                  so the point is that the new project may                                  actually have a working Colonel now yeah                                  i heard debian was talking about doing                                  the herd bastes first at some point I                                  never actually saw it in the wild                                  they're saying into                                                      may or may not have a working new heard                                  Colonel at some points in the near                                  future you heard it here first other                                  questions I think we've time for one                                  maybe two more work one more minute yeah
