Some of the earliest and most complex deployments of Drupal Commerce have been developed in Europe, including Eurocentres for global language course sales, SubHub for subscription management, and traditional physical product sales at augustes.com. These sites' developers have worked their way through the dark corners of the Commerce APIs and really blazed a trail through Drupal 7 site development in general, contributing patches and knowledge upstream to the project and community.

Join us for a panel discussion moderated by Ryan Szrama that explores the experience of these developers and Commerce Guys' own integration team to find out what it's like to develop with Drupal Commerce in preparation for your next big project. Questions will focus on building sites with complex requirements, integrating with third party services, and using Drupal Commerce in Europe.

Along the way, you can expect topical introductions to specific features of the core and contributed Drupal Commerce modules, such as:

Understanding and interacting with the pricing system
Using the core tax system to properly display and collect VAT
Collecting shipping charges during checkout
Best practices for payment gateway integration and recurring payments
Creating customized Add to Cart and Checkout forms
Working with custom line item types
These topics have been chosen based on real world projects delivered by Commerce Guys and the companies represented by developers on the panel. Introductions and questions will be scripted, but the discussion will be free flowing with opportunities for attendees to ask follow-up questions.

Intended audience
Developers who need to know how to plan and deploy Drupal Commerce sites that integrate with a variety of e-commerce web services and / or require custom solutions based on the core Commerce components and systems.

Questions answered by this session
How does the core product pricing system work?

How can I customize the buying experience for non-physical product sales?

How should I best integrate with the payment and line item systems?

What should I keep in mind when quoting complex Drupal Commerce projects?

Where can I go for development support and how can I give back?

sites building                                some of the essential contributed                                modules that we've needed to flesh out                                what Drupal commerce can do and also                                there's been really good contributors                                back to the project in terms of bug                                review

software and i'm really                                impressed with people like Peter who                                start working on Drupal on the most                                complex site that I've seen as their                                first introduction with drupal commerce                                still in alpha and Drupal                                              and I mean like he's an early adopter                                par excellence so so I'm really                                impressed with these guys and I and I                                hope that what they have to show you                                about what they've been working on will                                give you some idea of what you can do                                when you develop sites with Drupal                                commerce and we will be looking at                                mostly screenshots of things that                                they've actually built with them                                discussing the implementation I'm not                                actually going to pull up any code                                because I don't think you'll be able to                                read it anyways but if you want to top                                coat afterwards feel free to find any of                                us we've all got our hands there                                me but we'll just dive in with the                                presentation here so one thing that I                                like to do whenever I give a drupal                                commerce presentation is sort of sort of                                frame the discussion so you understand                                where we've come from and where we think                                we're going with Drupal commerce so                                obviously i started my dribble                                development with do Burkhardt and                                whenever we started to have working on                                ubercart we had a very application                                mindset thinking what should over cart                                be able to do and that's whose Drupal                                eyes just sort of the base this provides                                the CMS functionality ubercart is the                                e-commerce application it needs a                                feature list and so we would just work                                toward those features and what we                                eventually did is we worked ourselves                                into a hole because some features never                                worked together such as v                                              I think he still couldn't you know get                                your taxes right around that                                multi-currency never really worked great                                at a core a core level and and then just                                you know if we didn't have features                                there the question in the issue wasn't                                you know how can I build this using all                                these other contributed modules from                                Drupal but why does an uber cart do this                                and so we're really trying to deflect a                                lot of those questions now by focusing                                more on being an e-commerce framework                                and so we I guess it would be fair to                                say we are a little bit more than just a                                framework if you don't be a framework                                purist but we have this framework                                mentality where the core of Drupal                                commerce is just the core systems and                                components you need to do ecommerce on                                top of Drupal and so and what I guess                                what that looks like is we have in a few                                core entities and fields that I'll                                introduce in a minute things like a                                shopping cart in a checkout form but but                                we aren't hard coding business rules we                                 aren't hard coding any sort of business                                 logic into the modules themselves                                 instead we're depending on other modules                                 like views and rules and entity to                                 provide a lot of this configurable                                 ecommerce functionality on the backend                                 so so with that with uber card and with                                 Magento and os commerce and a lot of                                 other e-commerce applications the                                 question you might come to it with this                                 what can I do with this with Drupal                                 commerce the question we want you to                                 have when you come to it is what can I                                 build with it and if you need a good                                 starting point there are distributions                                 in other ways that like led commerce                                 kickstart that will help you start doing                                 something quick but still the big                                 question is                                 what can i what can I build with it and                                 i think that the testimony of these guys                                 will be that they've been able to build                                 some quite diverse stuff all using the                                 same core project now without having to                                 do any hacking of core i hope and with                                 you know contributing a lot of patches                                 helps you not have to hack cool right so                                 you know moving on we have also this                                 slide that we've used since Chicago to                                 sort of explain what I feel is the                                 drupal commerce ecosystem or platform                                 and we're starting of course with with                                 drupal and drupal commerce is the                                 foundation of everything and now we                                 actually did just get the drupal                                 commerce                                                                so it was really exciting yeah we                                 actually we actually wore out one of our                                 developers he just had to go home boy                                 yawns no longer with us when I was it                                 was a bit of a marathon just to make                                 sure we had all of our tests are passing                                 there's no critical issues it really it                                 is production ready we're using it in                                 production sites these guys all have                                 production sites and we're really                                 confident in the strength of our                                 foundation so I really think the solid                                 tag on the side is is really fitting but                                 it is it doesn't do everything it's not                                 a robust ecommerce application at its                                 core so for the application type                                 features we're depending on what we call                                 essential contributed modules and so                                 there are things those are things like                                 Jacobs shipping module if you want to do                                 a calculated shipping or flat rate                                 shipping that's not essential to what                                 e-commerce is the business of you know                                 finding out what somebody wants to                                 purchase and taking their money it is                                 pretty essential for a lot of people                                 doing e-commerce so this is this is an                                 essential contributed module for us it's                                 one that even though it's not part of                                 core will be maintaining I'll be helping                                 maintain right along with the core                                 modules and that's actually been my                                 focus for the last week before the con                                 is shipping and other payment modules                                 like PayPal and cybersource and                                 authorize and I guess these guys have a                                 host of other payment modules they'll                                 talk about in a few minutes but then on                                 top of these essential contributor                                 modules we still know that that's not                                 going to be usable for most people like                                 a casual store administrator a newcomer                                 to e-commerce because you still have to                                 know how to install a drupal module how                                 to configure a view how to build a rule                                 and                                 you know almost a programming language                                 in itself so what we're going to do is                                 target pre-configured features and use                                 case specific distributions of Drupal                                 these are things like the commerce                                 kickstart which takes the core Drupal                                 Commerce modules and packages them up                                 into a store out of the box it's it's a                                 very minimal store right now but we have                                 the ability for it to create example                                 content and guidelines perhaps for you                                 to know how to use the Commerce modules                                 and how to how to start building a store                                 successfully and then the last piece of                                 the ecosystem of course is that even                                 that won't be enough for everybody so we                                 still need accessible experts and                                 integrators whether it's commerce guys                                 one of our partner is one of these guys                                 on stage or one of the many developers                                 that have been contributing in the queue                                 and then you know of course whenever we                                 talk about accessible experts and                                 integrators and support for e-commerce                                 we also are happy to announce that this                                 con that commerce guys will be                                 partnering with aqua to actually have                                 service level agreement type support for                                 ecommerce sites on Drupal that's really                                 exciting for us because it it really                                 brings a measure of viability in a sense                                 to Drupal as an e-commerce platform for                                 large-scale corporations to know that                                 they can actually have dependable                                 predictable support of the software so                                 what we're going to talk about in the                                 next questions and things that I present                                 to our panel are how do these guys make                                 use of our core entities and fields                                 which are things like a product entity                                 line items which go on orders customer                                 profiles which capture billing and                                 shipping information and payment                                 transactions which of course capture                                 every attempted transaction in the                                 result from the Gateway so we'll be                                 discussing these I'm going to slide                                 really quickly through these slides                                 they'll be online with more description                                 if you want to read through them later                                 we'll go through these core entities and                                 fields and we'll also talk about our                                 core commerce systems one of the primary                                 ones of which is the product pricing                                 system which I'll introduce in detail in                                 about                                                                 product pricing system for all of our                                 dynamic pricing and taxes and discounts                                 and fees and currency conversion and                                 everything else all working through the                                 rules module we have our shopping cart                                 which all works through the views module                                 and we have a checkout system that has                                 the drag and drop form builder multi                                 page single page you name                                 it and then of course we have a payment                                 system that everybody's going to have to                                 deal with one way or another so having                                 introduced Drupal commerce and the core                                 entities and fields and core systems I                                 want to start asking our panel some                                 interesting questions so the first one                                 is how can you customize the buying                                 experience with Drupal commerce and you                                 know are you locked into one paradigm do                                 you even need a shopping cart if you've                                 used uber cart you familiar with the the                                 the cart module containing all of the                                 checkout codes there is no separation                                 between a cart and checkout so what I'd                                 like these guys to do is to show us you                                 know how exactly they've been able to                                 customize the buying experience and in                                 some cases get rid of the shopping cart                                 and checkout all together and still use                                 commerce as the base for their                                 e-commerce system so first I want to                                 pitch this to rich you know how have you                                 guys that I cost customized the buying                                 experience for your clients okay yeah                                 thanks Ryan so what we've got actually                                 to show you first it's really really                                 simple example and this particular site                                 we were building didn't need quantities                                 because they were selling unique                                 products and and really one thing might                                 Ryan mention there which is just so                                 critical and really really really                                 powerful is that the cart and the cart                                 block are now powered by views so in                                 this particular example here we were                                 able to just redefine the view so that                                 we took the quantity column away and                                 again very very simple example but the                                 fact is now in uber car we would have                                 had to go into the theme layer would had                                 to have a messing around with the car                                 forward as all sorts of things but now                                 because it's all views it's very very                                 simple and you can just change that                                 exactly as you want and it's the same                                 with them with the can't block as well                                 yeah it's really exciting actually we                                 got the views form functionality is now                                 a part of use                                                          actually build you know drag and drop                                 form not just with commerce but I assume                                 that other modules are going to start                                 using it too but I don't know of any yet                                 so we're the first ones to find the bugs                                 and then I guess we also have Peter if                                 you want to talk about euro centers and                                 I just tell me when to flip your slides                                 and yeah euro census is a very special                                 case where we                                 cell language curses in foreign                                 countries so you can't buy several                                 curses at the time and that's why we                                 totally bypass the card as you know it                                 and we changed it to a some kind of a                                 product configuration this means this                                 one is customized this whole part shows                                 all the options a language course can                                 have and if you switch it actually what                                 you see here in this corner is the                                 correct view so and with some Ajax magic                                 you can have it like changing something                                 in the page in the configuration and you                                 see immediately the change of the price                                 and and fees and all that stuff so no                                 card icon and another idea behind that                                 is the user experience and the                                 conversion rate you don't allow the                                 customer to escape so you have you have                                 this one way now well if you found a                                 cool school now decide what you really                                 want and then let's go travelling and                                 learn foreign languages and do they even                                 do check out on here or is it just like                                 booking and pay offline right now they                                 have a checkout flow with an overview                                 but no payment at the moment because our                                 customer takes really care of every                                 detail of the travel and and gets in                                 touch with them and provides more                                 information and yeah some kind of                                 offline upselling okay great thanks                                 Peter and then Jamie with sub hub if                                 you're going to talk about your your                                 custom buying experience and what you've                                 done to make it work there we go so our                                 core offering is basically a                                 subscription model where users are                                 signing up for our client sites and                                 buying effectively a role                                 so this here is we invented a new                                 product type called a subscription and                                 this here is just a view displaying the                                 what it would be more rolls but there's                                 anyone and it's really because I uses a                                 quite low level that they want a very                                 simple experience so it's literally you                                 click the button go to your checkout                                 page and it all happens on there you                                 can't actually see the submit button                                 underneath but it would be there if I                                 had a bigger screen to capture this is a                                 custom check out for more using the cord                                 check out this is actually completely                                 custom it bypasses the core show how                                 completely so we've built the form that                                 utilizes the entity's awesome off of the                                 product when you hit submit an ajax                                 magic happens so it goes back generates                                 the order and adds the line items to it                                 and then redirects to paypal and when I                                 hell happened                                 also happens do you have to be a magic                                 user to start using Drupal commerce yeah                                 yeah you guys have a time Ajax magic and                                 stuff but hey the berry danger is not so                                 high but if you want to learn magic I                                 mean we can teach well marketing bus                                 word marketing buzz word okay okay cool                                 and so yeah so these guys I guess so we                                 started with rich is saying that you can                                 use views in the UI even to sort of                                 affect the buying experience in the cart                                 block and cart form level and then we                                 have petered bypassing the ID card form                                 entirely Jamie's now bypassing check out                                 and doing his own thing and then lastly                                 I think Jacob you had one where you guys                                 just you don't you don't even use card                                 or check out right that's right okay I                                 think this is a good example of how you                                 know Google commerce can be used as a                                 framework and you don't you're not                                 locked into do it in a certain way like                                 you are uber car and now this page is                                 what you get to on the side roommate                                 it's a printing company and it doesn't                                 actually use products use web form                                 instead and the problem is that we faced                                 is that they they have a very complex                                 price calculation so if you order like                                 ten magazines it's one price so when you                                 make scenes is different prize so                                 instead of make like millions of                                 permutations of products we make a web                                 form where you can fill in different                                 stuff as you would with a product and                                 when you click order you get this page                                 and you can see on the top left it is                                 the details from that web form with                                 a basically product info and on the                                 right hand side you have the customer                                 details in order to use this stuff they                                 need to be what we call a pro customer                                 so they they are known by the company                                 and they have an agreement so they have                                 they there already have a custom                                 customer profile so we pulled it in                                 using the customer profile entity and                                 there is different fields for for the                                 order you can give it an title so you                                 can search on it and manage your own                                 orders and at the bottom we have a file                                 widget where you can upload multiple                                 files typically you want to to have a                                 printing files saying if you print a                                 magazines you have a cover you have all                                 the pages and basically what went for is                                 is have a single page where you can do                                 all that stuff and at the bottom you                                 just click Submit and behind the scenes                                 we managed to create a web form                                 submission we link that through the line                                 item we add the price from the                                 calculation where the images or the                                 printing files and where the order info                                 at the order and all of that we link                                 together as a single order and we send                                 them off to to a completion page and                                 because of the comment system they can                                 use they can see their orders and the                                 the people at the printing company they                                 can use the backend of commerce to see                                 all the orders that's made and they are                                 notified by email and and they have                                 different customers there have a system                                 to call project managers so they manage                                 different companies and so they handle                                 maybe the needs you two to talk about                                 when the printing can be done they need                                 to push it ahead and stuff like that so                                 they can still see all the the orders                                 coming through on the front and as well                                 the customers can go and view their                                 order history and everything exactly and                                 that's still core functionality or did                                 you customize yes that's basically                                 commas call you know we customize the                                 some of the functionality on on the user                                 page where you can see you the orders so                                 we added some search functionality and                                 we added some some advanced views                                 integrations so different users that are                                 part of the same company can can see all                                 the orders that screen weight and crew                                 so and in the back end actually just                                 come as more or less out of the box cool                                 yeah so what we're trying to sort of                                 give a big picture here of is that you                                 know you can do anything you can                                 customize this tailor make it to a                                 particular business need whether it's no                                 card no check out orders into it on the                                 back and you can use it as an invoicing                                 system where you create an order and                                 then just send a customer at checkout                                 URL you don't have to have the carton                                 lounge well you don't have to have the                                 checkout module but but I should say                                 that you know what's what's what's the                                 double negative here non-developers can                                 still use this so you don't have to be                                 like in advance you know core patch                                 contributor to be able to build a store                                 and maybe we should have started with                                 just like a generic example here's the                                 experience out of the box because we                                 still are providing you know the card                                 experience the checkout experience and                                 then rules that execute on checkout                                 completion to create user accounts and                                 email notifications update order                                 statuses and all the light we just                                 didn't demonstrate that we sort of went                                 straight for the hey we can customize it                                 but you know                                 I think developers synagogue Torah I can                                 just rewrite anything I want tune that                                 may be intimidating for some of you but                                 we are still very much concerned with                                 the out-of-the-box experience and we've                                 had Boyan summer has been a really                                 integral part of the team he's on the                                 usability team for Drupal                                            really been making sure that what we're                                 doing conforms to best practices and and                                 that is good for four core and for                                 e-commerce conversion some that's that's                                 the gist of the first question I suppose                                 how can we customize the the buying                                 experience and if you have any further                                 questions maybe hold on determine you                                 can refer back to something that                                 somebody said and we'll have time for                                 Q&A at the end but I want to move on to                                 one of the what I think is that the                                 pinnacle achievements I guess of Drupal                                 commerce in its core product pricing                                 system I introduced this just a little                                 bit ago is that the main thing through                                 which every product price is calculated                                 and what happens is whenever you want to                                 see a product on a page but I want to go                                 to this t-shirts product page or                                 something it's going to have a price                                 there but the way we arrive at that                                 price is we package it up into a line                                 item as though it was in my shopping                                 cart right now we send it through rules                                 and then all the different rules that                                 are attached to this event called                                 calculate the sell price of a product                                 they can alter the unit price of this                                 line item so they can say at attacks                                 subtract this discount convert to this                                 currency based on where the users                                 shopping from and all of these changes                                 are going to be stored inside this price                                 data array so we actually have like a                                 change log of what's happened to every                                 price on the page and so that whichever                                 rules got executed whether it was you                                 know the that well you can't really read                                 those can you you know whether it was                                 taxes whether it was discount so you can                                 actually come back and see this trail of                                 how did I arrived at this price which                                 lets you do some fun things like I think                                 I won't steal with just under but that's                                 to do some fun things with that data on                                 the product page itself and then also                                 these prices at the unit price level                                 will then make their way over to the                                 total of line item down to the order                                 total and display to you on the checkout                                 pages and cart pages sort of a breakdown                                 of how much so this is the base price of                                 the product how much of this was you                                 know your v                                                              membership or bulk reseller discount                                 and then your grand order total and it's                                 very flexible in terms of display you                                 can have I guess price components or                                 things that get altered onto the price                                 that don't display up front and only                                 appear at the end such as us type sales                                 tax and maybe sales tax in other                                 countries where you calculate it up                                 front but you don't display it until you                                 actually display the order total but you                                 can also do your v                                                     through a pricing rule or on the product                                 edit page entering your prices including                                 a particular v                                                       flexible in terms of how when where you                                 actually alter the price and what you do                                 with the data after the fact and so I                                 guess what I'd like to do is maybe just                                 start with euro centers Peter and I just                                 just explain us how you've used the                                 pricing system and maybe how you haven't                                 used it because I think that you have an                                 interesting case of you know a few                                 hundred thousand products to avoid just                                 using this system yes indeed our                                 approach was that we need to know all                                 the prices of all the courses within the                                 Pratt valid price range and each option                                 has an effect of the price so we're pre                                 generating actual                                                        for a one and a half a year the prices                                 and then we add it thats that we add                                 fees and whatever is possible to these                                 prices as price components so if you                                 choose another date you actually switch                                 the product that's preachin erated so we                                 can skip a whole bunch of very complex                                 logic on execution but in addition to                                 that we have fees that are not possible                                 to pre generate so we use the rules                                 event run mention to edge them on                                 execution                                 so it's it's quite an interesting mix                                 especially because we ours are also                                 handling and multi-currency in several                                 different ways how are you doing                                 currency conversion um we started with a                                 currency price field every currency had                                 had its own price field and if you                                 calculate the sale price we do some gay                                 location look up and whatsoever to data                                 might the matching currency for the user                                 and setting it as price in the Commerce                                 line item okay so you're swapping one                                 price field from the product in for the                                 actual purchase price is that exactly                                 okay that was the start because our                                 customer had the wish to do that for all                                 currency except swiss francs so now we                                 have an exception and swiss friends are                                 help you later door own verdicts on the                                 fly so first result you have to decide                                 actually whether you do some calculation                                 conversion on execution or you have to                                 use this field approach well we see now                                 you can use both of them and I don't                                 know if I all right should announce it                                 but there is a modeling bird right now                                 helps you to decide what to use and                                 helps to switch between these Mobile's                                 it's going to be done by next week                                 commerce right it has to because all                                 right the pressure of an announcement                                 yeah cool and I can't remember yeah so                                 you've sort of combined like using                                 product pricing rules but not just                                 depending on the system entirely was                                 there it was it for performance reasons                                 there was just because you're importing                                 everything from an external database so                                 what exactly caused you to do want to                                 pre compile all these different prices                                 up front well we get the data for the                                 prizes in Excel okay so it's quite fun                                 to get that in a system and there's no                                 Enterprise of sauce planet planning                                 system in place yet okay                                 on our customer side so we decided we                                 just use nearly the axles as they do it                                 internally and the idea was really to                                 have benefit in performance to have all                                 that calculated before because you                                 actually imagine you have school                                 holidays and and national holidays and                                 all that stuff and you have to pre                                 calculate course prices on yet these                                 dates and really heavy operations and                                 doing this for every I think just too                                 much yeah yeah so the idea said that                                 rules is very flexible and powerful as a                                 programming language inside of Drupal                                 but it's not the end-all be-all and                                 there's there's no reason to avoid                                 either writing custom conditions and                                 actions for your pricing rules or to                                 even bypass you know rules-based                                 calculations entirely and sort of                                 precompile and pre calculate all the                                 variations and dump them into the                                 database directly exactly and I have to                                 say to us the planning was done before                                 the price cash which rules wasn't plays                                 yeah and really early yep that's the the                                 joys of being bleeding edge right indeed                                 and so they're not so Peters talked                                 about maybe some of the configuration on                                 the backend and the types of things you                                 can do when you're when you're                                 developing complex pricing systems rich                                 if you wouldn't mind is giving us a                                 brief introduction to that very fuzzy                                 part of the screen up top what you can                                 do whenever you actually displaying a                                 price since you have all of this this                                 price data the component data what went                                 into making this crisis price what have                                 you done to display that in an                                 interesting way for the customer okay so                                 hopefully actually we the case studies                                 we've got a more generic a more sort of                                 simple based stores and and the really                                 important thing again for us here was                                 that especially in Europe in the UK is                                 that v                                                               Google commerce whereas an uber Kai was                                 always a pain and so here we've got dat                                 but because as where I'm are saying                                 prices are calculated by rules it means                                 we can do some really great stuff and so                                 in this particular case this site is                                 that                                 the way live a couple of weeks ago and                                 they were running a special promotion so                                 everything was thirty-three percent off                                 in august and so we were able to write                                 very simple rule that's checked the day                                 before the price is calculated and says                                 okay if the date is before the                                         august we're going to subtract that                                 first three percent off and based on                                 that and the v                                                        able to then split that what you're                                 seeing there it says actually it says                                 RRP and offer price what we've done                                 there is we've taken the component                                 prices and selectively chosen which ones                                 to display so normally you would display                                 the user's cap the customers calculated                                 price which might be based on that as in                                 our case the date or it might be based                                 on a particular role for example if you                                 want to give a roll of discount so you                                 can do all these really really good                                 things with the rules and so what we've                                 done there is we showed the original                                 price prior to calculation as the RRP                                 and then we've shown the customer price                                 which in this case is anyone can come in                                 and get this discount if it's just based                                 on date but we could also have done that                                 using a coupon for example if i put a                                 coupon code in upfront I can see my                                 prices on the site so this is all                                 completely dynamic and you can see the                                 prices that you're each going to pay and                                 that could be completely different                                 depending on who you are because it's                                 all access through rules and again you                                 know we've not done any heavy                                 customization here this is all stuff                                 that's out the box and the views and                                 rules integrations are just so key to                                 this whole project and have made it                                 massively powerful in terms of stuff                                 that before you would have contributed                                 modules all over the place doing this                                 stuff and now this is there's none and                                 one of the one of the strengths i guess                                 it was building on top of drupal sevens                                 field system is that if you need a price                                 to display in a different way like this                                 all you have to do is write a display                                 for matter for it and I mean that the                                 code for that is not that complex that's                                 not yes are you diggin in this case this                                 is a one template that was the only open                                 only override template we had to use for                                 this entire site okay was this because                                 we did the rest in displace week but you                                 know it's very very simple to just make                                 that one change great                                 zoom back out here and then you know                                 we're going to say to that this this                                 product pricing system you know it's                                 even going to handle the same shipping                                 calculations in a similar manner to to                                 what your your product price calculation                                 to determine rights this is pretty new                                 functionality and shipping right Nick                                 yeah we made in like a few weeks ago or                                 something like that okay so so the                                 problem we have having with shipping is                                 that before we use the price components                                 we would create a line item and and                                 display that like you see at the top you                                 know that's the product line item so we                                 would display the shipping line items as                                 well but there wasn't a good way to                                 combine it to you because you know                                 shipping line items and product line                                 items are different you know the product                                 liners have a reference to a product and                                 just shipping line apps don't really                                 have that they don't really want people                                 removing their shipping from the car                                 right yes this is where you have done                                 the shipping so the problem is how do                                 you display that to the customer in a in                                 a good way and the the way we did it was                                 to allow shipping modules to define                                 their own price component so so what we                                 have here you can see we have the                                 subtotal and the endless shipping and                                 then the order tool and that is                                 something that pretty much is handled by                                 commas out of the box because we decided                                 to to define the price component when we                                 created the the shipping line item so we                                 just tell commas oh this is not you use                                 the base price this is the shipping                                 quote and by doing that camas will will                                 spread out the prices as it does with                                 the tax handling and it will it makes a                                 very nice way to display to the customer                                 this is your shipping fee this is like                                 your auto feed is this the Texas and all                                 of that is                                 and and it's very easy to do it i think                                 it was like two or three lines of code                                 and to handle that and and know it works                                 perfectly so the idea that this whole                                 part of the checkout form is a view it                                 can be customized if you want to to                                 include images or extra information                                 attribute information or whatever and                                 then this this this part of the view is                                 what's called an area handler its new                                 two views three instead of just being                                 able to put text into the header of the                                 footer you can plug in you know this                                 this area plugin so this one just takes                                 the order total and uses it's a display                                 form out of the order total fields                                 displayed formatted or split out all the                                 components and so that the idea is that                                 that even though the shipping line item                                 hasn't been displayed in the view itself                                 the view had a filter that said you know                                 only display product line item types is                                 it's not displayed up top but because                                 the shipping line item is on the order                                 and sort of gets added into the order                                 total field whenever we display the                                 order total using the display format of                                 that says hey you break everything out                                 it shows up and you know whenever you're                                 configuring your product pricing rules                                 you even have a select list where you                                 can say which price component should                                 this be so anyone that's been defined on                                 the site or any additional price                                 component that you define in code you                                 can choose so that your store                                 administrators know how to how to                                 register different adjustments to the                                 code or adjustments to the price so                                 we'll move on from there that's the                                 product pricing system it all I was                                 gonna say there's one advantage of it                                 all working through rules this is is I                                 don't know if anybody's using this yet                                 so if you are please raise a hand what                                 we can do is is take all of the                                 permutations of your product prices and                                 just put them into a database table so                                 that you can then sort and filter views                                 based on the calculated price even                                 though that calculation is happening in                                 PHP I don't know that that's being used                                 yet but that's the primary motivation                                 for us to handle all of our price                                 calculation through rules if you're just                                 allowing modules the hook in an altar                                 prices willy-nilly we wouldn't have like                                 any dependable or predictable way to to                                 tell which rules are going to apply for                                 this user and how we join to the table                                 and so on and so forth so if you're                                 interested in that come find me                                 afterwards except I'd love to find you                                 know good people that we can can show                                 off as hey we actually made this work                                 but that's that's why all the product                                 pricing                                 happens through rules if you're curious                                 so the next thing that everybody's had                                 to do here except for Peter because it's                                 client isn't like taking money online is                                 is how should you best integrate with                                 payment services and that if you're if                                 you're looking to find which famous                                 services have already been integrated                                 you can go to drupal commerce dot org                                 slash can't rib and I think there's a                                 list of maybe like two dozen or so                                 payment modules including a                                           module that have been developed for                                 different markets I think the u.s. South                                 America and Europe if's I have some i'm                                 not sure if there's any for asia yet                                 maybe a leap a has been done but the                                 idea is that that drupal commerce                                 defines this core payment system that                                 can on the checkout form process                                 transactions or from the admin forum                                 process transactions and every time a                                 transaction is attempted whether it                                 fails or successful or requires further                                 action like a capture or an e check to                                 clear we create a payment transaction                                 entity and associate it with the user's                                 order and then you have a view of                                 payment transaction entities on the back                                 end that you can go and look at to                                 determine if the order has been paid in                                 full if their payments outstanding or if                                 somebody can't figure out why is my                                 payment keep failing you can actually                                 look at the the API response from the                                 gateway and determine you know what is                                 it that's causing this to fail and so I                                 guess does anybody have anything they'd                                 like to add about you know how you've                                 integrated payment services whether it's                                 from recurring or special needs for                                 European gateways or redirect to                                 gateways that we could just give people                                 an idea if they have to develop their                                 own well defer to I did well the payment                                 system is as its core is also very                                 dependent on rules and that is one thing                                 you need you to understand and it's very                                 jail term and promises                                 you use rules for almost everything                                 because then you can customize it within                                 the interface and and basically when you                                 create a payment method comments will                                 create and a rule for that and you can                                 set up when do you want to apply it we                                 want it to be enabled at all and at what                                 what conditions do you want it so you                                 could create a payment method that would                                 basically skip if if the if the if the                                 other tool was                                                         show that if the order tool is                                          anyway but if you have all that salt                                 iron that that then you want a different                                 payment system and so and what you need                                 to do to actually integrate it is is                                 pretty simple because Karma's will                                 expose some callbacks to your function                                 to allow you to add some form elements                                 if you want to do like in line payment                                 and it will it will call your function                                 at at redirect time you know to to if                                 you want to handle when when the payment                                 is happening offside and all of that and                                 basically what you need to do when when                                 the customer returns is is to send them                                 off to two encoded URL that will tell                                 covers this transaction is okay and                                 commerce call will handle sending the                                 customer to the next step because                                 because of the way you can customize                                 your checkout flow you may have a single                                 form or you may have like multiple steps                                 and you don't know you know how is it                                 customized but comers exposes an API so                                 you just telecoms ok I'm done take it to                                 the next step and that is a good way to                                 share of commerce that is very flexible                                 but the api's for the developers is also                                 very it's very well follow so you you                                 don't have to figure out where to send                                 amuses you                                 let two commas itself yeah this is a big                                 advantage of thing for developers                                 especially in Europe where I think most                                 of your payment is off-site right you go                                 away and you have to come back somewhere                                 and so the idea is that in the u.s. you                                 know most of your most of your stuff is                                 going to be on site so we have helper                                 functions to assist in credit card                                 payment on site so that you have a                                 credit card form credit card validation                                 routines and then of course no storage                                 of any credit card data ever and so that                                 that will get a lot of use in the u.s.                                 gateways and elsewhere but then when                                 you're dealing with all these redirected                                 payment services we really wanted to                                 have the same checkout workflow that you                                 would have if you were paying on site so                                 we don't we don't want to introduce you                                 know to fort you know check out                                 workflows especially on the same side                                 and that's that's I guess where we've                                 kind of been before is that you know the                                 paypal module through Burkhardt had to                                 you know define its own return URLs and                                 its own completion URLs and now we're                                 saying that you know whenever you go out                                 at the same point that you leave the                                 site from is the point that you'll come                                 back to and using the order status we                                 keep track of which step you are at and                                 check out so whenever you come back from                                 the Gateway we know how to send you to                                 the next page and we know if we get a                                 payment notification in whenever you                                 receive a payment notification your                                 module would be responsible for for                                  calling the checkout completion routine                                  that then you know handles all the                                  business logic of an order so as soon as                                  you know payment has been received you                                  are you know telling Drupal commerce to                                  create the user account or send the                                  notification update the order status or                                  so on and then you know it won't                                  duplicate it but whenever the customer                                  comes back from the side then they'll go                                  on to the next page and all as well they                                  don't know and your site doesn't have to                                  know that there were two different types                                  of payment happening so that's it's been                                  a breeze for me because I've                                  traditionally maintained a lot of                                  payment modules and you know we're still                                  churning out more I think you know just                                  by a quick survey on the stage which                                  ones have you integrated or have you                                  used are we starting with Jacob on down                                  I've done the dips and pigs and EP okay                                  now we've been working on this age pay                                  you three directs redirects and form                                  based okay and you guys also did down                                  three ducek here oh yeah and for the                                  direct one we have to do                                            support as well                                  what we tried to do is abstract three                                  years ago out so that other people using                                  direct can use that through your secure                                  cool and we're able to do that by just                                  as I saved with Commerce you're able to                                  define extra check out steps pages or                                  check out pains so we're able to do it                                  that way cool thank you Eric yeah we use                                  done paypal but purely just for                                  subscriptions which is okay slightly                                  different API to the standard one okay                                  yeah yeah I uh I just have a bad history                                  with recurring payments yeah so so it's                                  just it's like the the thorn and                                  everyone's side I think so and they're                                  probably plenty of people out here that                                  have some horror stories about trying to                                  make the kering work you know through                                  burkhard or on Drupal in general so my                                  strategy now is to try to avoid it and                                  to use instead a third party service                                  called recurrently to manage all that                                  stuff these guys were brave and tackle                                  it but you know I'm sure the native                                  solution will be in contribute ventually                                  i'm going to stay away it's actually the                                  coma subscription it started okay that's                                  right yeah kind of should be split out                                  okay will do nicely cool well so in                                  addition to interacting with payment                                  gateways another thing that you're going                                  to be interacting with if you have any                                  sort of custom type store is the line                                  item system and just for a brief                                  introduction to the line item entity                                  what it is it's a default entity type                                  that we define that has a unit price and                                  a total price and the quantity I think                                  that's it and then you'll have different                                  types of line items so these are you                                  define a new type of line item for                                  anything that's going to add to the                                  total of an order so by default you get                                  a product line item type and that's it                                  the shipping module defines a shipping                                  line item type various people have                                  defined their own custom line item types                                  and and what you do is you can add any                                  additional fields to them that you need                                  to capture the data for that line item                                  type so the product line item types all                                  have a product reference field so you                                  don't actually put the product data                                  directly into the line item it just says                                  this line item represents this customer                                  purchasing a product                                                    has that Association I guess you then                                  can access the product data through your                                  rules and through views to display them                                  in the shopping cart                                                      and you can even if you have additional                                  fields through the user interface                                  attached to your line item types you can                                  expose those line item fields through                                  the Add to Cart form to create a sort of                                  customizable product and so the idea                                  there is that you can I guess turn the                                  add to cart from into more of a Prada I                                  don't know how to put a product form you                                  guys I got okay how about a registration                                  form for an event you might put in there                                  there there the real name their email                                  address in their company in the Add to                                  Cart form so you're purchasing a                                  registration you know for a person to                                  that event and you can do this all for                                  the user interface just by adding a fuel                                  to a line item type and clicking the                                  little checkbox that says hey show this                                  on the Add to Cart form and then you                                  know once the user enters that data it's                                  available to you through views to then                                  expose through the cart block through                                  the cart form one use case that we came                                  up with in the training has anybody used                                  the UC variable price module that ever                                  maybe a few okay cool so the idea behind                                  this module is that people wanted to use                                  uber cart for donations and so what we                                  wanted was a product that could have a                                  variable price based on customer entry                                  so we added a this this price field to                                  the the Add to Cart form and then we                                  would store that to mount that the                                  customer entered in the price of the                                  products data array and then whenever                                  uber cart loaded this this cart you know                                  we would alter the price in what we've                                  what we can do now is you can actually                                  just add a custom price field to your                                  line item type and then create a product                                  pricing rule that says you know if this                                  field has data swap it in for the price                                  of the product and so suddenly you were                                  deprecating a lot of modules just by                                  using rules and using views so I think                                  if you could make it pass a mic down to                                  Julian I want to put him on the spot                                  yeah yeah go here because I have here a                                  screenshot from his latest work where                                  he's not just interacting with the line                                  item system to create custom line item                                  types but he's not a fool like                                  customizable product creator right yes                                  sir just explain this to us what's going                                  on here in this page the idea of this                                  project was to be able to create some                                  products pistol by directly through an                                  app flash application                                  and the idea is that you have those                                  buttons with those better you can add                                  some text and some images and you have                                  some something that we call the printing                                  zone where you can add and move and                                  resize and rotate those elements and                                  once you click on the saved                                  crystallization button a thermal eight                                  is generated and this a nail is stored                                  directly directly in the light item as a                                  field that we called the variation and                                  with a custom field type yeah it's the                                  custom field type we are stirring in                                  that XML data for the flash app and we                                  are also use during the path of the Sun                                  nails and an SVG version and the idea is                                  that you can switch with the HTML that                                  you are seeing the different images the                                  colors and you have also the size and                                  printing techniques and this is some                                  advanced HTML is not just a cynically                                  start the radio buttons we had to                                  implement that too and once you are                                  clicking on the Add to Cart form you are                                  going to your cart and in its account we                                  are directly displaying the surveys of                                  the generic products are you closing                                  line item fields through the add to cart                                  for monetary are you using the the                                  functionality to expose fields in the                                  line item to the Add to Cart form yeah                                  okay which which where would that be                                  represented on the page is that just                                  this the design bar yeah okay yeah so I                                  mean what I find really missing about                                  this project is that it's still using                                  the basic add to cart from just right                                  out of the box so you have you know your                                  quantity selector you have attribute                                  selectors so if you've attached a size                                  attribute to this product type or a                                  color one you know those are still                                  showing up here but it's like you've                                  totally you know combine that with the                                  custom line item type to create just                                  like a whole custom interface for                                  building products so I'm really excited                                  about the project and this this actually                                  comes up a lot is these are these radio                                  buttons that you've seemed to look like                                  images actually because in HTML you                                  can't really use some random Adams edge                                  markup inside some labels and stuff like                                  that we're at use some JavaScript to                                  make sure that we are still using                                  kind of degraded version but it's really                                  tickled the radio buttons and some                                  JavaScript ok so there's radio button                                  just hidden that those images on that                                  too all right cool yes and that that                                  feature of course actually comes up a                                  lot in the the issue queue how can i                                  take the add to cart from and actually                                  use graphical you know selectors for for                                  various attributes and really some kind                                  of example code for that I mean oh yeah                                  have we here we will William alright an                                  announcement now you're on the spot                                  great thanks la Julian and Julian is our                                  lead Devon or senior dev I don't know                                  exactly the title but in Paris he's the                                  guy so thanks for the N all right the                                  next question is maybe more maybe                                  pre-sales or business oriented what                                  exactly should you keep in mind when                                  quoting complex drupal commerce projects                                  and i know at least two of you have                                  worked on very complex sites i know that                                  we've quoted some sadame Ian if you want                                  to if you want the same thing you'd be                                  welcome to but if you have any advice                                  for us and when we're developing with                                  Drupal commerce is there anything                                  specific to what it the way the Commerce                                  works that is going to send the price up                                  or maybe allow you to bid a lower price                                  but how does Lex is that worked out for                                  you rich yeah and we found actually                                  probably in common with not specifically                                  to commerce projects but then is content                                  really and getting people to get their                                  content together if we if we don't have                                  that up front we really don't know what                                  the job is going to be like and so with                                  commerce specifically there is a                                  slightly may be difficult to explain why                                  I've doing products in that you have a                                  product and you have a product display                                  and I I am now fully on board with why                                  that is but then it can't be a little                                  bit of a difficult one to explain to to                                  a customer and and the reason it is like                                  it I mean in my opinion anyways so you                                  can do stop control on individual items                                  and and you can have variable pricing as                                  well and so we found that to be a little                                  bit difficult to to explain and                                  that message across and and also i guess                                  the making sure that we know what the                                  gateway is going to be at this stage of                                  commerce development not every gateway                                  is going to be available and so                                  obviously bear that in mind if you're                                  looking at commerce project is that it                                  gate where develop me is not physically                                  difficult in in commerce distiller text                                  active active in yeah okay so what                                  you're saying is look at the pieces that                                  are providing and what custom                                  development am I going to have to do                                  around importing and maintaining the                                  product catalog and capturing payment                                  and us that's right and also one that                                  always comes up is tracking are they                                  using some sort of special tracking                                  affiliate tracking mainly what I'm                                  talking about obviously a one has google                                  analytics these days but often will need                                  to put tracking on the checkout process                                  in various places often multiple check                                  out and since then that's another one                                  just looking out for because that's                                  where you start to get into custom                                  custom work and one thing that came up                                  in our buff discussions in the the                                  commerce Minicon over in the the other                                  college was the idea that there are many                                  different types of site administrators                                  many different people that will be                                  interacting with this e-commerce site                                  and the backend of drupal commerce is                                  going to be fairly intimidating for most                                  of them because it is it's just a set of                                  views and it's some rules and if they                                  want to customize any of this stuff                                  they're going to have to be technical                                  drupal users and so I think you know                                  what we've done on projects is it's                                  really built an entire custom back end                                  and that's part of the reason we                                  separated out the UI from the API                                  modules in the core commerce package it                                  so that you could do stuff like this                                  whether it's building your custom views                                  building custom pages dashboard widgets                                  or whatever you want to keep in mind how                                  exactly will the people that are going                                  to be using this site need to interact                                  with the backend of the site because                                  you're going to end up doing a lot of                                  that development I don't suppose any of                                  you guys have done any like vacuum                                  customization we we tend to at least do                                  minimal customization of P of the                                  initial views out of the box just to add                                  some filters and stuff like that okay                                  and it's just tweaking the UI really to                                  meet the customers requirements okay and                                  I think Peter you were really helped on                                  euro centers by having like was it like                                  you know                                                                yeah                                  yeah I think one problem that arises                                  with Commerce is you can do nearly                                  everything so you have to know what the                                  customer wants or bring the customer to                                  know what he really wants that's not                                  like you recovered you have some some                                  kind of a closed features that and you                                  have a dead end and you can say it                                  custom well that's simply not possible                                  or too expensive with this framework                                  approach it's really a good investment                                  to create very specific and detailed                                  concepts and it won't work always like                                  we we decided for this multi-currency                                  field approach and it looks promising                                  and really yeah that well was what the                                  customer wanted but you know the euro                                  got weaker and lands on when they                                  decided well we should be more flexible                                  with Swiss friends and other stuff so                                  even their know that I yeah I do it okay                                  good thanks I guess we'll move on from                                  that question if anybody has anything                                  else you'd like to add we're gonna do                                  Q&A in just a second some the final                                  question and I'll just feel this one is                                  where can you go for development support                                  and how can you give feedback or give                                  back to the project and the primary                                  places that you'll find myself and                                  others are in IRC on the same IRC free                                  no net the channel is pound drupal dash                                  commerce and you'll find me in there at                                  way too many hours of the day if you                                  need that to just talk with me about                                  contributing or figure out how the core                                  works we're also really working the                                  issue queue like like madmen so we're                                  turning through issues and trying to                                  make sure that we're closing stuff out                                  as fast as possible so bug reports                                  should go there future requests you know                                  maybe should go there support requests                                  shouldn't go there so the issue queue is                                  not being used for support we do have                                  drupal commerce out of work and we have                                  some tools pinning that Randy's                                  developed for us that I have been                                  negligent and following up with him on                                  but what we are we are using forms at                                  least for now and we're looking at how                                  to better use Drupal commerce org as a                                  support center for at least in a form                                  type support and then of course if you                                  need you know official you know paid for                                  support is always the Aqua                                  yeah ecommerce support stuff that we're                                  doing now additionally if you're looking                                  for you know training and things like                                  that commerce guys offers training in                                  our office but there's also often                                  training going on in conjunction with                                  drupal camps and rubicon so of course we                                  did a full day of training that we sold                                  out on monday and i think we blew some                                  people's minds and then we had at least                                  one person i was dissatisfied because he                                  was already a developer and we were                                  teaching about like how to use the core                                  modules not how to hack into him deeper                                  but you know we are we do try to provide                                  a broad overview of Commerce and all the                                  functionality and we are developing a                                  more developer oriented curriculum that                                  we've been sort of field testing on some                                  of our partners and maturing and then                                  there's also this commerce camp if you                                  don't have anything to do next weekend                                  and you're recovered from drupalcon it's                                  in switzerland in how do you say is at                                  lose an okay so it's in Luzerne and it's                                  two days totally free I imagine that's a                                  camp about websites that make money was                                  able to get enough sponsorship to make                                  it free for everybody to come so they'll                                  be discussing not just drupal commerce                                  it's more like the business of doing                                  business with Drupal and there will be                                  commerce sessions and I Peter's doing a                                  couple and some of the Commerce guys are                                  and I'm not sure if there's any training                                  going on but maybe there is so yeah and                                  so then you know if you want to give                                  back there's a lot of contributed                                  modules that have been developed that                                  need either co-main tanners and there's                                  still a lot of stuff that needs to be                                  done so so my goal now that the one dot                                                                                                        into what essential contributed modules                                  do we need to to get down and get ready                                  so that drupal commerce in a sort of can                                  begin to compete at the application                                  feature set level on the strength of all                                  of its contributed modules so we'll be                                  diving in to contribute back or help out                                  with some contribs and stuff so if i                                  could maybe get maybe one one of each of                                  you to go down each aisle and we have a                                  few minutes left for QA if anybody would                                  like to just pose a question what's                                  about developing with drupal commerce i                                  know we didn't actually show any code                                  but i'm happy to answer code questions                                  and pull up my ID if you want but if you                                  just have rules and views questions feel                                  free to ask those too we got one right                                  here in the front                                  hey I'm interested in this customer                                  profile entity you've got I'm working                                  with the CRM coach spring tomorrow okay                                  I was wondering if is that in a                                  standalone module somewhere that we can                                  play with would that be worth building                                  our CRM on top of or is it worth kind of                                  going around way with it I see where we                                  end up yeah we we talked about                                  integration possibilities with modules                                  like profile to or core profiles at                                  first but what we determine is that a                                  customer profile in commerce is maybe a                                  bit of a unique case because it may have                                  an address it may not it may just be                                  there for the purposes of collecting a                                  tax ID it's kind of it's just like                                  information that you need as a store to                                  be able to complete the order and they                                  could have a one-to-many relationship to                                  users and we could have one customer                                  profile that's shared by multiple users                                  such as multiple people from the same                                  organization we're using the same                                  billing data or shipping data so it's in                                  the customer module I'm not sure that                                  it's going to be super useful for you                                  but feel free to come look at the code                                  afterwards if you want and I can of them                                  a few there is there is an address field                                  module that should be useful for you                                  though so it's a standalone contribute a                                  me ins been writing that and it provides                                  you know the Ajax II multi-country                                  address entry field for name and first                                  name and organization name and                                  everything so that may be useful to you                                  then we had a question up here                                  yeah was there any sales people or                                  marketing orient people involved in the                                  development process of trouble commerce                                  any sales are marketing people yes um                                  other than the guys that we've had at                                  Commerce guys there hasn't been like a                                  whole lot of contributions from that                                  area are you thinking about in terms of                                  just how to market the project itself or                                  how to build the project for marketers                                  using the site the last part second okay                                  well there hasn't been much coming in so                                  far in fact in the core we don't                                  actually have any dashboard widgets for                                  example so what I've heard is that                                  there's a company called live link                                  that's been investigating how to use                                  commerce for you know marketers and how                                  to customize the back in for internet                                  marketers in for sales people and you                                  know if we're lucky some of that work                                  will end up in maybe a commerce                                  dashboard module or something and I just                                  talked to them briefly about it at a                                  bobb session so I'm not tying them to                                  anything but they're the only people                                  that I know of so far a lot of what                                  we've been doing in developing at                                  Commerce guys is how to you know market                                  you know in e-commerce framework in a                                  world where most people are evaluating                                  ecommerce applications so ours have been                                  more from the sales of the actual                                  project itself rather than how to manage                                  the sales of the products you can't you                                  know you're actually selling so any                                  other questions you got                                                   back here                                  could you could you summarize please the                                  state of play with regard to marketplace                                  functionality so sure what's the best                                  strategy in your view and are there any                                  common pitfalls thanks Jamie I don't                                  suppose you want to give the mic to                                  Damian no no oh you want me in the                                  summer it was your bath okay okay there                                  was I'll tell you there was a bath                                  yesterday where people did discuss                                  marketplace functionality so multiple                                  stores different types of approaches to                                  check out with that whether you need to                                  have just different cards per store or                                  somehow perform the checkout process                                  twice for each of the different products                                  and there's is there's sort of a                                  consensus that it's going to be                                  developed soon there's also consensus                                  that the core modules themselves are                                  likely flexible enough as is at                                          one patch acts I did commit a patch                                  yesterday for that too to allow multiple                                  store entities to sell products and then                                  to allow split shopping carts you know                                  for the different types of for the                                  different sellers represented in a                                  customer's career in order so there's                                  there's we actually developed a client                                  site that uses marketplace yet okay yeah                                  yeah so uh Boyan he actually had to fly                                  home but his screen name is Boyan z and                                  so you can find him and i think there                                  will be a separate contribut place on                                  Commerce and then you know there's                                  there's the core functionality it's                                  already there with our extensible into                                  the access control even down to the line                                  item level on and give an order so I                                  don't think we'll be in sort of an                                  Access Controller permissions hole it's                                  more just adding the store entity and                                  making sure whether that's an organic                                  group or something else and making sure                                  that we can tag products for that and                                  separate out the checkout work so I'm                                  pretty positive that it's going to be                                  happening soon and boy yawns already                                  working on it huh we had a question in                                  here I think oh if you could use the mic                                  please oh yeah this guy right here yeah                                  you're good PT yeah yeah this guy this                                  guy up top okay we'll go for Jeffers                                  sorry is there any effort to or is there                                  already contributing                                  modules to integrate with erp systems                                  inventory systems or other accounting                                  systems are you aware of any Damian yeah                                  nothing nothing generic I mean we've                                  done some use case specific stuff for                                  various clients but nothing generic                                  other than to say that everything in                                  commerce is an entity so everything that                                  has data on it is that either field data                                  or a property that Drupal knows how to                                  access through its side either into the                                  field query in core or the entity API                                  and contributed Atta whether it's                                  through views or through feeds or you                                  know if you're bringing it in through my                                  grade like that's possible but there's                                  nothing like hey this is the ERP                                  connection module or yeah thought of                                  doing that kids I mean I mean maybe                                  customer wolf it'll be great you know                                  haha all right but it's kind of a matter                                  of finding a client that needs it and                                  then finding a generic solution that                                  works for them and can work for other                                  people soundings yeah and then we had                                  one I think like five rows back will do                                  yeah it's Peter you get the Mike the guy                                  up top and then love to eat it's just a                                  small remark there's a showcase at page                                  on your side yes but not all those sides                                  are me yeah I guess we need to fix that                                  huh there's a wiki page on drupal                                  commerce org called things just drupal                                  commerce org slash showcase it's a wiki                                  where you can just go and thrown a link                                  and sort of add a little bit of a blurb                                  about how commerce was used on a                                  particular site so there's some really                                  really sharp looking sites i mean i                                  think that euro centers to me is kind of                                  like the pinnacle of Drupal                                    development I think it's a really really                                  sharp side really complex and really                                  puts Drupal                                                             but there's some other really nice sites                                  like koziol that demonstrates you know                                  the right to left functionality and a                                  hebrew with using Hebrew and I guess                                  it's an Israeli store there's some other                                  nice sites and then just sort of get you                                  a broader feel for what people have done                                  with commerce and I think this will be                                  the last question because I think people                                  are getting cleaner okay wait I've lost                                  my question no no I got it multilanguage                                  is always a pain in the ass                                  how does the how did the panel people                                  respond to that because how do you have                                  you have best practices or tips yeah to                                  handle multi-language you're standing                                  right by the guy so I'll let Peter into                                  that one well we went straight for                                  entity translation because imagine like                                  something like dat n notes ink on                                                                                                      languages no chance but it works quite                                  good with anti translation even if it's                                  not really released yet I guess I have                                  to talk to the maintainer I premised it                                  Jose young Cabo that will talk to him                                  tomorrow we put patches in the core for                                  both into translation and i                                             that's important yeah yeah so I mean                                  when you're dealing with that with                                  Drupal commerce because we've separated                                  out the definition of a product from how                                  its displayed and where it's displayed                                  there's not much to translate on the                                  product itself other than the title and                                  then if you're using attributes you know                                  the attribute options when you get into                                  that your attributes in in Drupal                                  commerce or just fields and so it's just                                  translating field data so if you're                                  selling t-shirts and you need to have                                  you know small medium and large for the                                  size translated into different languages                                  you just add a field to your product                                  type and you can have that show up on                                  the Add to Cart form and then you need                                  to make sure that Drupal knows that this                                  is a field that should be translated                                  whether it's through the entity                                  translation module or through I attend                                  well there is i                                                           the other stuff is mostly aunty                                  translation and title module great yeah                                  so um let's go ahead and close the                                  general Q&A there and if you have any                                  further questions for myself for the                                  panel or any of the Commerce guys will                                  hang around up front until we just get                                  something where you have to go and we'd                                  be happy to hear from you to talk with                                  you we do appreciate your time and                                  attention so good luck with the common                                  you
