Title: DrupalCon London 2011: SO WHAT'S THIS "DREW-PAUL" THING YOU DO?
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
David Needham
You're introduced to someone by a friend. The smalltalk begins and you know what's coming.

They ask, "What do you do?" The friend who introduced you tries to understand your explanation yet again.

You say, "Um, I do Drupal." They stare back blankly as you continue.

"...it's a content management system - you know, a CMS?"

You shudder as you try again, "...it's kinda like WordPress?" Still nothing.

Eventually you give in and explain it in a way that even your grandmother could understand: "I build websites."

Finally the look of realization comes across their face, but you feel dead inside.

---

This scenario is reenacted every time you meet someone. You're passionate about Drupal, but because of one reason or another you're unable to talk to people about it. Things get even more interesting if you start with your job title, in my case it's "Drupal themer and trainer." Great - at least one more term that I have to explain in gross generality.

I eventually give up and answer "I'm a web designer" to anyone who asks. Everyone does it. It makes things easier, but in today's culture it's a rather vague and unhelpful term to describe what we really do.

Intended audience
This session walks through some 'Drupal best practices' to explain your role to people who are unfamiliar with Drupal. We'll also cover techniques for combating know-it-all's and Drupal-haters, as well as ways to explain Drupal to your friends and colleagues.

Questions answered by this session
What is Drupal and what is the history behind it?

How do I explain Drupal to someone who isn't familair with it?

How do I convince my boss or coworkers that Drupal is the way to go?

How can I market myself as someone looking for a freelance or full time job in Drupal?

How does "Certified to Rock" work and how do I increase my score?

to be a little bit of                                an open forum we're going to be                                discussing I'm going to be speaking from                                my personal experiences but you know                                like like most things you know I'm sure                                that you each have your own opinion and                                especially when it comes to things                                internationally like I've only had                                experienced telling people about Drupal                                in America so if you are not from                                America or you have more experience                                speaking in other countries i would                                definitely appreciate you giving your                                own opinion or and when things differ                                when when maybe something i say it may                                not be true somewhere else please you                                know speak up and just let us know so                                that myself and everyone else can                                benefit from that and if you wave your                                hand madly I'll come with the mic and                                then it'll be recorded for posterity                                that's right so the slides and the mic                                audio is all being recorded so if you                                want to check this out later it will be                                posted on the page for this session on                                drupalcon london so as we said we work                                for chapter                                                           kate is the training coordinator chapter                                three is a small ish web design shop a                                drupal shop in san francisco california                                everything that we do is in Drupal you                                know training we do you know the actual                                design we do the the site building                                development I'm kind of the full                                spectrum and along the way I learned                                that there were several different types                                of people and for each one of them you                                have to kind of describe what Drupal is                                in a different way so this this all                                stemmed from it was actually Kate's idea                                to begin with and extend from this this                                idea of the first time that you meet                                someone whenever you're introduced to                                someone you know some free                                then or maybe you're speaking to a                                client or you know whatever the case                                might be they always end up asking so                                you know what's this Drupal thing or you                                know when you meet someone new you're                                introduced to them they always ask what                                is it you know what do you do and you                                say oh I you know I build Drupal                                websites or something like that and you                                know for the most part depending what                                group you're in they may not know what                                Drupal is and depending on that you have                                to kind of adjust this description of                                what exactly you think triple is so I                                say I build Drupal websites this is the                                sort of look I always get kind of a                                blank stare they're not exactly sure                                it's like you know Drupal what's that so                                first off kind of the the average person                                you have to be very basic with your                                description i'd say like drupal lets me                                build websites that help people build                                their own websites without needing to                                know anything about programming so you                                know to the most simplest simple isn't                                the right way to put it but for people                                who maybe not don't have a technical                                background you can say that you build                                websites that help other people kind of                                build their own websites you provide the                                structure a Drupal helps you provide the                                structure that they otherwise wouldn't                                have you know people that don't know                                HTML don't know CSS don't know PHP don't                                need to know any of those things in                                order to keep their website going to                                keep updating and maintaining their                                website along the way and then there's                                IT people so you know you might be                                working in a company where you know it's                                not a Drupal shop and you have to                                explain what Drupal is to IT people to                                kind of geeky you know server-side you                                know Lennox people which is fine I know                                 there are some of those here so I don't                                 mean to offend if that's the case so in                                 that case i would say Drupal is an open                                 source system for managing content and                                 displaying it on the web there's no                                 software install works on every                                 operating system even a mobile browser                                 and it's modular so you have to be in                                 this case I found it is better to be a                                 little bit more technical you know they                                 get a little bit more meat they can kind                                 of understand a little bit more about                                 what Drupal is meant for                                 as well as you know the modular bit will                                 help them to kind of help embrace it so                                 that you can say hey you know this is a                                 modular system I can extend upon it i                                 can save tons of time i can save money                                 you know I can save you know do good                                 things for the company by using some                                 things that other people have done so I                                 can you know take those things and you                                 know put them into my website put them                                 into our company website and save                                 everyone a lot of hassle and then of                                 course there's Drupal people I believe                                 this is from Copenhagen if we're at a                                 convention like we are now in drupalcon                                 you can be very open you can skip over                                 all Oh Drupal is open source or whatever                                 you know if someone comes up to you here                                 and they say hey you know what do you do                                 you can say oh I'm a drupal theme are                                 you know I have a theme on drupal.org I                                 I go to this oh I went to Copenhagen i                                 went to drupalcon San Francisco                                 drupalcon Chicago you can say hey I                                 volunteer maybe I help you know present                                 I help to actually run some of these                                 conferences and you can get in a lot                                 more depth you can be a little bit more                                 prideful a little bit you know proud of                                 what you do and you can kind of explain                                 that to them in a totally different way                                 um so I I found this out I i didn't i                                 didn't find out the hard way fortunately                                 but like when i was on the plane and I                                 was filling up my little custom sheet I                                 did not put drupal i do drupal it's an                                 open source ba ba ba i just put i build                                 websites or web designer of course you                                 know if you're speaking to someone who                                 really doesn't care what you do you know                                 if they're the authorities if they're                                 you know someone who's maybe just being                                 polite I still just say i build websites                                 there's kind of no way around that i                                 found so based on this sort of structure                                 you know a translating drupal in a                                 different way for each individual group                                 of people you're able to give very brief                                 descriptions but you know in order to                                 speak more more                                 only if they have questions about hey                                 well you know that's cool where the trip                                 will come from you kind of need to know                                 a little bit of the history so if you                                 don't know already I'm just going to                                 give a brief history about where drupal                                 came from Drupal was started in                                         jury speed your chart I'm sure you all                                 know him if you haven't had a chance to                                 meet him he's the the giant with a spiky                                 hair I just shake his hand is pretty                                 cool he was at college with his friends                                 and he basically needed a way to                                 communicate with them he had to he                                 wanted to let them know hey what's going                                 on oriol to share things people talk                                 about different events that might be                                 going on basically he wanted to build                                 facebook unofficially it wasn't like                                 Facebook for everyone is just facebook                                 for his friends just a way to                                 communicate a way to talk about their                                 own things so he created the system he                                 you know was in college he did all this                                 and then afterwards you decided you know                                 hate you know other people can benefit                                 from this so the next year he decided to                                 publish it online he said okay well what                                 would be a good name for this he said                                 that it's sort of like a community sort                                 of like a village so he decided to name                                 the first name for Drupal was dorp which                                 in Dutch if you don't know he's from                                 Belgium and dutchess community and if                                 someone if I'm getting this wrong                                 someone please finish village thank you                                 um so he named it dorp he went online                                 he's going to look for a domain name he                                 goes to type it in and he makes the typo                                 instead of typing in dorg he types in                                 drop gorg and dropped org is available                                 so he thinks hey you know it's it's not                                 every day that you can get a four                                 character domain name let alone                                 something as cool as drop so he buys                                 dropped org renamed the project to grab                                 help me with the pronunciation like                                 drupal                                 anyone ok ok so it's truffle and it gets                                 popular other people know about it comes                                 you know America we pronounce it                                 horribly we can't get it right we mess                                 it up we miss pronounce it we misspelled                                 it and it's just not working so he                                 decides to make it a little bit simpler                                 we keep trying to pronounce it drupal                                 and so he print out her he renames the                                 project to be as it is today Drupal so                                 it's much easier of course we still get                                 people who try to pronounce it like Drew                                 Paul we do a lot of trainings and it's                                 kind of funny will be people at the very                                 beginning they'll say drew Paul and you                                 can kind of tell about like what sort of                                 experience I've had with the community                                 or whatnot but um so that's the basic                                 history of Drupal if you're wondering                                 about worthy like drupal accom the                                 little drop came from that was kind of                                 an iterative design process started with                                 a droplet in a circle and it kind of                                 progressed they're playing with                                 different ideas and they realized if you                                 put two droplets kind of side by side it                                 looks like the affinity symbol so if you                                 if you make the infinity symbol you put                                 it within a drop all right inside of a                                 circle it sort of looks like eyes so if                                 you look you can still see the infinity                                 symbol as the eyes of the drop they                                 added the face in the nose and drupalcon                                 was born so also Drupal is open source                                 you can talk about this for a long time                                 if you don't know this is Neil drum                                 corps maintainer of Drupal                                            out of our office so I just had to                                 include a picture of him and Drupal is                                 open source so a lot of people when you                                 first tell them this you know you say                                 hey anyone can see the code you know                                 it's a collaborative thing anyone can                                 work on it you get a lot of flack                                 sometimes from especially maybe not the                                 IT people who are into linux because i                                 kind of get it but you know maybe your                                 boss may be anyone who                                 um might be a little bit less technical                                 but a little bit you know they think                                 their technical they might hear open                                 source they might think oh well that                                 sounds horribly insecure it sounds like                                 you know inefficient you know how am I                                 supposed to get support how am I                                 supposed to make sure it'll work exactly                                 how I want it to and as you should all                                 know by now like Drupal is one of the                                 most secure if not these secure the most                                 secure content management system today                                 just because because everyone can see                                 the code because we have so many                                 talented people at drupalcon today and                                 you know throughout the world they look                                 at the code they make suggestions gets                                 improved and it keeps going going going                                 and keeps getting better keeps getting                                 cleaner and so I mean just try to use                                 whatever experience you have in the                                 community just to describe open source                                 and that sort of way and of course there                                 are always people who say well hey you                                 know drupal sucks i only use wordpress                                 or you know i only use joomla you know                                 and and certainly there are some cases                                 where wordpress or maybe joomla would be                                 okay don't don't come up here and like a                                 mob and beat me up for that but you know                                 if you're building just a simple blog                                 site you don't need any additional                                 functionality you don't need anything                                 you know too fancy just a very simple                                 blog site with probably just like one                                 person on it WordPress is totally okay                                 the WordPress is really good at doing                                 just a simple blog site if you want                                 anything more than that if you want                                 something with a little bit more meat a                                 little bit more power of course you                                 could use Drupal but even then you'll                                 get people you'll get critics who can                                 pretty much never agree that Drupal is                                 good for anything and in those cases you                                 kind of just have to roll with it and                                 agree to disagree this is a great                                 opportunity does anyone have a good                                 story about maybe a someone who is                                 against WordPress I mean against Drupal                                 is in favor WordPress can someone share                                 something                                 no wow yep yeah just wait for like                                 okay I don't have a story but where work                                 we are used to use WordPress and of                                 course we are not against robot because                                 I'm here but we actually we feel like                                 wordpress we can build great websites                                 sorry no it's true you can build great                                 websites with Drupal but it is                                 incredibly limited you know if you try                                 to grow beyond what WordPress is made                                 for it becomes pretty difficult to add                                 in those additional things I that's what                                 I've personally found okay yeah thanks                                 alright so the other side of this is                                 maybe you're trying to describe what you                                 know you know your Drupal skills or                                 whatnot to a Drupal shop or to a                                 freelance client or you know whatever                                 stroke lick can I get a hand count who                                 in here works

                             have the background you know I kind of                                 learned a little bit about what it takes                                 to get work in the triple job like in                                 the Drupal field for in freelance work                                 and I found that if you want a job in                                 Drupal if you want to you know find work                                 if you want to know if you're freelance                                 looking for clients or maybe you're                                 looking for an official like official                                 job with a shop or something it's always                                 good to have a resume if you're                                 targeting people if you're talking                                 clients they may not always care about                                 that it's Drupal it's always good to                                 have kind of Drupal separated it's                                 always good to have just something you                                 can show people to say hey here's my my                                 drupal skills you know here's the things                                 that I'm good at in Drupal and that goes                                 for the portfolio as well you know maybe                                 you you have a lot of experience                                 building themes and you want to show                                 this off well obviously you should have                                 those up on your own your own website in                                 a portfolio so you can show you know                                 here's all the stuff that I'm good at                                 because if you show it to a Drupal shop                                 like someone that that only does Drupal                                 stuff they probably don't care about you                                 know what you've done in some of the                                 other things you know maybe they're                                 there they think it's interesting that                                 you know flash or something else but                                 maybe they don't so much care about that                                 as much as the Drupal stuff also on the                                 next to hear you know helping the                                 community is                                 pretty much the best way to get a job                                 and that's that's how I was actually                                 hired it at chapter three drupal shops

volunteered at something like this                                 before it's a great way to again just                                 like help out the community to kind of                                 rub shoulders and meet new people I got                                 my job at chapter three because i went                                 to drupalcon san francisco and i                                 volunteered for every time slot so i                                 didn't choose like what sessions i                                 wanted to go to I volunteered for every                                 time slot and I said okay send me to a                                 room I'll be a room monitor and so I                                 hopped around room to room and I did                                 that and some of the people at chapter                                 three who were helping to run drupalcon                                 San Francisco kind of noticed and they                                 asked me to interview and so it ended up                                 with a job I can't guarantee that you                                 all get jobs if you volunteer for                                 everything and it is kind of a time sink                                 as well but you know it's again like I                                 wasn't doing it for the job I was doing                                 because I enjoyed                                 the people I enjoyed helping out and                                 that is exactly what they were looking                                 for so certified to rock a lot of you                                 have asked what is certified to rock how                                 does it work well basically you type in                                 your drupal org username and if you                                 don't know this is a website called                                 certified iraq com if you type in your                                 drupal org username like greece it'll                                 give you a score and if you type in like                                 another name like one of our founders                                 Josh Koenig you can see oh here's                                 another score and if you type in someone                                 like me it's not a great school um so if                                 you type in your name and it's not the                                 area if it doesn't come up with anything                                 don't be afraid don't don't worry it                                 doesn't register everyone on there it                                 only registers people who have reached                                 kind of a certain point and the way that                                 it works is it takes all the things that                                 are measurable on drupal org it looks at                                 the things that would have your name                                 you're a drupal user name on it and it                                 uses those to kind of add points to give                                 yourself a score on certified to rock so                                 you know any something you leave a                                 comment any time that you are mentioned                                 or you say something an issue queue                                 whenever you help people in there ask                                 for help your score can go up a little                                 bit I'm also if you submit patches you                                 know if you say hey you know there's                                 this problem to this module you know                                 here's a patch to fix that and then even                                 better if the module maintainer includes                                 that you know if they pull that patch                                 into their module and it's accepted then                                 again your score keeps going out and                                 then of course if you become a                                 maintainer Orko maintainer of a module                                 or theme your score keeps on going up                                 additionally i mentioned well i didn't                                 mention but if you do documentation you                                 know documentation is is pretty massive                                 it's a massive undertaking on drupal org                                 just to keep everything up to date to                                 keep everything relevant to you know                                 Drupal                                                              and so any time that you can update any                                 of that and and kind of keep it relevant                                 if you try something that doesn't work                                 right you know consider updating the                                 documentation to reflect what didn't                                 work for you or you know if you did get                                 it to work then you know what steps you                                 took to do that and then additionally                                 they can manually add in some some extra                                 points for things like if you have an                                 active role in cons camps etc you know                                 if the people at rowing venture if you                                 see maybe you can't see as well it's                                 growing venture solutions under the                                 company that kind of constructed the                                 system if they're notified if you know                                 if there's a camp if there's a con and                                 they're notified that hey this person                                 has this person was in charge of doing                                 this particular thing at the camp you                                 know then they say okay great you know                                 give us you know give us a number of I                                 think it's like                                                         of a job now we'll go to the job but                                 like how important they were like what                                 they did you know what was their score                                 for that and then your points can go up                                 in that way so if you're involved if you                                 have an official capacity or even if you                                 volunteer sometimes they can put in some                                 stuff they're generally just be awesome                                 I mean it's it's very general but you                                 know if you do good things in Drupal if                                 you do good things in the community and                                 you you know even if you don't do it to                                 be noticed chances are you will be                                 noticed eventually you know people will                                 see all the good things you're doing and                                 you'll get credit for so I took this                                 quote from the twitter at drupal truth                                 the drupal information minister if you                                 don't follow him he's pretty hilarious                                 but i asked him what is Drupal for the                                 sake of this presentation he said what                                 is Drupal it's the last thing you'll see                                 before your cast into the pit for your                                 insolent questions                                 so yeah it's a very tongue-in-cheek sort                                 of Twitter account but definitely check                                 it out and that's all I officially have                                 I would definitely like I said this is a                                 swordsman is a discussion so I welcome                                 questions comments additional topics if                                 you all have anything to talk about                                 and I don't really understand this rock                                 thing and I mean for example I've been                                 the project leader for drupalcamp in                                 Stockholm it was well last time and I                                 haven't put it on the drupal org profile                                 or something um is it a link from drupal                                 org to depend real understand how you                                 can I don't understand really okay oh                                 it's working well yeah if you were                                 involved with a camp rock on if you if                                 you ran it or helps run it um then you                                 or someone else that's is an official                                 capacity of that group will notify                                 growing venture solutions to say you                                 know we you know here are the people                                 that are involved please you know reward                                 them for for for helping out and then                                 your points gets increased so you have                                 to for those things because they can't                                 they can't there's no way to like                                 automatically check to see what there is                                 and so you have to notify them and let                                 them know that that there are points it                                 should be given out for them it's good                                 to update your profile ooh I think yeah                                 it's always good to update your profile                                 keep things relevant if you have                                 attended you know drupal camps and cons                                 and if you do you know documentation                                 when I always mark those things on your                                 profile too Thanks yep and also i should                                 say like if it's not an instantaneous                                 thing it takes a long time for for                                 things to kind of go through the system                                 and they only update it the only update                                 scores about twice a year so if you've                                 done something if you've been part of a                                 camp if you you know helped with to you                                 know this today if you've recently                                 started doing a module or theme you may                                 not see points for that for several                                 months it just it takes a while for them                                 to go through everything                                 any more questions or discussion topics                                 I didn't do it Jessie had to walk away                                 from them the back to the front our                                 company I atomic we've got officers in                                 Australia and we've got them here in                                 England and sometimes when we get a                                 picture for jobs sometimes we directly                                 get asked for Drupal as a CMS and                                 sometimes it's just don't care what it                                 is so I was wondering you know in the                                 states do you do you get fresh by people                                 who only want Drupal or do you have the                                 same same such thing as well I would say                                 it's generally the same we get lots of                                 people who come to us for Drupal I mean                                 we are a Drupal shop we only do drupal                                 stuff so lots of people will come to us                                 for Drupal but then there are several                                 other you know job leads that we hear                                 about where maybe we're applying you                                 know we're putting a bid in for a                                 project where it's just a project like                                 they don't care they don't care if we                                 use Drupal or you know whatever so both                                 yeah                                 any sort of standard blur I                                 believe that there is something on our                                 website chapter three Comm if not I've                                 definitely seen things on on several                                 websites where where they say here's why                                 we do drupal or why do we care and it                                 kind of goes through those things but it                                 touches on several of the things that we                                 already know like you know it is a                                 content management system it goes                                 through and it's a modular system so it                                 saves the client lots of time and money                                 and not having to redo the wheel every                                 time does that answer your question yeah                                 in the back                                 you                                 hi I'm Jenny and I woke in the user                                 experience area and Drupal is brand new                                 to me this week but I have come across                                 people at our organization who when I                                 mentioned the word Drupal they're like                                 why on earth we're moving our website to                                 Drupal it's crap but literally in those                                 words and obviously I have no comeback                                 and it and because I don't mean I'm                                 still learning so is there like a bullet                                 list of comebacks a bullet list of                                 comebacks that sounds like a good thing                                 for me to add to this presentation                                 actually I mean it really depends a                                 little bit on what their problem is with                                 Drupal and this can kind of go hand in                                 hand with the the the WordPress slide                                 that I put in where you know why would                                 you choose Drupal wat hy know why not                                 WordPress and there are several reasons                                 I mean there's like I said it really                                 depends on what their their criticisms                                 are of Drupal                                 e                                 well one thing I would definitely do is                                 just show them some of the other                                 websites that are using Drupal I mean                                 Drupal isn't always known for you know                                 being the fastest CMS or you know it's                                 it's not known for those things but in                                 truth like Drupal is very very fast when                                 it's when it has these like                                 performance-enhancing things added to it                                 so I mean some things you could                                 definitely do for that just show them                                 the website it's going to show him you                                 know like the economist com yes New York                                 Times column                                 mmhmm yeah yeah yeahs creo website has                                 has some several great resources where                                 they show you you know some some really                                 large websites that are using Drupal so                                 I mean if they're concerned about                                 performance if they're concerned about                                 you know our websites huge why would we                                 consider using that well I mean there's                                 a speed which which is not really                                 concerned you know in the end you don't                                 have to worry about like security so                                 much because like I said it is the open                                 source you know it's constantly being                                 reviewed by the Security Committee I                                 mean it's it's I don't know like I said                                 it really depends a little bit on what                                 what their criticisms are                                 most definitely yeah yeah drupal can be                                 used for kind of like a mentioned                                 earlier to take take the power of web                                 design out of the hands of the                                 programmers and it lets people who don't                                 know anything about code who don't care                                 to learn code and let them edit their                                 own content let them even move stuff you                                 know drag and drop around the page and                                 put it where they want and if you're                                 using panels or blocks and then like if                                 you use something like workflow or in                                 Drupal                                                                this workflow to control you know at                                 this stage you know there's a content                                 creator role who's creating content and                                 that's all they can see and then it goes                                 up while the editor gets notified when                                 they save the content but it doesn't get                                 published yet until the editor looks at                                 it and puts their stamp of approval and                                 then it gets published and then you                                 might have content curators who are                                 moving stuff around the page and saying                                 oh this should be featured on the front                                 page or you know this should be featured                                 on the top of the news you know story                                 pager or something so it yeah I mean you                                 could do all of those things you could                                 have you know dozens of people and                                 hundreds of people in those roles who                                 know nothing at all about Drupal you                                 know nothing all about HTML or CSS I'm                                 all they do is type in the box and hit                                 go and that's fun yeah and Drupal is                                 great at that too and it's great at                                 controlling you know the process of                                 creating the content and then managing                                 the content and then they don't have to                                 say this will show up on this page you                                 know by using views and whatnot you can                                 kind of have it pulled on to where it                                 needs to go on the website too yeah this                                 is heather from Oak Lea and we do                                 training and you know we were also work                                 on client sites and we get to see some                                 worst practices as well as best                                 practices but I think the thing that's                                 really fundamental and explaining how                                 Drupal works and I think we've talked a                                 little about the UI and and layout is                                 actually understanding the database and                                 even if people don't have any database                                 experience at all they've all worked                                 with excel file so they can I they can                                 kind of understand rows and columns and                                 fields and even if they know a little                                 bit more about                                 cell you know generating you know some                                 type of query that you can you pull up                                 certain types of information and that's                                 what's really so different from Drupal                                 from anything else and it causes a lot                                 of confusion because there's this big                                 middleman in Drupal I always give the                                 example if you are familiar with                                 wordpress template existen the WP query                                 being simply a line where you just say                                 WP query give me a number of posts this                                 is the category and it's right in the                                 markup so even if you didn't know PHP                                 you could just see it and be like oh                                 okay and we and we instead have views                                 and views is incredibly powerful you can                                 do a lot more than you can with                                 WordPress and yet it's I mean up until                                 now it has been more complex and even                                 with the UI improvements I still think                                 its power isn't completely revealed                                 until you go into the Advanced section                                 understand relationships and and                                 contextual filters now so going back to                                 the idea that database again I've seen a                                 situation where a company moved from a                                 wiki system you know a really large                                 company using a wiki really permissive                                 trusting company with all their staff                                 using wiki and it's it was very                                 effective and yet it wasn't able to                                 scale with                                                          moved to a triple but they simply                                 forklifted all that wiki content into                                 unstructured text fields and so now                                 they're still doing the same thing                                 they're actually like they've got an                                 office manager in every office and that                                 information instead of using a user                                 reference for example that's all just                                 edit in a text field so in fact one                                 unstructured text field along with their                                 location information there you know                                 everything that could be piece of                                 information that could be queried                                 somewhere else and so we showed them how                                 to add you know a field so now at least                                 they have a time zone field so that they                                 can actually quickly see what times when                                 something's in and it's they really                                 haven't even realized the the value of                                 this idea of dynamic data and it's kind                                 of like a real missed trick and I think                                 that um we have I think it's really                                 important to just explain that database                                 thing and then all the other stuff comes                                 into place and then that page model                                 problem kind of cliques together like oh                                 right because all that stuff's in the                                 database I need to query that and then                                 make it display in different places                                 because all of the other so many other                                 systems are are so different they're                                 really about the templates and the                                 templating system like WordPress so I                                 don't that helps anybody at all in their                                 work Thank You Heather                                 I think to add on to the your question                                 in the back about like bad experiences                                 with Drupal I I'd also see like I've                                 seen several websites we know we've had                                 from clients are from you know just                                 looking at some websites you can see                                 there are people who have definitely not                                 built Drupal websites kind of the Drupal                                 way there are lots of web star there are                                 lots of companies out there who say they                                 do drupal but they don't really do                                 drupal like you know they might do PHP                                 and you know Drupal provides you with                                 PHP but you know they strip out all of                                 the Drupal stuff that kind of Drupal is                                 great for and so when they're when                                 they're content creators when they're                                 you know the people who are actually                                 using that website they know we have a                                 Drupal website but it's a really really                                 hard to use really horrible Drupal                                 website so if there's some sort of like                                 unresolved you know maybe they need to                                 see a therapist or something you know                                 just to get over those those pains I                                 mean I don't know just did it really                                 comes down to the the person that's                                 creating the website and you know if                                 they do it in a good way that kind of                                 end user experiences vastly improved                                 yeah Barry I'm not gonna rip off that I                                 just had a had a thought there are a lot                                 of questions about your presentation is                                 a lot about sort of the elevator speech                                 approach to casually meeting people talk                                 about Drupal or or blur that a                                 casual person would look at and say okay                                 this is what this is why you do why you                                 do drupal as a as a Drupal shop or a                                 company that does Drupal work we often                                 want to winnow down and be talking to                                 people that have specific agendas where                                 we often are talking to people that have                                 specific agendas so we always want to                                 get down to what are your goals before                                 we get into any of the discussion                                 especially evangelism keeping evangelism                                 out of the picture until you get down to                                 all right here specifically what we're                                 talking about so not everybody has the                                 capability doing this but especially if                                 you if you are doing Drupal all the time                                 and you have a shop and you have access                                 to a community of people whether it's a                                 community of web designers can be                                 of people that are looking for Drupal                                 sites we found that we like to do a                                 general overview of Drupal so that                                 people can get a context before we even                                 get to that discussion so I don't have                                 to do it you know do an hour's worth of                                 contextual discussion with everybody I                                 talked to one on one a lot of people are                                 very interested in Drupal and might come                                 up to you personally but they are also                                 the type of people especially if they're                                 looking to use Drupal or thinking about                                 different systems they would come to a                                 one hour or a two hour thing to hear                                 more about it so that they're informed                                 to ask questions and then you have that                                 discussion and you get a lot further a                                 lot faster so we we did we went to a non                                 drupalcamp went to a nonprofit                                 technology camp and we did up you know                                 Oh what is Drupal or introduction to                                 Drupal overview and it was mobbed and                                 people kept on emailing me in saying                                 when you're doing that again so we                                 started doing it me too started doing at                                 a monthly basis and have people show up                                 you have to do it monthly but if you can                                 do something like that have a semi                                 formal or even informal presentation                                 getting going through some of the things                                 that you talked about what is this                                 Drupal thing what's the difference                                 between this and other platforms and                                 then here's here's why we do it what are                                 your questions then you get to a point                                 where one-on-one conversations are far                                 more fruitful and you weed out not                                 nothing you're trying to weed people out                                 but people that are okay I know enough                                 now to know that Drupal is crap and I'm                                 out of the room then you don't have to                                 get into those uncomfortable situations                                 where you're trying to evangelize to                                 somebody that's never going to hear you                                 and you get into conversations with                                 people that are really interested in                                 talking further further with you so we                                 found that to be extremely helpful as a                                 community practice in our community so                                 if anybody has the ability to do that                                 highly recommend it I know Acquia has                                 the hello Drupal which is kind of sits                                 in this space I think more directed to                                 people that are going to Drupal careers                                 right right exactly and that's that's                                 the space that we're trying to fill                                 we're talking to people that are at                                 companies or more often educational                                 institutions or at nonprofits or I heard                                 about this Drupal thing and people are                                 telling me I need it this designer I                                 talked to said I have to do drupal you                                 know why you know and then we have                                 people that are doing WordPress sites                                 and are frustrated in one sense for                                 certain types of sites that I've heard I                                 should be doing Drupal sites too so                                 that's kind of the space that                                 we're in and the type of people we                                 talked to so I recommend doing that yeah                                 it's we do it it's two it's two hours                                 but well it ends up being two hours                                 because it's extremely open and I answer                                 questions along the way the presentation                                 itself could probably fit in a half an                                 hour                                                                   if I remember right we hit we actually                                 did an introduction to Drupal at                                 drupalcamp Wisconsin or yep yeah and it                                 was a pretty great that was basically                                 chopped completely the part i did with                                 you was completely trapped out of our                                 intro to drupal slides for that session                                 and it went and went over really well at                                 the camp setting too so it's not                                 something you have to just do yourself                                 you can get take it on the road question                                 up in the front here it faced with                                 somebody who wants to develop their site                                 in Ruby just from scratch without any                                 content management system could you kind                                 of give half a dozen kind of key things                                 that are doing it in Drupal what would                                 really improve their life                                 I don't apps a couple of things that                                 would be on their side as well I don't                                 know anything about Ruby but so ever so                                 I guess I need anything when I just                                 build Scratchy well I'm sure that there                                 are people in the audience you know Ruby                                 so I mean maybe you can touch on that I                                 know for one thing when you get the the                                 structure the you know the content                                 structure that Drupal gives you know it                                 it's kinda like you're throwing into the                                 bucket of you know the void of the                                 database but by putting it in these                                 different sections you know the content                                 the content types i'm using the queries                                 or mentioned there you know you can make                                 views that have them display anywhere on                                 your website you know just by entering                                 them in one spot it kind of shows up                                 everywhere and so you get that like self                                 curation you know automatic a promotion                                 feature also i know Drupal is really                                 good at like RSS and posting to multiple                                 websites at once you know so if you if                                 you had like a multi-site setup you                                 could run like several similar sites                                 that are you know kind of running                                 similar content and it shares the                                 database it shares you like those those                                 different avenues and it can it can post                                 them on all those different sites at                                 once without you know having to do it I                                 mean could you pass the mic sorry I when                                 I get asked a question like that I'll                                 know I never I'll never answer it until                                 the my question of back is what are your                                 building and what is it going to do what                                 you needed to do what are the things                                 that you need to be strong about this                                 website what are the who's your audience                                 for the website before I'll get into                                 that question because there are eight                                 billion things about Drupal and you know                                 eight point two billion things about                                 about Ruby just launching into a random                                 these are six points about Drupal often                                 will not hit upon the things that are                                 critical for that project so                                 understanding the you really have to                                 understand the motivation of the person                                 that's asking that question to be able                                 to answer it to give the six things that                                 are that are crucial for that particular                                 situation I think that is that's the one                                 thing that but i always tell web                                  designers that i talked to is never get                                  into the six things we're never get into                                  tching about this is what's great about                                  drupal to you understand where the                                  person that you're talking to is coming                                  from not that you need to have an agenda                                  but just so that you can be specific and                                  and not and just not get flustered by                                  that because they're probably is a                                  really good six points for the thing                                  that you that you do but you'll never                                  know which six points to cover until you                                  understand what the goals of the person                                  asking questions it's very wise very                                  any more questions or discussion topics                                  or anything you guys want to talk about                                  all right well I guess we'll call it a                                  day again I was David Needham for
