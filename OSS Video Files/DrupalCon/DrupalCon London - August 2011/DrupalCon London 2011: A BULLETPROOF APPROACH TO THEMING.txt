Rasmus LÃ¤bel Kalms
Theming is not rocket science, but it can be difficult being a themer on Drupal projects that are larger in scale. Often you find yourself being pulled into projects at an especially unfortunate moment, or maybe you're the lucky one that gets included from the start, but without a clear overview as to what the IA, design or basic functionality looks like.

This session will provide you with the tools that helps you get off the ground fast. I will show you how to develop a strong theme that supports, and promotes an agile workflow within the team, without having to know all the angles. A workflow that brings in the themer from the start, helping the team create a relevant product, where all the best ideas are listened to and included.

Often speed and the ability to react to sudden changes in specifications, or the team itself, is key to reaching any goal, be it specified or otherwise.

With basic tools like CSS pre-processing, HTML5, CSS3 and rapid prototyping, themers has been given a whole new set of options and ways to express themselves. Ways that are both fast and easy to maintain.

I'll take you through the process, teaching you ways to develop a theme that meets the changing specifications during development. A workflow that aids the entire team; developers as well as designers.

content strategy                                and and and all sort of people related                                stuff yeah so yeah and some of our                                biggest clients

enough about me how do we define                                ourselves as steamers and how many here                                defines themselves healthy murs sure I                                have children and how many here are                                developers wow I did not expect that                                okay cool so are there any designers                                present cool and do any of you consider                                yourself as both a developer designer                                and a themer quite a few actually that's                                quite good so um my goals for this talk                                is to give you a set of tools and a                                workflow they can help help decrease the                                amount of time you need to get a                                functional theme up and running um and                                there's not going to be any silver                                bullets I'm not going to presenting this                                magical function sadly I've I've looked                                everywhere in the API and it's nowhere                                to be found and I guess if has some day                                found it it would just be a basic                                implementation of die but anyway so um                                but we we have no such magical function                                but what we do have is it's a set of a                                set of tools and we have a proper                                foundation and is if we make sure to                                have have if we prepare well and and                                make sure that we have the right                                foundation we are going to be setting                                ourself up for for success and                                and we'll be able to reach our goal                                faster mm-hmm does anybody know this                                particular case scenario bad timing and                                then different back-end developer with                                little to no interest in presentation or                                markup I know I've met this developer                                out of my present company of course all                                my colleagues nice guys and they                                understand me but sometimes you'll come                                across this situation you'll be thrown                                into a project at a particular                                unfortunate moment and just little you                                can do about that that's that's not                                something you can influence and but what                                you can influence is stuff like clean                                code foundation and design and you know                                this this situation would be this                                scenario would be okay too if if you had                                the chance to to do at least regular                                code reviews in cooperation with the bag                                interval because you know more often                                than not this bag and developer he has                                interests in presentation and markup he                                cares about the final site and the final                                product he is supposed to deliver we all                                do and we are building the same product                                and the same side and if any part of the                                site suffers or lacks it reflects badly                                on the entire team and so of course he's                                interested in this but it doesn't have                                the time nor should he be focusing on                                these certain issues em but you know the                                fact of the matter is we have modules                                like views and we have modules like                                panels all these modules are                                presentational modules to release some                                extent and and therefore it requires at                                least sometimes that they are being                                configured by a back-end developer and                                if this bag and developer doesn't have                                the time to to dive in the presentation                                or markup the views are probably going                                to be configured apparently and you'll                                have to as a theme or when you enter the                                project you will have to go in and we do                                a lot of these configurations so                                sorry em so how do we deal with these                                scenarios and first let me say this                                scenario still never be ideal for these                                scenarios to be ideal of humor should be                                involved from the beginning and mainly                                because teamers has to know how the                                designer and the front and the back end                                developer requires and I know the                                previous session web systems they touch                                about this a lot as well and it's all                                 about identifying the standard elements                                 and what Drupal requires from the                                 beginning so the basic as a question you                                 should let your theme or ask and you                                 should let them ask the backend                                 developer is does the output match the                                 intended design and this simple question                                 it helps clear a lot of misunderstanding                                 and in the end it doesn't require a lot                                 it require maybe regular meetings one                                 meeting per week or every other or every                                 other day it doesn't require a lot but                                 it's a simple question and again help                                 clear a lot of these misunderstandings                                 and as such you help avoid these                                 constant views configurations and and                                 changes to these and and in the end we                                 all know this how many here uses the                                 module features well and we all know                                 that if if we export of you to these                                 features it's nice and we help ensure                                 some matter of consistency among the                                 development platforms and and and to                                 decide with the prior to but if you have                                 to change let's say just a basic field                                 interview have to remove a label you'll                                 have to you will have to recommit this                                 feature file again and you'll have to                                 commit it and you'll have to revert the                                 components on the site itself and that                                 takes a lot of time easy you'll have ten                                 minutes ago by about this and it's not                                 it's not the best of situations but what                                 we need to do and also what we can focus                                 on SD murs and it's communication and                                 particularly the communication from us                                 to our team members                                 it's both the communication to the                                 backend developer of the developer                                 you're supposed to be receiving code                                 from and the designer you have a unique                                 knowledge of how to bill works what                                 Drupal requires from as as you know as                                 out of the box and and it's it's your                                 job to share this information so how do                                 we improve communication and well and a                                 lot can go wrong when we start these                                 projects and often we work on large                                 sites Drupal is a multi-site platform                                 and as such the sites can grow very                                 large and also the themes can grow very                                 large and there can be a huge amount of                                 modules and that also requires a huge                                 amount of communication between team                                 members and as such every time you have                                 to communicate with a team member there                                 is a slight chance that something might                                 go wrong during this exchange and if we                                 focus on these exchanges we might have a                                 chance to improve the overall                                 communication so basically focus how                                 focus on how you can make a difference                                 from your point of view it's easy to                                  and moan about the situation we're                                 in but ultimately it's our own                                 responsibility to make sure that we can                                 communicate the requirements we work                                 with also if your project manager other                                 any project managers out there my pass                                 is okay and a few others and that's                                 great ensure that's a really simple rule                                 ensure consistent communication and                                 regular meetings with output and code                                 reviews between your bag and developer                                 and and your and your themer                                 so but in as a lot of you are designers                                 and how many here knows about style                                 guides knows what a style guide is cool                                 a lot of you do and in a style guide                                 well if you ask Wikipedia SI guide is                                 basically a style guide a style manual                                 is a set of standards for the writing                                 and design of documents the                                 implementation of a style guide provides                                 uniformity in style and formatting of a                                 document simple and straightforward so                                 basically a style guide is document                                 describing a set of visual standards a                                 static I could be description of logo                                 usage it could be color schemes and how                                 to use colors and it could be typography                                 it could be grits and so on and                                 previously a style guide set has mainly                                 been used for Frank guidelines it has                                 been used to ensure the proper use of                                 company's logo across different                                 platforms and on different kind of media                                 and there's also a valid use for it in                                 Drupal and and for us as steamers and                                 one of the best style guides I've come                                 across during my little research and                                 around the internet is the skype brain                                 style guide and it's it's a great style                                 guide it's it shows very well how to use                                 their illustrations and in their logo                                 and and generally how to communicate in                                 all of their material and sadly I don't                                 have the link i forgot to edit but i'll                                 make sure to add the link under / when i                                 upload them after the decision and so                                 one clear benefit of star gas is that it                                 ensures consistent usage of deliverables                                 and it ensures there's not insurance but                                 it helps clear the amount of                                 misunderstanding that might appear                                 between team members or also for for                                 instance that if let's say your website                                 should be have a module added by an                                 external developer you will have a                                 designer or theme or whatever and you                                 will have a better chance of using what                                 ye yes in front of him                                 so how can we use style guides in a                                 Drupal environment well Prince has this                                 very huge advantage and print has a                                 clearly defined visual canvas and it's                                 an unfair advantage for some at least me                                 yeah and but you know in Drupal we have                                 something similar something similar and                                 and the previous session again mentioned                                 this and it's it's about the content                                 framework that Drupal provides this                                 content framework it's about the                                 presentation of content and as such it                                 provides a clear canvas here to use so                                 the typical workflow with with the style                                 guide and it depends on the website it                                 depends on on how large the website is                                 and as I mentioned most of the website                                 we work on at least in my experience of                                 a fairly large websites and fairly                                 complex where the web sites so that's                                 that justifies a certain amount of                                 detail you put into this start guide and                                 usually before I i start theming i I sit                                 down with a with a with a kickoff                                 meeting with the external designer and                                 often this is external designer but also                                 will if we're lucky enough that we it's                                 one of our in-house designers are if it                                 must if it's myself they already know                                 this stuff but if it's an external                                 designer I find it highly valuable to                                 just sit down and just supply him or her                                 with the list of common items like                                 typography list form elements and so on                                 and when you're sitting in when you're                                 already sitting down with this designer                                 and I suggest you also pinpoint come and                                 design elements like content boxes                                 panels lists and views together and                                 because basically these are these often                                 common elements and they appear on a lot                                 of different pages on the website and as                                 such they could be they could benefit                                 from being included in such a style                                 guide so specifically what should be                                 including is fu yeah typography                                 it's a grid and baseline and it's                                 important that you get a proper grid and                                 baseline defined because you can use it                                 for for instance JavaScript over lace                                 and it can help you and build the                                 website in your browser and it helps                                 ensure the correct usage of Chris and                                 and so on also lists which in our case                                 is views most oftenly also form elements                                 and form elements it can be a complex                                 thing we have a different design                                 patterns we have also complete and stuff                                 like this but it's all elements that we                                 are more likely than more likely than                                 not to to come across when we theme our                                 websites elite at some point point in                                 this size life cycle so we might as well                                 add them as well but also does button                                 use of college color navigation and                                 links and here I'm also talking about                                 tabs and stuff like that images and the                                 usage of images and to external me and                                 teasy lists it's also important that the                                 web's that year the designer defined                                 margins and white space different states                                 I can't tell you how many times I've                                 received a design from a designer and                                 there's a lot of links on the page and                                 that's all very well but we still need                                 the hover states and the focus stays and                                 so on and that goes for the form                                 elements as well of course so there's a                                 general thing you see an example of a                                 typography Paige in the style guide and                                 this is from our own up coming website                                 pads and I say upcoming because we've                                 been working on it for some time where                                 we can't seem to find the right amount                                 of time to finish it well but it's                                 coming I promise and as you see here the                                 headlines are defined we have to find a                                 deck or a teaser field and specific                                 submitted by and catagory text and                                 general body a body styles also another                                 example it's from the great belt website                                 they're basically we build a website for                                 a bridge it is it was actually more                                 complex than you can imagine but that's                                 a different story and here we                                 we we pinpointed a table tables are a                                 common thing in Drupal as well so we                                 might as well pinpoint that and include                                 them in the style guide also paging                                 drop-down and different form elements                                 also messages and you see the taps and                                 the field set that's just some examples                                 but they're all examples I could benefit                                 from being included in such a static I'd                                 also another clear benefit of this is                                 that when when you make sure that you                                 have all these elements receive all                                 these elements from the designer you                                 enable yourself the two to build these                                 sites in the browser own or as you go                                 along and you you decrease the amount or                                 the need for specific page design from                                 the designer and and basically we don't                                 need a specific page design from the                                 designer we don't want that because it                                 constricts us and it if well at least                                 from my point of view it makes my match                                 up boring I hate doing head but if we're                                 supposed to be working like that that                                 that requires a certain amount of                                 information architecture or wire frames                                 at particle and we use information                                 architect we quite extensively actually                                 and a lot of the time we put into a side                                 we we focus a lot on the information                                 architecture and it's an it's a process                                 we have one guy who who mainly works on                                 this and make sure that it gets done but                                 it's a process that involves the entire                                 team and he's sitting there by the way                                 he said he helps ensure that the entire                                 team is is being included and hurt and                                 it's important it's important that you                                 make sure every team member is so                                 because they have each team member have                                 a certain amount of knowledge and                                 experience that they can bring to the to                                 this information architecture or this                                 wire frame and it is important that we                                 include this I'm not going to be talking                                 a lot about information architect your                                 boyfriend's because it's not my area of                                 expertise but I want to just briefly                                 mention it because it's an important                                 aspect of it as well and it doesn't have                                 to be overly complex as you can see this                                 is an oversimplified example of                                 of a wire frame and but just so you get                                 an idea of what I'm talking about here                                 if you make a simple wire frame I supply                                 it with a with a list of output code and                                 with a list of output I mean the list of                                 the different fields in a page and                                 you'll be setting yourself up in a                                 better way and make sure and ensure that                                 you can put all of these pages together                                 in the browser so yeah okay and i miss                                 the slide here if the product project                                 barns that you should keep a list of                                 intended output for each page and again                                 if the is the site is fairly small that                                 might not justify this approach but for                                 the larger sizes i think this is a good                                 idea and because it provides a point of                                 reference for the back end developer so                                 again if you ever in the position where                                 he has to be set up a view and configure                                 view you'll have a central place where                                 you can look up what this view is                                 supposed to look like at the output and                                 it makes those meetings a lot easier so                                 the benefit of all this is the                                 replacement of pitch design photoshop                                 the design of content systems in Drupal                                 and I went out when this process it                                 doesn't necessarily have to take a lot                                 of time and it also clears up a lot of                                 times with the designer because it                                 doesn't have to redesign each page again                                 in Photoshop but when all this is done I                                 tend to a move on to theme and I usually                                 try and build a boilerplate I stand a                                 theme for the entire website and it                                 seems like a no-brainer but often I am i                                 arrived in projects where the theme has                                 already been partly built by the backend                                 developer and as such it's very it's                                 very easy to just slide in there and                                 start theming on top of this a theme oh                                 sorry so it would look like but in                                 reality you're setting yourself up for                                 failure because there's a lot of                                 elements in this theme that you don't                                 know about it there's simply a lot of                                 outcomes that you couldn't have foreseen                                 so disconnect yourself from that theme                                 and make sure you theme a standard                                 drupal theme                                 bystander drupal theme I mean Drupal out                                 of the box it's a fairly simple thing                                 and might seem like common sense but                                 more often than not i come across sites                                 where this hasn't been done and also it                                 is sort of it provides a sort of                                 documentation you'll always have as this                                 theme as a point of reference for the                                 future so remember create stock i keep                                 using and maintaining it and make sure                                 the site has a strong will define                                 information architecture and help                                 maintain it if you're providing a client                                 with the theme for trouble you should                                 make sure it works on even the most                                 basic Drupal installation Sybil I know                                 but                                 also also sorry when you when you use                                 this standard theme build the standard                                 theme it makes it easy for you to build                                 on top of The Bachelor nature nature of                                 triple Drupal is a modular architecture                                 and as such is easier to latch on top of                                 it and and exploit it and as and by                                 modular in nature I mean you know the                                 modules it's sort of like an                                 object-oriented approach but a lot of a                                 lot of sites it builds specific modules                                 for user stories and this user stories                                 are basically it could be a block or                                 whatever but it's still a specific use                                 case and as such you could my might as                                 well hide all your theme files and your                                 template files as an etcetera in this                                 module and it will have this clear                                 benefit that when someday down the line                                 the client doesn't need this blog module                                 anymore they can just turn it off and                                 the co disappears and as such as such                                 you don't have to scour through the                                 entire theme to find old a redundant                                 code and that's a good thing it's a                                 simple thing but still worth remembering                                 so code structure again this is simple                                 but I'm not going to you know do America                                 sorta and starts making your teeming                                 nightmare Merrick had a nice session in                                 at the design camp berlin where he went                                 over a side he had received from i think                                 india or some other country and                                 basically i think it had some of                                 something around                                                   fields and views and whatnot and they                                 were all in the same in the same folder                                 basic in basically in theme folder and                                 yeah it's a bit of a nightmare and it                                 can't be avoided by I you know simple                                 things divided temple templates into                                 folders like muse panels notes etc it's                                 a simple thing but it helps maintain the                                 overview of the entire theme                                 and yes code structure again a touch                                 about this bre briefly but if and I'd                                 like to mention it again but if you if                                 you move a lot of your themes CSS and                                 styling and you use the new naming                                 convention from Drupal                                               naming conventions manage conventions I                                 mean something like system tab paste or                                 CSS if you use them and and and put them                                 in your in your module you going to be                                 doing yourself a huge favor also it                                 makes it easier to override the CSS at                                 another point in time which is a good                                 thing and so yeah um yes I don't know if                                 you've ever felt the same way but but                                 sometimes and um our job gets a bit it                                 gets like a route seen it feels like a                                 job and most of us does this because                                 it's supposed to feel like a hobby we                                 love what we're doing and we love coding                                 like designing and we like likes tea we                                 like teaming and what about a year ago                                 and I certainly am I felt tired about                                 front-end design I felt tired of cutting                                 out images and putting them in my style                                 sheets and everything was just sort of                                 repetitious repetitious and I did it                                 over over again and it was just a                                 routine and I started started feeling                                 like a job but then I attended the                                 conference called future of web design                                 in New York em as a way of kick-starting                                 myself and and there are fairly to talk                                 with a lot of like-minded individuals                                 and then made me realize but instead of                                 being afraid to use things like css                                      html                                                                    basically that's a lot of you actually                                 and I didn't at the time I was I was                                 scared of using it I was scared of what                                 the client might might say I might react                                 to it and but so I went to New York and                                 I just in New York I decided I should go                                 back and you start using it                                 on a client project and this is this is                                 the thing I had to use it on a client                                 project without asking for permission                                 and it was a bit risky i know but such                                 as life and and we went on with it so we                                 started implementing html                                               radius and all these lovely new                                 properties from css                                                     great it was funny and it gave us a new                                 sense of flexible code and it was really                                 it was really great and then the meeting                                 came with with the client and and I                                 dreaded this meeting with the client but                                 what happened what had happened in the                                 meantime was that iOS Android and                                 general mobile usage of their sides it                                 had soared we were talking about it was                                 suddenly something about ten percent and                                 in the past they have always been quite                                 in they have always been reluctant to go                                 this path and start supporting all these                                 new new properties but this new reality                                 they were facing it required some amount                                 of views of css                                                       current the currents I couldn't it with                                 the current side they couldn't play                                 html                                                                    we have just implant implemented html                                  video so we can just look at them and                                 say what we already did that so                                 basically we have are already optimized                                 their side for these new platforms and                                 they were elated they love this and and                                 and as such because of this the                                 conversation never touched upon things                                 like progressive enhancement and all of                                 these technique you can use to to start                                 using these new techniques and the                                 client just accepted it it was just a                                 fact of life so I I recommend that you                                 just jump into it I know it's a bit of a                                 risk just do it just start using it your                                 life will be better for it there's some                                 clear fan of benefits of using css                                      age                                 ml                                                                       and it keeps the code flexible and those                                 less need for cutting out graphics and                                 photoshop cutting our graphics is                                 repetitious and we hate doing it at                                 least I do and and it also makes makes                                 the less the site less flexible also it                                 leaves no room for prototyping and an                                 iterative approach that's that it's not                                 sensible to start prototyping and just                                 build a page as a test or small                                 application in Drupal when you have to                                 cut out i'll do the design from first                                 and cut out all the graphics and all                                 that when you can just start using it in                                 the browser maybe have a a small example                                 of what it could look like and you could                                 start as a theme and start building it                                 in the browser and it keeps it more                                 flexible and it has has a no more it                                 makes it erations more more easy so                                 adaption an ease of use and there's some                                 amount of hurdles and there's a lot of                                 new problems when you start using css                                  and html                                                          prefixes and I don't if you started                                 using css                                                            problem it's a the extensive use of                                 winter prefixes all over your style                                 sheets and very easily your style sheets                                 becomes very messy and and generally                                 they they become yeah it become it                                 becomes hard to gain a complete overview                                 and and that's where CSS preprocessors                                 come in and do any of you know CSS                                 preprocessors I know if Ben touch upon                                 it several times during the conference                                 so okay a few of you too and I've mainly                                 used less myself and and and CSS                                 preprocessors they are mainly an                                 extension to CSS they help provides                                 users with new capabilities like                                 variables and mix-ins for instance                                 functions nesting and so on this                                 an example of a variable and less can                                 receive this is this okay cool and                                 basically you just define a variable and                                 you start using it this is a color rule                                 and divine you use your variable and it                                 instantly inserts the color it's very                                 neat but also this is my favorite                                 mix-ins this is basically you know it's                                 like variables with classes you define                                 your class and your parameters so that                                 you can pass by reference and as such                                 you can start using it in your rules                                 throughout the style sheet but you know                                 either using the class itself and adding                                 that to to to to the rule or the class                                 itself with a new parameter so for                                 instance if you added rounded corners                                 stress                                                                start using                                                              and you can also do this for border                                 radius left and all that sort of thing                                 and it's very neat and it helps avoid                                 clutter and you can em and you can                                 define your rules once and you can start                                 using throughout your style sheets there                                 is a small caveat though you have to                                 include these lesson style sheets on top                                 of every style sheet in your drupal                                 theme and but it's a small import rule                                 and and it's no big deal really and                                 there's also nested rules which I never                                 use it personally and I think the main                                 reason for it other main a justification                                 for its existence is that it makes the                                 this year's s more easily easily                                 readable but I love CSS I love the way                                 CSS looks and and I love to use CSS so                                 for me it doesn't make that much sense                                 but maybe it does for you I don't know                                 there's also functions again I think                                 this is a bit crazy I haven't I've                                 haven't personally had a real use case                                 for it still but some might have it I                                 don't know I've actually can I'm                                 actually considering doing a fork on                                 unless and removing all these                                 capabilities just so and over seal is                                 again developer doesn't start using them                                 in in their CSS files at some point it                                 hasn't happened yet but it's bound to at                                 some time at some point                                 m and n is there a model for this yes                                 and both SAS SAS and I haven't really                                 used SAS but it's it's very similar to                                 less in the way you use it and how you                                 use variables and and it has the same                                 capabilities it has the advantage of                                 being included in the CSS framework                                 called a compass and that's a no                                 vengeance for some but I don't use that                                 so it's relevant also less Hess's neat                                 little module and it's a great little                                 module you just you turn it on and you                                 add the extension that less to all your                                 CSS files and then it's just instantly                                 compiles them and and it just works and                                 it works with the CSS aggregation that's                                 let as well when you compromise your                                 your CSS files which is a neat thing as                                 well um so yeah final note organizing                                 your theme and and and your whole                                 approach to this it goes a long way and                                 and really what it what it all comes                                 down to is just common sense a lot of                                 these these things but if you make sure                                 you're prepared and I build your thing                                 the proper way you're going to reach                                 your goal faster so and also the single                                 and most important thing that you can do                                 is take upon yourself to communicate the                                 constraints and possibilities of Drupal                                 um it can be to the bag and developer                                 you can't be to the designer or whatever                                 but as such instead of just bitching and                                 moaning as a wise guy it's called it you                                 can take it upon yourself to communicate                                 these these constraints and also one of                                 the main reasons a lot of deadlines tend                                 to get to when you don't meet deadlines                                 it's it can be for because of the-- murs                                 and developers who are involved in the                                 project and as such i came across a                                 great quote from the designer and the                                 rutledge he says your designers should                                 be running their own projects do not                                 play some non designer in between them                                 and a client you have responsibilities                                 should share but your designers two are                                 consummate professionalism to do                                 otherwise is to their                                 professional development perhaps                                 permanently I think this this rings true                                 for females as well but developers push                                 them together and let them know they                                 have this responsibility to communicate                                 the constraints and the possibilities of                                 Drupal because the project manager                                 justin has has this at this overview so                                 but also putting to ask the client                                 because it will help gain a certain                                 amount of responsibility and and it's my                                 experience that you work that much                                 harder if you know what's at stake so                                 basically that was it thank you                                 it was a bit short and I was I've been                                 told that the bus is leaving out from                                 out front so you can go out there here                                 at at                                                                cool I've one sir constraints well it's                                 fairly easy starting using html                                          just change the duck type but yeah sort                                 of constraints is actually easier than                                 then it sort of looked like because you                                 you can go all the way in and start use                                 all the html                                                       semantics but it might not make sense                                 for you and you can also just implement                                 html                                                               gracious gradual thing and just do that                                 you go along and but just by T and I'm                                 not kidding just by changing the duct                                 tape you changed a lot of things and so                                 the really were not constraints for us                                 at least there are is the constraints                                 about you know older browsers like I                                 seven and I six and images and                                 specifically gradients we I love the use                                 of CSS gradients but you know it's not                                 really widely adapted yet and so if if                                 you have to cut out these images and you                                 have to implement images you can just do                                 it in the end so we just we just cut out                                 hold it all this nonsense malarkey or                                 whatever British the British guy people                                 call it and stop focusing on it and and                                 that action alone helped me move a lot                                 of these constraints for us at least so                                 anyone else you                                 one more time yeah                                 it's cash its cast yeah and and no                                 that's the great thing about it it just                                 works and there is no drawbacks about it                                 and the only drawback about using less                                 is that you have to include it on each                                 of your CSS files and when I first                                 started using this and I couldn't                                 understand why I didn't work I thought I                                 could just you know have this is this                                 file and it will automatically be                                 included in my info file and it would                                 just work magically but it didn't so                                 that's small constraint small include                                 what and sorry yeah it's about in the                                 whole workflow i define all my border                                 radius and stuff like that I didn't find                                 them in a single file and add them in                                 for example a list folder in my CSS                                 folder and I import them at the top of                                 my CSS files where I'm supposed to be                                 using border radius or the functions or                                 whatever so you just just define them at                                 on the top and it just works so any                                 other                                 oh okay I did not know that so the this                                 he said it's worth noting that less                                 Chris the file separately from yeah it                                 creates a less optimized filing separate                                 area from the other CSS files and yes I                                 hadn't really realized that and so but                                 yeah it's worth noting because it adds                                 to the amount of CSS you have to                                 download on each page                                 yeah so it was not so much a question as                                 a recommendation it's the lady she                                 recommends that we use the less app                                 instead of using the module because if                                 we add a wrong to curate less                                 declaration it breaks the entire side                                 and that's true really and personally                                 for me that that workflow didn't work                                 for me but I know about the less app and                                 it's a great app you can also use it                                 from the command line if i'm not                                 mistaken yeah yeah and that's neat as                                 well and that might fit the developer                                 types in here a bit better than using an                                 app i prefer the app but but yeah thank                                 you anyone else so thank you that's it                                 also a small little thing I've been                                 asked to give a little shout out to the                                 front end United camp in netherlands in
