Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Mark Ferree
When you think about contributing to Drupal your first thought is usually of patching bugs and writing new features.

If you are not a developer, don't worry! There is a huge opportunity to increase your understanding of Drupal, shape the future of the software you work with, and help out the Drupal project along the way.

Learning Drupal can be a difficult and frustrating process. Getting involved in the community is the fastest and most fun way to climb the learning cliff and learn to love using Drupal!

I will describe how your efforts in the following areas can help maintain a healthy ecosystem and promote growth in the project:

Advocacy
Design
Documentation
Project Management
Support
Testing
Translation
If you are already a non-code contributor, please bring your own stories to share!

Drupal for a while                               kind of know how Drupal works how kind                               of know what goat is going on with                               Drupal but haven't become an active part                                of the community kind of had sat on the                                sidelines watch everything else go on

  Drupal and figure out why they're why                                they're passionate and why they get so                                excited about Drupal so a little bit                                about me you can find manager Borg if                                you want to get in touch with me twitter                                is also a great place to get in touch                                with me and as far as work goes I worked                                for a small Drupal company in San                                Francisco we do almost all Drupal                                development besides a few really old                                legacy sites and we do a lot of Drupal                                  sites now we moved pretty much entirely                                to Drupal                                                            modules that kind of thing that's that's                                what we do so the motivation for this                                presentation I've been doing Drupal for                                almost five years now and when i started                                i just showed up at a job one day I said                                I know HTML and CSS and they say do you                                know Drupal and they say and I was I                                don't even know what that means and they                                pointed me to the handbook pages that                                was Drupal five-day Drupal four days                                actually so the handbook was it that was                                my only source of information so I just                                jumped in started reading every page of                                the handbook and tried to teach myself                                Drupal so over the course of five years                                I went from just a person trying to put                                together Drupal sites to a themer and                                now I'm pretty much doing all module                                development so it may seem intimidating                                now but over over time you can learn a                                lot with Drupal and through Drupal so                                learning drupal can be extremely hard                                people used to talk about a learning                                curve and lately they've been talking                                about a learning cliff so getting from                                the point where you first understand                                Drupal first introduced to Drupal the                                point where you can actually do                                something really effective with Drupal                                can be really difficult you know a lot                                like climbing up a big cliff                                but the good part is we have a giant                                community probably one of the biggest                                open source communities that's out there                                and there's a lot of help out there and                                the great part is is you can also be                                part of that help anybody that's just                                one step behind you climbing up that                                cliff one step behind you on that ladder                                you can help that person on on the next                                step and you know help out the rest of                                community along the way and so the                                biggest thing to remember when you're                                working with Drupal when you're working                                within the community is just to stay                                positive it's really easy to get really                                frustrated you saw me slob down in my                                chair and that first slide it's it's a                                frustrating piece of software to work                                with you know it doesn't always work as                                advertised it doesn't always work as you                                intend it so if you can keep a positive                                attitude any time you're interacting                                with other people from the community                                instead of you know going on the attack                                you're always going to get better                                results so some people you know jump in                                immediately saying you wrote this API                                totally wrong in a rewrite it from                                scratch you guys don't know what you're                                doing those Zen guys over there with                                their framework they know what they're                                doing and that's that's not going to get                                you anywhere so stay positive and the                                interactions you have with rest of the                                community and that's because right now                                while we're talking a lot of the core                                contributors are over in a session                                talking about burnout it's easy with all                                the requests are coming and all the                                people are asking you questions to get                                really burned out with your                                 contributions to Drupal but with one                                 positive comment one positive action                                 from a user you know one person offering                                 to help you out might be all it takes to                                 you know push you past that and keep                                 doing effective contributions to Drupal                                 so to get started you're in the best                                 possible place to get started one of the                                 you know initial points for me to get                                 involved with community with drupalcon                                 Boston back in                                                        like this you're going to meet lots of                                 people you're going to find lots of                                 different niches and Drupal that you can                                 contribute to you can find lots of                                 different parts of the community you can                                 meet a lot of people from the community                                 when you're online everybody's just a                                 username and it's easy to dehumanize                                 that and think this person is just a                                 coding robot that codes in their sleep                                 and puts all the stuff together and you                                 come to one of these events and you                                 realize that's just a person that you                                 know doesn't have a lot of free time                                 left but they you know are really                                 passionate about Drupal they love                                 writing code and that's that's what they                                 do the next thing you can do is sign up                                 for a drupal org account I think you had                                 to register for London so you guys are                                 already set there and so I go through                                 the steps on how to do that but you're                                 all set and so then the next step you                                 come to is wait a minute isn't you know                                 Drupal written in PHP and JavaScript and                                 HTML I don't know how to do any of that                                 so where can I get involved you know                                 where can I step in to help people out                                 the vast majority of people that use                                 Drupal are just like that they don't                                 know any of the coding languages they                                 don't know any code at all they just                                 want to piece together a site with all                                 the modules that are out there they come                                 to Drupal because it you know advertises                                 on those pages that can do this it can                                 do that and all you have to do is                                 download it and unpack in a directory                                 and you're done so those people every                                 single person if they've successfully                                 set up a drupal site successfully                                 installed a module successfully done                                 anything with Drupal they can help                                 somebody else out that can't even figure                                 that much out so the area's I'm going to                                 cover our advocacy design documentation                                 project management support testing the                                 translation so those are a lot of things                                 you hear in any sort of software                                 development process and a lot of people                                 take it for granted in the Drupal                                 community when I was just starting now I                                 kind of just figured that stuff just                                 happened on its own nobody spent time on                                 it but a lot of times what happens is                                 the coders that are writing the best                                 features for Drupal the coolest modules                                 working on you know contributing a core                                 are also being their own project                                 managers are also offering support to                                 all the users and that's a you know a                                 burden that other people can take off                                 their shoulders because it's work that                                 you know can easily be done by somebody                                 that doesn't know how to write code                                 so to help advocate for Drupal you can                                 join a group near you there's a lot of                                 local users groups and there's new ones                                 every week every day almost I go to                                 groups drupal.org you can also just go                                 to an outside group you know if you're                                 really passionate about Drupal if you                                 really love Drupal you just go to a PHP                                 group or a JavaScript group and you know                                 a lot of times I think there's a general                                 attitude and outside software community                                 they look at the code behind Drupal it's                                 ten years old it's got a lot of legacy                                 stuff in there and they kind of think                                 you know why would anybody want to use                                 this so it's good for them to hear you                                 know I like using Drupal because it                                 offers me all these features or I like                                 using Drupal because of this so just                                 keeping that you know those words out                                 there you know keeping people excited                                 about Drupal is a good way to kind of                                 change that perception because it's not                                 all about how pristine the code looks on                                 the back end it's also about the                                 experience you get using the software                                 and that's a good way to also introduce                                 new people to Drupal I think a lot of                                 people have heard about it by now you                                 know the very few people that haven't                                 heard about it but you can bring                                 somebody in that maybe wouldn't have                                 tried it out otherwise would have used                                 it competing system so here are some                                 pictures of you know different types of                                 events bottom left is drupalcon San                                 Francisco where you know have almost                                                                                                       been feeling like that in here today I'm                                 sure you guys have felt the crowd and                                 but you can also you know just have six                                 people around a table with beers talking                                 about Drupal so the size of the vent the                                 type of event isn't really it's just up                                 to the organizers and up to you in terms                                 of like how you want to interact with                                 the rest of the community                                 so an area of Drupal that people                                 probably don't know about that needs a                                 lot of help is designed Drupal events                                 like these if you've been noticing the                                 posters the t-shirts the stickers the                                 buttons the logos all over the place                                 somebody probably volunteered their time                                 to design that if you know they weren't                                 working for a company that got                                 contracted to do it and that's a good                                 way for a designer to get their name out                                 there get some good material for their                                 own portfolio so that's a good way for                                 designers to jump in to the Drupal                                 community another place where we need a                                 lot of designer help is their expertise                                 and usability user interface and                                 interaction developers tend to write                                 whatever is quickest and easiest when it                                 comes to an interface and as long as the                                 check boxes are there as long as that                                 menu is there the feature is done in                                 their mind but if the check boxes could                                 be switched for a drop-down menu and it                                 would make it                                                     developer may not think that way may not                                 notice that and so all it takes is a                                 designer coming in with one issue saying                                 can you switch this from a checkbox to                                 drop down menu that developer change is                                 one line of code and it makes the module                                 infinitely easier to use so don't be shy                                 if your designer to speak up on issue                                 cues with specific suggestions about                                 what can be changed sketches wireframes                                 any of that kind of stuff is it mentally                                 helpful for developers that don't know                                 that information themselves and also                                 Drupal if you compare it to WordPress                                 and the number of themes that you see in                                 the theme directory if a designer really                                 wants to make their name stand out they                                 all they got to do is put a decent                                 drupal theme up there and immediately                                 they're going to get job offers from                                    people it's it's finding a good drupal                                 theme or is you know extremely difficult                                 and that's a great way to get your name                                 out there so here's some examples of                                 some of the logos and collateral that                                 people have created so it's also a nice                                 spot you know a lot of times as a                                 designer you're working on client work                                 they're telling you what to do and if                                 you notice the Drupal community isn't                                 going to tell you what you can and can't                                 do you can get pretty creative and crazy                                 with whatever you want to do                                 so it can be a fun thing for designer to                                 design a logo for a drupalcamp or a                                 drupal meetup this is a great place to                                 get involved in usability with Drupal I                                 know the page itself probably isn't very                                 appealing to designer aesthetic but you                                 the Prairie initiative is trying to                                 lower you know barriers to contribution                                 on drupal.org itself so there's a lot of                                 discussions around the usability of the                                 issue queue on drupal.org the usability                                 of the drupal.org at site itself the                                 usability of all those features on there                                 and so it's you know extremely high                                 profile site drupal.org gets a whole lot                                 of traffic so you get an opportunity as                                 a designer you know as a usability                                 expert to work on it a large site and                                 help push forward some of those features                                 there's the theme directory for anybody                                 doesn't know where to find that and all                                 you need to do is you have to go through                                 the same process as a coder but it's                                 much easier to get approved you create                                 your theme you create an issue saying I                                 want to contribute it drew blood org                                 somebody will look through the code make                                 sure you know you don't have javascript                                 bugs in there that are open up cookies                                 or some security issue and you'll                                 probably get approved pretty quickly                                 documentation is another place where                                 anybody this learn drupal knows there's                                 a lot of room for help anybody can jump                                 in if you guys all have your drupal.org                                 accounts so you all can go in right now                                 and edit ninety percent of the                                 documentation on drupal.org yourself all                                 you need to do is head to a                                 documentation page click that edit                                 button that you'll see when you're                                 logged in and immediately you get a note                                 edit form which every Drupal user is                                 painfully familiar with and you can                                 scroll down and start making the changes                                 the only required field is you have to                                 give a log message saying what your                                 motivation was for making the change                                 just so somebody can go through if they                                 didn't like the change that you made                                 they can revert back to a previous                                 version                                 project management is for me when I when                                 I started contributing it took me a long                                 time I use Drupal probably for three                                 years before i even made any effort that                                 contributing anything back and this was                                 probably the most surprising for me once                                 i did start contributing some code to                                 drupal the amount of effort that is                                 involved if you run a reasonably popular                                 contributed module you can get                                      issues a day on your issue queue so                                 project management is needed just to                                 keep track of all those feature requests                                 that are coming in seeing whether it's                                 duplicates seeing where they where                                 there's new problems that are coming up                                 that are actual bugs vs problems that                                 are just problems with documentation                                 that need to be cleared up so if you                                 look on any project just to introduce                                 you to the issue queue a little bit this                                 is where most of the work and Drupal                                 happens both in contributed modules in a                                 Drupal core so there's recent issues as                                 well as an issue search box on every                                 project you go in and you have ways to                                 break down these issues by versions of                                 Drupal as well as you know the component                                 of Drupal and you'll those be sorted by                                 most recent and so if you look this is                                 an example of just some issue I helped                                 out with the user has a pretty simple                                 request you know it's pretty much just a                                 documentation request but the module                                 development developer doesn't have to                                 answer this question anybody that knows                                 how to use the model can go in and                                 answer the question and the vast                                 majority of issues on almost any issue                                 queue are that kind of thing it's                                 anybody that successfully installed the                                 module can probably help out maybe it's                                 a little more complicated but it's a lot                                 of times it's just parsing what it's a                                 pretty complicated explanation and                                 turning it into a decent answer                                 another way you can help people out is                                 just by offering support anybody that                                 was just in the previous question down                                 in the main concert hall there was some                                 talk about the forum's being pretty much                                 abandoned so it's a lot of users helping                                 out each other but that's not                                 necessarily a bad thing because if a                                 developer goes in with an explanation                                 about how to do something in Drupal                                 they're thinking about the code that                                 underlies that feature not that the                                 steps of beginner would take to check                                 the check boxes and make it happen so                                 the forums is a great place to jump in                                 as a new user help answer other people's                                 questions and you'll end up learning a                                 lot just by answering those questions                                 the issue cues like I said in the                                 previous slide just jump in answer a                                 question you know read through other                                 people's questions if you don't know the                                 answer and you can give half an answer                                 that's better than nothing because then                                 the person filing that feels like                                 they're getting a response back and it's                                 not just a black hole where they send                                 their questions IRC is another place                                 where you can get support if you're not                                 familiar with IRC it's a giant chat room                                 where everybody working on Drupal                                 everybody looking for Drupal support                                 they all pile into a couple of different                                 chat rooms and ask each other questions                                 right back and forth rapid fire so if                                 you have something you know I just took                                 down my client site and I have no idea                                 how to fix it kind of issue that you                                 need to get answered right away then IRC                                 is a great place to jump in if you just                                 do a google search for IRC you can find                                 an IRC client client for whatever type                                 of computer you have and on drupal.org                                 the IRC chat rooms for drupal are all                                 listed there and you can also just offer                                 support in real life something we've                                 started up in the local community is we                                 have a user's helping user session where                                 a bunch of people sit up sit around at                                 eight sit around a table and ask each                                 other questions and if nobody knows the                                 answer you can at least point them to                                 the right place to find documentation                                 but a lot of times if you get ten Drupal                                 people together somebody's ran into the                                 same problem before and you can help                                 regular users out and then you just get                                 to socialize a little bit it's a little                                 bit less and personal than some of these                                 other areas                                 this is an example of what you get in                                 the forums just a typical forum but if                                 you look at the number of posts and some                                 of those forums and the number of new                                 posts you can get an idea of how much                                 stuff is pouring through there this is                                 probably the number one place new year's                                 new users to Drupal hit and it's also                                 almost completely ignored by existing                                 Drupal users so as a beginner is a great                                 place to go help people out that aren't                                 going to probably get help otherwise and                                 this shows you on what you get with IRC                                 and you know there's a lot of talk and                                 Drupal contribute you can see there                                 which is where a lot of the core                                 developers hangout is a good place if                                 you're interested in PHP development                                 just to watch what they're talking about                                 see what's going on with Drupal                                       you can learn a lot just by sitting                                 there and reading through it there's                                 also a Drupal support if you see down on                                 the bottom so that's dedicated support                                 channel there's people there that are                                 you know in there just to answer                                 questions and then there's just plain                                 pound Drupal which is just you know kind                                 of a lot of support questions that's                                 probably the one people type in that                                 don't know where any of these channels                                 are don't know which ones are for which                                 and they just end up there by default                                 here's an example of somebody getting                                 support in real life I think this was at                                 a Drupal com a few years back but that's                                 probably the number one way so if you                                 have any way to build a local community                                 if it doesn't exist already or get                                 connected with your local community                                 that'll help you climb that Drupal                                 learning cliff a lot faster than                                 probably any of these other methods                                 testing is a great way to help and it                                 doesn't have to be as complicated as you                                 think it is a lot of times with Drupal                                 you're doing testing for module                                 developers even if you don't know it as                                 soon as you download a module and                                 install it if there's a bug there and                                 you're the first person to find it it's                                 great if you have the ability to quickly                                 and clearly say exactly what happened                                 what went wrong and post that on that                                 modules issue queue because if ten                                 people find that bug and nobody reports                                 it is probably going to go on patch for                                 a really long time explaining yourself                                 well is really the best part one thing I                                 like to encourage new people to do if                                 you haven't tried this already for                                 Drupal                                                                compete complete package where you run a                                 copy of Drupal locally from this aqua                                 site so you can download a complete web                                 server with Drupal inside it this is a                                 great place to test modules because when                                 you install a module in here it removes                                 all the dependencies that you have on                                 your existing site so if you have a                                 large complicated existing site you can                                 bring the module in here by itself and                                 test it by itself so you can you know                                 replicate the issue where somebody else                                 could because module developer isn't                                 going to have access to all of the sub                                 modules and conflicting modules that you                                 have on your site so if you can confirm                                 that the issue happens on a standalone                                 site like Doc we installer then you'll                                 get a better idea of if it's a real                                 issue or not another thing you can do if                                 you're a little bit more advanced or you                                 just you want to get more advanced is                                 learn how to apply patches a lot of                                 times issues will get fixed in an issue                                 queue and somebody will attach a patch                                 to that issue queue for that specific                                 thing and so if you're really frustrated                                 with a module you can't get it working                                 you can't get it working with the code                                 that's there in the package release a                                 lot of times you can find the answer in                                 an issue queue and if you learn how to                                 apply patches with get there I think                                 there's a couple sessions on that here                                 and there's a lot of really good                                 instructions on drupal.org as well that                                 allows you to test out cutting-edge                                 brand new features cutting-edge brand                                 new                                 patches to bugs and really move the                                 development of that module along because                                 if you're a module developer you're                                 working on a bug or you have no real                                 sites to test it on usually you're just                                 testing it on a local copy and so if                                 somebody can download install and test                                 it on a development copy of a real site                                 that can help out a lot another area                                 that is it's completely detached from                                 what you would think of when                                 contributing to Drupal is translating                                 all the content in all of these modules                                 in Drupal core if you go to localize                                 drupal.org there's a whole sub site set                                 up just for contributing back                                 translations of all the strings in every                                 Drupal modules so there's a function                                 called the T function in Drupal and                                 every string and Drupal should be if                                 it's not wrapped in a tee function and                                 that means all those strings are                                 available to be translated into one of                                 these                                                                localized Drupal at org but if you see                                 the number of contributors and also the                                 progress for some of these languages is                                 extremely small so if you speak an                                 obscure language or know somebody that                                 does it's probably a pretty quick and                                 easy task to go in and translate some of                                 these strings and the more of that that                                 gets done then it opens up Drupal to a                                 whole different community of users                                 because they can then download Drupal                                 out download a copy of Drupal download                                 the translation and immediately their                                 copy of Drupal will have all of the                                 buttons all of the text all of the help                                 text translated into their own language                                 so why would you want to go through all                                 this extra work you know spend your                                 spare time working on Drupal spend you                                 know a lot of extra effort you know                                 engaging with the community the first                                 benefit is really a greater                                 understanding of Drupal there's just a                                 lot of parts of Drupal that you're not                                 going to understand unless you dive in                                 and are actually working on them and the                                 next time you have a bug with that area                                 of Drupal you're going to be figuring it                                 out twice as fast as you would have                                 previously the second big benefit is you                                 build a network of people that are going                                 to want to help you out with your own                                 issues so if you jump into somebody's                                 issue queue and start answering a bunch                                 of support requests and then you file                                 your own feature                                 quest for a new feature on that module                                 nine times out of ten that maintainer is                                 going to really take your feature                                 request seriously whereas if you come                                 out of the blue into somebody's feature                                 requests they're going to just click the                                 postpone button and you might not hear                                 anything else about that feature request                                 so it's a good way to build up a network                                 of people that are going to help you out                                 and it makes using Drupal a lot more                                 enjoyable you kind of get up more when                                 you're outside of the community you keep                                 thinking of they they're going to fix                                 that they're going to work on that                                 they're going to get that done and as                                 soon as you jump in and realize that                                 this is all happening with just regular                                 people either in their spare time or at                                 work you realize that it's a more of a                                 week question and it feels a lot more                                 sort of attainable to get your problem                                 fixed or get your problem worked on so                                 everybody needs to grab a shovel because                                 there's a lot of work ahead of us here                                 are a bunch of additional resources i'll                                 post the slides right after this this                                 links off to pretty much all the                                 handbook pages a couple of articles                                 people have written about this some of                                 the some of the information covered in                                 earlier slides and a lot of a lot of                                 this is on drupal.org itself so that's                                 the first place to look if you want to                                 find guides for contributing                                 so that's it that's what I have for my                                 talk if anybody has questions I won't                                 drag you drag it out that much longer                                 ok                                 ok                                 okay that's good                                 yeah that's really good                                 about that                                 so is everyone going to run out and try                                 to jump in it the first few issues the                                 first few patches the first few you know                                 documentation edits are the hardest and                                 then you realize every time you see a                                 you know see something needs to be                                 changed every time you see something                                 that needs to be worked on you just jump                                 in and start doing it and it just                                 becomes second habit so don't don't slow                                 down as soon as you get started just                                 keep plowing through and eventually                                 you'll make a real dent all right thank                                 you thank you for coming
