Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Mark Ferree
When you think about contributing to Drupal your first thought is usually of patching bugs and writing new features.

If you are not a developer, don't worry! There is a huge opportunity to increase your understanding of Drupal, shape the future of the software you work with, and help out the Drupal project along the way.

Learning Drupal can be a difficult and frustrating process. Getting involved in the community is the fastest and most fun way to climb the learning cliff and learn to love using Drupal!

I will describe how your efforts in the following areas can help maintain a healthy ecosystem and promote growth in the project:

Advocacy
Design
Documentation
Project Management
Support
Testing
Translation
If you are already a non-code contributor, please bring your own stories to share!
