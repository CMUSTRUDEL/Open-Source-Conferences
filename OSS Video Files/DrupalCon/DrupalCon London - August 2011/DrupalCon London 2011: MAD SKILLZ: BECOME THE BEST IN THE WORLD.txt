Diana Montalion Dupuis
Are you a themer or developer who wants to work on bigger, more complicated projects? Do you want to send your resume to top Drupal shops and get hired? Do you want to assess and approve your skills?

If so, come to this session and create your plan. You will leave with you a take-home list of essential traitz and skillz. You'll also find out what a few top Drupal shops and in-house Drupal team leaders say are the "Most Important Skillz" their best developers possess.

We'll focus on three essential questions:

1. What specific skillz do I need to build?
2. What kinds of experience should I seek to demonstrate those skillz?
3. What are the essential non-tech skills that matter most?

Team builders and Drupal business or project owners will benefit too. You'll get a master list of skills to use for team development plans, hiring assessments, and ideas for how to assess that "certain something" that the best developers possess.

Intended audience
Drupal development professionals who want to beef up their mad skillz and want a clear, researched answer to the question, "what skills are essential to have in the Drupal talent marketplace"? Team builders who want an outline of what to look for in potential developers.

Questions answered by this session
What technical skills are foundationally necessary for a Drupal themer or developer?

What technical skills are Drupal shops and clients looking for?

What non-technical skills are Drupal shops and clients looking for?

What are some essential traitz of top developers?

What are effective ways to prove my skills?

	                              hi we're going to set best practice                               standard and start on time how unlike me                               usually ok so this session is called mad                               skills become the best in the world and                               I'll open with an apology the                               description on the website is in more                               accurate description of how the session                               came together and the one on the i phone                               or iPad a mobile app is a little bit out                                of date so this might be a little bit                                different than you expected but the gist                                is the same we're going to talk about                                the traits and mad skills that Drupal                                shops and development teams want you to                                have and that developers want to master                                and my name is Diana Montana and dupuy I                                am director of professional services at                                four kitchens I am a back-end developer                                programmer application developer                                software engineer depending on what                                we're calling ourselves this week I also                                don't like beer which makes me unique                                among our team and very much enjoy                                American football which is not the                                soccer version but the football so I'm                                going to ask this question but I already                                know the answer is there anyone here who                                also enjoys American football wow this                                is the most ever I once had almost                                    people in no one raised their hand and                                someone tweeted I love the Drupal                                community no one likes football so my                                tweet and four kitchens so what we're                                going to do we are not going to do                                static because we are developers of                                dynamic websites so we're going to have                                a dynamic your lb involved session and                                we're going to perform queries we're                                going to perform queries on ourselves                                but we're going to perform queries                                and also because I know multitasking is                                a common way to spend sessions I'm also                                going to suggest that we play a Twitter                                game now this might not be as fun as I                                originally imagined it because I've been                                hearing that the internet access is not                                always reliable in this room so let's                                hope it is and if it is I was thinking                                that we could post tweets that have                                absolutely nothing to do with what's                                really happening for example there's an                                elephant running around the room                                whatever kind of outrageous thing you                                might come up with so that people who                                are not in this room have absolutely no                                idea what we're doing in here so if you                                want to play that's the hashtag and also                                the organizers asked me to remind you                                that at the end of this presentation if                                you are getting on the bus to go to                                Batman and I know you all are getting on                                the bus and going to Batman do not pass                                go do not collect                                               straight from here to the buses and I                                think there will be some dogs nipping at                                our heels to get us to go there so what                                are mad skills mad skills are a way of                                organizing what is the meta categories                                for the kinds of skills that Drupal                                developers need to have I have                                   categories that will go through there                                are more this was whittled down and they                                are all debatable the categories                                themselves and certainly the examples                                we're going to use for the categories                                themselves but we are not going to                                debate them here because I know how we                                are because I'm an IRC and so but I                                definitely welcome feedback after the                                presentation and I'll let you know how                                to get in touch with me the mad skills                                are separated into beginner intermediate                                and advanced and like I said we're going                                to be dynamic so we're going to go                                through them in the form of a pop quiz                                it's not really a pop quiz it's actually                                more of a self-assessment experience you                                won't actually have to have memorized                                anything but I think pop quiz sounds                                better so you'll want to organize away                                if you'd like to keep track of your                                score while we're doing this but                                meanwhile let me tell you what my goal                                is in doing this kind of work and                                working as an open source developer has                                been the most rewarding experience of my                                professional career and it's been                                rewarding intellectually creatively                                socially financially and I really want                                 to share those rewards with people who                                 are not yet in this field I personally                                 am especially interested in working with                                 brand new comers with populations of                                 people who don't generally view this as                                 an option and this is the way that I at                                 least at the moment or choosing to give                                 back to the community to bring more                                 people and enable more people to do what                                 we do so I do have a little bit of a                                 soapbox rant to start and that is that                                 in order for Drupal to become the best                                 in the world we the people who implement                                 Drupal must be the best in the world                                 that our work defines our integrity and                                 my strong opinion is that we are a                                 collective of professionals and more and                                 more we are becoming a collection of                                 professionals and that we are only is                                 good for the Internet as the team who                                 implements the solutions so that's                                 another reason that I'm interested in                                 professional development I also have                                 some private goals that I'll only share                                 with you because you came to this                                 presentation as a developer I work with                                 brilliant and talented people who are                                 constantly challenging me to grow and I                                 would like to encourage more brilliant                                 and talented people to                                 join the teams that I work on because                                 that's what leads to the rewards and                                 then as director of professional                                 services at four kitchens I want to                                 build bigger teams teams that continue                                 to be as effective as the fabulous teams                                 have been able to work with so far so                                 that we can take on as a collective we                                 can take on more complicated and                                 interesting projects as Drupal's reach                                 extends and then also as a drupal event                                 attendee because this represents the                                 entirety of my social life so I need to                                 bring more fun and interesting people                                 into the community so that I have more                                 people to hang out with because                                 apparently I'm not going to go find them                                 on my own so and the businesses that                                 implementable they have goals we're                                 going to see a series of quotes today                                 from people who hire Drupal developers                                 and build teams this is the first one                                 from Paul Bateman the technology                                 director for the economist online and my                                 question to people and the answers did                                 not always follow this format but my                                 question was what are the top three                                 traits or skills of either developer                                 that you've worked with n value or what                                 you look for in somebody that you're                                 considering bringing on to the team and                                 Paul said his three things were skill                                 set that the person has the right skills                                 for them to use personality so they fit                                 into the culture and passion wanting to                                 make a positive contribution from the                                 outset and these are the themes that                                 you'll see play again and again and                                 again in what people are looking for in                                 Drupal development                                 so you may have a number of different                                 goals you may want to make major                                 contributions you may want to create                                 innovations integrate drupal into other                                 kinds of technologies web technology                                 specifically you may want to make a most                                 used distribution you may want to become                                 a core committer you may want to own a                                 nice motorcycle or a drupal company or                                 be an independent contractor that                                 everyone is fighting over or provide                                 services to nonprofit organizations or                                 to get a great Drupal job so when I                                 focus the session on the process of                                 hiring and professional development I do                                 not mean to say that that is the highest                                 priority goal that developers should                                 have but just to pick it out of a list                                 of things to talk about in fact to                                 professional development and developing                                 skills will help with all of these goals                                 so the one last definition is what do I                                 mean the best when I see a the best in                                 the world I don't mean better than                                 everybody else that's what I call the                                 geek disease some of you may be a little                                 bit familiar with it you'll see in the                                 feedback that people give this is one of                                 the things that we're we're trying to                                 avoid by using the word the best in the                                 world what I mean is a valued and                                 valuable member of a talented team and                                 value is exactly what I'm trying to say                                 so in typical geek fashion I'm going to                                 ask you a question but I'm only asking                                 you so that i can tell you what I think                                 but we're going to go through the                                 motions anyway what would you say is the                                 most essential skill PHP in my sequel                                 skills html                                                             of Drupal hooks lamp stack systems                                 administration can set up a performant                                 architecture community involvement                                 certainly a contender or something else                                 something out yes I would say that the                                 most important skill are good person                                 skills and excuse me when a new person                                 walks in the door the thing that I care                                 about most is how is it going to be to                                 work with you that we're going to spend                                                                                                       together and if you are I've chosen to                                 represent this as an interesting                                 character string if you are difficult                                 and say then I don't want to work with                                 you and pretty safe to say that would be                                 a universal feeling but conversely if                                 we're in huddled together trying to find                                 a bug in a third-party API that isn't                                 quite working and we need to get it                                 working for the demo tomorrow and I'm                                 having fun then I want to work with you                                 and so does everybody else and certainly                                 so does our clients so to give a better                                 description of this than I can this is a                                 quote from Greg Mattison who was the                                 owner of growing ventures solutions up                                 until recently and he is now director of                                 security services at aquia and he says                                 if you are hiring for the short term you                                 need someone who has work skills                                 building content types views knows                                 modules if you are hiring for the long                                 term you need someone who has life                                 skills resourceful positive attitude                                 enjoys learning in all cases                                 communication skills and personality are                                 important I follow the three hour rule                                 or if I'm                                 stuck in an airport for three hours with                                 this person will that be exciting                                 indifferent or a problem it has to be                                 exciting or at least on the high end of                                 indifferent so we got together the team                                 at four kitchens we got together to try                                 and define good person skills we found                                 this very hard to do this is the list                                 that we came up with but still don't                                 feel like the words are exactly quite                                 right but certainly communication skills                                 would be on the top of the list that we                                 as a group of consultant developers as a                                 high communication high-touch kind of                                 work which i think it is in general the                                 communication about the solution is I                                 would say the most important factor in                                 the success of the solution itself and                                 also because we're talking about joining                                 a team teamwork skills and the being                                 able to work with other people in a way                                 that is productive and fun and last was                                 cultural fit cultural fit is the                                 trickiest one to to define one thing                                 that we know is curiosity and passion                                 would be two essential elements to a                                 good cultural fit and the other is take                                 responsibility and ownership very much                                 it's a culture of my this is my                                 reputation my work is on the line as                                 part of this team the way I describe it                                 is that if the team succeeds the team                                 succeeds if the team fails I fail and                                 you know take your share of the credit                                 and all of the blame and as a culture                                 this works very well because in the end                                 it matters to absolutely everyone that                                 things are done well and then this one                                 is the cool person and one of the                                 developers suggested which i think is so                                 is that every organization tries to come                                 up with what that means and Google calls                                 it googly so we call it web Chevy                                 one of the similar to how Greg talked                                 about it here we are drupalcon London                                 it's the evening we're going to go out                                 and have a beer and talk about code                                 stuff with other people is you are you                                 someone I want to drink a beer with in a                                 foreign country is that going to be fun                                 and then unselfish which I think just                                 makes logical sense that if the focus is                                 very much on the individual then that                                 takes the focus away from the collective                                 and the problem being solved but I think                                 that both cool person and unselfish just                                 means not interesting character string                                 and like I said the same things come up                                 again and again so this is Matt Cheney                                 who's the managing partner at chapter                                   and he said I think the best developers                                 are the ones who believe in the projects                                 they work on passion can substitute for                                 a lot of experience and if a developer                                 cares about their work they will almost                                 always do much better than those who                                 don't care even if they happen to be a                                 technically stronger developer so there                                 are many many many routes to                                 professional development and I hope to                                 put together a whole nother session that                                 just talks about resource options for                                 the different kinds of skills so in this                                 case I'm going to talk about very high                                 level lessons learned along this road                                 about getting mad skills and the first                                 is to become an expert in what you love                                 if you do what you love you'll love what                                 you do not everybody or excuse me not                                 anybody will have expert level skills in                                 all the different categories there might                                 be a few but I don't know if I want to                                 know that there is and then brand                                 yourself according to your strengths                                 that teams don't expect you to know                                 everything they they expect to be able                                 to coordinate strengths in order to                                 accomplish the task that needs to get                                 comp get accomplished so if you're very                                 clear about what you love and what your                                 strengths are it makes it a lot easier                                 to apply those strengths to                                 problems do the minimum of what you hate                                 because if you do what you hate you'll                                 hate what you do and then create                                 alliances to compensate for weaker                                 skills so for example working on my own                                 I am NOT a designer and I am very very                                 much not a designer so it was very                                 important to me in order to meet the                                 needs of clients it was very important                                 to me to have good relationships with                                 people who are and within teams even                                 though we do try to always be raising                                 each other's skill level which is part                                 of the agile process that that we are                                 very devoted to still some people will                                 have strengths and some people have                                 weaknesses and we organize around those                                 develop skills you either like or need                                 even if you're not particularly excited                                 about learning a skill if you actually                                 have to apply it to solve a problem that                                 you have it'll be more enjoyable to                                 learn than it would be if it was just a                                 random next on a curriculum and                                 constantly develop the skills you don't                                 have I don't think there's anyone in                                 this room who needs for me to to say                                 that I know that a foundation of this                                 work is certainly to be constantly                                 learning and never be the smartest                                 person in the room and this goes back to                                 the Charlie Sheen the Charlie Sheen                                 image of if you are the smartest person                                 in the room you're probably in the wrong                                 room you've probably outgrown that                                 particular situation and that your                                 skills will grow far faster if you're                                 surrounded with people who have the                                 various skills that you're working on                                 okay so here are the list of mad skills                                 HTML are sorry categories i should say                                 HTML CSS javascript PHP databases excuse                                 me DevOps systems

promised you in the beginning we'll have                                 a pop quiz how mad are your skills and                                 again really self assessment experience                                 the more new agey way of putting it each                                 category urns up to three points and you                                 earn the number of points that represent                                 your highest level in each category so                                 for example                                                            that category there will certainly be                                 some of those plus                                                       for intermediate plus                                                   the instructions are very very                                 straightforward track your score use                                 text pad of paper and pen your fingers                                 and toes and it's as simple as that are                                 you ready to begin okay good person                                 skills you get up to ten points if you                                 are a good communicator so if you are                                 truly truly brilliant at communicating                                 about technical issues as they arise                                 your attend if you absolutely never want                                 to speak to another person for the rest                                 of your life then that would be a zero                                 most of us are somewhere in between up                                 to                                                                   team member I think that follows the                                 same scheme up to                                                       cool person and seeing as you're all                                 here I think you're on all and automatic                                                                                                          are an interesting character string                                 so now we're going to move into the                                 categories you can score one two or                                 three points there's no way to score six                                 you're either a one or a two or three so                                 HTML plus one if you're aware of markup                                 language and how it's used you're able                                 to view source and you can understand                                 table is layout and let me add these are                                 general examples if you have the sense                                 that you fit into one category even                                 though you might know something                                 different from another categories not                                 exactly what you know that's totally                                 fine this is a self-assessment                                 experience therefore you have plenty of                                 latitude plus two if you write valid                                 markup by hand you understand cross                                 browser testing and compatibility and                                 you use debugging tools so if you have                                 Firebug installed you're automatically +                                                                                                       awareness you know specific rendering                                 differences if you have had to use them                                 for ie                                                                 that's more of a CSS issue isn't it                                 familiar with emerging technologies                                 html                                                                   HTML is CSS plus one if you know how CSS                                 effects style of pages across the site                                 and you understand what cascading means                                 in this context this is not for a                                 beginner an easy concept to understand                                 plus to you write valid cross-browser                                 compatible CSS files by hand so that you                                 can open text pad and write CSS and you                                 use debugging tools so this is if you                                 have Firebug installed and you use it                                 regularly plus three if you understand                                 css                                                                    emerging technologies and you understand                                 performance and caching as it relates to                                 the front-end rendering of a page                                 javascript which is my negative ten                                 subject plus one if you know what its                                 purpose is and that it's not java and it                                 wasn't even meant to be funny that this                                 is a very common misconception                                 among people who are not yet familiar                                 with with JavaScript plus two if you can                                 traverse the Dom you can use at least                                 one library and can hook into events                                 plus three if you're familiar with                                 emerging technologies harmony for                                 example if you're active in the                                 JavaScript community and or you're able                                 to implement web sockets which is an                                 attempt at an example of doing advanced                                 things with JavaScript so if there's a                                 something to substitute for web sockets                                 feel free PHP plus one if you understand                                 that it runs on a server and is a                                 programming language in other words you                                 can describe the difference between                                 dynamic and Static plus two if you                                 understand basic programming functions                                 so variables arrays functions if-else                                 statements you can read code and edit it                                 so if you look at a piece of code you                                 have the general sense of what's going                                 on and you're able to make changes in                                 how it functions you can perform single                                 line database queries so select and                                 insert fine if you're don't do                                 complicated joins or sub queries and                                 that you understand what object-oriented                                 is enough to be able to make use of                                 classes and objects and plus three if                                 you write classes if you write them from                                 scratch so if you're able to just open                                 up and start creating your own class and                                 the harnesses to run them if you apply                                 the Big O which is attempts to write                                 code that runs as quickly as possible as                                 appropriate and if your code is elegant                                 and if you know elegant code from in                                 elegant code then that would be a plus                                 three                                 databases plus one if you can create                                 databases and users using the GUI tools                                 so in other words you can open up PHP                                 myadmin and you're able to create a                                 database and users as part of the                                 process for example of installing Drupal                                 plus two if you can execute queries                                 create tables right semi complex queries                                 with maybe one join or one sub query or                                 using the my sequel functions and plus                                 three if you can tweak indexes architect                                 performance optimizations write complex                                 queries with multiple joins and you can                                 make sure that those queries are                                 performant and run as quickly as they as                                 they should and you have experience                                 beyond my sequel so if you have worked                                 with other databases especially the                                 newer technologies that would put you at                                 the three level okay                                 DevOps or development operations this is                                 all related to workflow so plus one if                                 you can use a version control system for                                 basic tasks which I would highly                                 recommend always all the time and you                                 have a separate dev environment from the                                 live environment so you're not editing                                 the live environment as you're building                                 it plus two if you use version control                                 on a team project so therefore you are                                 able to integrate it with other people                                 working on the same code at the same                                 time as you are if you set up a                                 development to stage to live environment                                 and by setup I don't necessarily mean                                 the the systems architecture that has to                                 happen as much as the workflow itself                                 and also you follow a quality assurance                                 process so code reviews for example some                                 way of checking things on stage before                                 they're released into into live and that                                 that's a consistent part of the work and                                 number three is you use feature                                 branching automated deployment or                                 automated testing so now once you get                                 into the three level you are using                                 applications to do the work for you so                                 hand in hand with this goes with systems                                 administration and when in developing                                 this list different teams organized to                                 come up with a list and we tried to mix                                 and match so that you did have people                                 without the skills in a certain area so                                 that they could speak for beginners                                 because one of the things we found is if                                 you ask a PHP developer what are                                 beginning PHP skills they come up with a                                 very different thing than somebody who's                                 learning PHP so we tried to coordinate                                 them and the interesting thing to me was                                 for systems administration and                                 performance and scalability the                                 developers most skilled in those areas                                 were also the most verbose we had to go                                 through two or three passes to cut back                                 on the skills that they were suggesting                                 which was a surprise because in general                                 they are not the most verbose developers                                 that that I work with but when you ask                                 about this they have lots of great                                 things to say so +                                                   Linux package managers in                                 add and remove packages configure                                 repositories perform common command-line                                 tasks configure components on the lamp                                 stack excuse me of the lamp stack                                 plus two if you know the purpose of each                                 folder in a standard POSIX system can                                 inspect and configure network devices                                 and firewalls create backup strategies                                 basic security and if you can set up a                                 new server or an instance in the cloud                                 and we had a bit of a discussion about                                 whether it's Posey ixora POSIX anyone                                 went away in on that POSIX like Pau yeah                                 yeah                                 you get a point if in general your                                 skills match that list of skills yeah so                                 if you're missing one I want or you know                                 or you have one that's not listed there                                 it would be really impossible to come up                                 with well now I'm actually kind of                                 motivated to do it but I think it's kind                                 of impossible to come up with a                                 definitive list yeah okay and plus                                       your excuse me you're able to implement                                 automatic configuration and deployment                                 tools such as VCF g                                                   have advanced security knowledge you can                                 use penetration testing tools or set up                                 intrusion detecting tools performance                                 and scalability plus                                                  clusters of servers can be load balanced                                 so you understand load balancing and you                                 understand the limitations of and can                                 work with replicated databases plus                                      you write code that employs chest enough                                 caching you're able to profile a site to                                 discover where the bottlenecks are and i                                 have no varnish and memcache i would say                                 that you're able to to configure those                                 so that they're working on the site and                                 plus                                                                     system profiling tools such as SAR Oh                                 profile if you can design a scalable                                 architecture and predict problems if                                 you're knowledgeable about cutting-edge                                 technologies such as no sequel databases                                 excuse me MongoDB Cassandra                                 okay so the next group of skills are                                 related to specifically about Drupal                                 development so before we move into that                                 will do in take a web chick break and                                 again you're going to see how how the                                 same kind of themes arise again and                                 again so Angie when asked the question                                 about the three traits she came up with                                 first taking initiative it takes minimal                                 energy to complain about something you                                 don't like and a lot more to actually do                                 something about it this guy Jay Thorson                                 for example he got stuck in the project                                 application Q he'll like all new code                                 contributors do and the normal reaction                                 is to whine about the situation on IRC                                 instead he started reviewing other                                 people's applications to try and prevent                                 others from being frustrated and then                                 went even further to start churning out                                 patches for test spot so it can do                                 automated coding standard checks to take                                 the burden off of project application                                 reviewers people who do stuff like that                                 get my immediate thumbs-up and this is                                 what we were what we had listed as                                 responsibility and ownership very much                                 the same so number two civility and                                 respect its natural in an open source                                 community for many people to have many                                 heated passionate opinions about various                                 things it's also natural that we won't                                 always agree when I see people wade into                                 these kinds of heated discussions and do                                 things like summarize the arguments to                                 date with objective neutral language and                                 state their opinions in a way that                                 values the opinions of others it puts a                                 huge plus one in their corner for me the                                 inverse is also true regardless of                                 technical skill level I can't ever                                 justify recommending someone who walks                                 into a discussion with a chip on their                                 shoulder and knowingly treats other                                 people with disrespect interesting                                 character strengths                                 and number three was a willingness to                                 spread knowledge around so people who                                 contribute to documentation people who                                 help out and support channels people who                                 help others one-on-one at local meetups                                 etc those people are solid gold in my                                 book this directly helps foster the                                 community of mentorship that is the                                 heart and soul of what makes Drupal                                 great and what I find interesting is                                 when asked this question from people who                                 have been working as part of Drupal                                 development teams with some of the most                                 brilliant developers in the world they                                 come back to things that aren't                                 necessarily directly skill related in                                 other words i mean the skills are very                                 important can't do our job without the                                 skills but it is other things that I                                 think make those skills truly come alive                                 ok so Drupal site building plus one if                                 you can create users content types                                 fields create roles and permissions                                 create blocks administratively set up                                 the basic and we might say normal                                 features of Drupal through the admin                                 interface plus two if you can install                                 Drupal add modules and themes in the                                 right folder and create views and use                                 panels and it doesn't have to be panels                                 specifically but a module that greatly                                 impacts how the site functions and                                 you're comfortable being able to to                                 adjust and play with them and integrate                                 them into the core Drupal site plus                                 three if you use features which does not                                 make everyone happy there are certainly                                 people who don't enjoy features so you                                 either use features or have a                                 well-thought-out argument about why                                 features is not something you want to                                 use you apply rules both for actions and                                 layouts you can implement complicated                                 module integration or complicated views                                 and then dribble development by this I                                 mean specifically custom module                                 development or module development so                                 plus one if you can apply a patch                                 understand hooks and can read module                                 code plus two if you can use the form                                 API hook menu and database API and plus                                 three if you can write custom modules                                 using Drupal best practices that's a                                 very important part of that sentence                                 right custom drush commands or cron                                 tasks and write performance enhanced                                 code so adding slow code and not sorry                                 really having the skills to be able to                                 understand how to implement a special                                 especially the query heavy tasks i think                                 is an essential skill for back-end                                 development drupal theme building plus                                 one if you install a drupal theme                                 customized settings via the UI modified                                 templates make cosmetic changes to                                 Drupal's default output plus two if you                                 can use a base theme or subscene you can                                 create custom templates you can apply                                 advanced front-end concepts like                                 accessibility and responsive layouts so                                 this is you can start with a sub-theme                                 and end with the look and feel of the                                 site that you want and then plus three                                 is you create a theme from scratch you                                 use the template PHP to its fullest by                                 using or creating theme hooks to                                 modified ripples output or you can add                                 theme functions to the module so this is                                 where you begin to change the                                 functionality of Drupal itself in order                                 to get what you want to use in the theme                                 and then you're able to use it in the                                 theme layer okay so visual design this                                 is where I desperately needed the                                 designers to                                 guided me through these skill levels so                                 plus one design software use knowledge                                 so in other words I'm told knowing                                 Photoshop is not enough you need to know                                 two or three of the usual design                                 applications right from the very                                 beginning no visual hierarchy of                                 elements and design and have designed                                 static websites so one of the things                                 that they talked about was to have some                                 experience in a web page and                                 understanding how those visual elements                                 are different from other kinds of design                                 plus                                                                  and style guides design documents are                                 organized and clearly labeled and you've                                 done design for dynamic websites like a                                 CMS and plus three if you have a library                                 of design tools and styles that are used                                 to rapidly excuse me create elements you                                 can transform your own artwork into                                 markup of following the platform                                 specific conventions and you design                                 states and interactive elements                                 information architecture the information                                 architecture actually is very                                 straightforward plus one if you                                 understand inflammation architecture is                                 the foundation of a site so you                                 understand the importance of organizing                                 all of the pages and content at the                                 outset of the project because it will                                 influence every aspect of the project                                 laying the foundation and then the two                                 points is building the framework from                                 that foundation so you use personas and                                 goals of the site to clearly illustrate                                 the relationship of the pages to provide                                 workflow diaphragm diagrams and logical                                 site navigation so now you've used the                                 foundational information in order to                                 build a framework that the site will                                 will be draped around and then the third                                 plus three is the whole house so                                 understands how aspect of aspects of                                 information architecture and navigation                                 can be translated into specific                                 technology in Drupal and experience                                 implementing modules to aid in this                                 process so in this sense you think of                                 the website as a system                                 that is run by the architecture that's                                 designed in the first place and user                                 experience plus one if you know the                                 difference between a sitemap and                                 wireframes and you can build basic                                 wireframes plus two if you build user                                 flow process of user flow process flow                                 diagrams and detailed wireframes that                                 illustrate the interaction patterns if                                 you're aware of recent trends and AXA                                 build accessibility that's always a                                 tricky word accessibility guidelines and                                 you consider major aspects of                                 accessibility so things like visual and                                 hearing a payment the higher level kinds                                 of accessibility issues that all sites                                 will want to take into consideration and                                 then plus three if you perform user                                 testing of all levels if you have an                                 expert knowledge of accessibility                                 regulations and guidelines so you really                                 know what the rules are and that you                                 consider many levels of accessibility                                 not just the higher levels of a visual                                 impairment but things that are a little                                 less often considered like color                                 blindness when designing a site and last                                 but certainly not least maybe we should                                 have put this one first open source                                 involvement so everyone is here                                 therefore everyone is at least plus one                                 attend local meetups use the issue queue                                 and edit document pages plus two is you                                 volunteer at events you help on IRC you                                 contribute patches small modules or                                 themes you propose sessions and you                                 helping out in the issue queue actually                                 should have gone in this one and plus                                 three is you organized ripple events you                                 become a community leader so in some                                 fashion you take on the responsibility                                 to build and work with the team to                                 implement a solution you maintain major                                 modules Forks or distributions or you                                 contribute to core                                 okay so how did you do give you a chance                                 to add up if anyone needs that                                 so I used not particularly complicated                                 math to come up with these numbers so i                                 wouldn't take them too seriously but it                                 does give you the sense of how from the                                 lowest to the highest they might they                                 might fall into beginner intermediate                                 and advanced totals so beginner would be                                 negative                                                                                                                                          mad skills whatsoever                                                                                                                        mind this is just for fun like a Cosmo                                 quiz you know what a Cosmo quiz is on                                 the it's a woman's magazine and the                                 states and they always have the most                                 ridiculous self assessment quizzes like                                 what does your lipstick tell you about                                 your person your lipstick color tell you                                 about your personality those kinds of                                 things so they're not meant to be taken                                 to too seriously so again a last quote                                 to reinforce how the original skills                                 what we were calling good person skills                                 integrate with the with the mad skills                                 this was from Matt Westgate the lullaby                                 co-founder and president and he said I                                 look for great writing skills                                 communication skills and a self-effacing                                 quick-witted character if they have                                 these things they'll be fun to work with                                 add to the company culture and be                                 teachable and teacher a bull with our                                 clients and teens then I look for wicked                                 ninja development skills                                 so further info I posted the list of                                 these mad skills that Erin stylish made                                 visually attractive I had the text                                 document and then he sent me back the                                 PDF and it's always a maid designers are                                 just like magicians to me it's amazing                                 how they make things look good so it's

                             again I'll remind you about the going to                                 see Batman and going straight to Batman                                 from here because they
