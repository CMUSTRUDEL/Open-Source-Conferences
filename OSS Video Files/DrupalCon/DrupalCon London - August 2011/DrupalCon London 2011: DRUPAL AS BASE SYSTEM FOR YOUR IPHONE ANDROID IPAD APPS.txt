Well no need to explain why mobile apps are important! At present you can't really ignore the iOS and Android platforms. Both these technologies have great potential to use our existing web based tools such as Drupal. You can totally use Drupal to manage your iPhone/Android native apps data in cloud.

A sequel to DrupalCon Chicago's and DrupalCon CPH's "Developing Apps for iPhone/iPad/Android using Drupal as Base System" session (more advanced!! more fun!!)

What will be covered

An introduction to Titanium Framework to develop iPhone/Android apps using Titanium API, web technologies like javascript etc
Introduction to ServicesAPI and web standards [json,xmlrpc]
How to manage your application's data (content, tables, views, users, menus, taxonomy etc) using Drupal.
We will build a live app ... introduce you to some code here (ServicesAPI, YQL, jQuery and Titanium API)
Photo gallery apps, Video uploading, Geo apps, user data apps, creating nodes on the go!
Demo of some apps we built for Android and iPhone platforms
Questions!
This session is about building native iPhone/iPad/Android applications using opensource web based technologies (http://www.appcelerator.com) with Drupal as base system to manage content, users, views, permissions etc.

Some iPhone/Drupal stuff I wrote in past: http://civicactions.com/blog/sumit

Intended audience
Beginner, iPhone iPad Android app developers, Coders, Curious

based system                               we're going to talk about mobile apps                               and why'd you use Drupal in the behind                               it and how to manage data and other                               things so all right                               we go ahead my name is summit I'm a                               freelancer as well as a private                                contractor with civic actions I've been                                doing Drupal for like four years now                                building a lot of mobile apps using                                Drupal as a base system apart from the                                website I've done and you can contact me                                so with koh samet k dot net and so it k                                everywhere by the way IRC twitter                                anywhere you like me to and let's URL to                                my blog like to know more so why we are                                here today we want to vibe i we are we                                want to build for mobile so that's like                                everybody likes app we just loved them                                like my meal my location my what I'm                                looking what products I'm using we just                                want to share everything using our cell                                phones we we just don't want to wait to                                get home get a picture to upload it to                                to my computer and share it with my                                friend if you just want to do it right                                away so but that reason we want to use                                apps and we want to build them so and                                their numbers which which says speaks                                for themselves like more than                                twenty-five percent of the US market is                                using iOS now including ipad iphone and                                an ipad and then the story six percent                                of the market is using android devices                                which runs on more than                                                 days and like the other player is like a                                raymond blackberry which are silently                                but they are coming lower and lower day                                by day so there are like a couple of                                reasons couple of strong reasons to                                think about your mobile strategy and how                                to build apps what to use how to do it                                and how to achieve your goals so so is                                mobile development really expensive or                                is it like so i don't know so yes it is                                expensive like if you think about it you                                are building a base system behind it                                like for example you build it drupal                                website you know how customized system                                you're trying to build there so if you                                are trying to build a mobile app you are                                building a whole system behind it to                                support it support data support                                configuration support all the users                                content economies and geolocation                                maybe so and after that then you get                                into mobile development side which is                                like iOS using objective-c or Android                                using Java those those two are like                                beasts again you need to learn it                                there's a learning curve and then                                there's like long development times and                                that that gets you to like little more                                is like the type that makes you a little                                worried but to what to do how to proceed                                in that direction so what we do like                                when we when we when you try to figure                                out something simpler we look for tools                                that's what we did that's like XP CD and                                somebody's trying to use desert too so                                yeah so which we'd look for tools in the                                market but what kind of tools that we                                can use to build these kind of apps                                easily fast in a cost-effective way and                                which can do out of the box everything                                that we like them too but there are so                                many out there in the market like there                                are so many tools which one to choose                                they are there so many big ones out                                there as well like titanium is a bigger                                one and then there are a couple of                                webkit based tools around and then                                they're there more but like we we choose                                titanium as as like it's a clear winner                                tongue in my view it's like really                                effective you get native apps and it's                                totally works with like a Drupal as a                                base system that you try to do in your                                perhaps and yeah it totally works out of                                the box and its really great and I'm                                going to explain that later on in my in                                my penetration and accept that like its                                Enterprise supported already have so                                many bigger and prize and corporations                                are using it they NBCUniversal just                                launched their iPad app with it which                                which plays so many videos and a lot of                                 content is there you it's a free app you                                 should you should if you want to see                                 it's like what you can do with titanium                                 you you should you should totally want                                 to download that NBC universal app and                                 see how it could be used in your                                 projects it plays videos there are so                                 many sharing app sharing things in it                                 and then you can browse shows and other                                 content from from there                                 web-based system so so the question is                                 like what is this what is titanium or up                                 straighter so titanium is like it's it's                                 a free first of all it's the free                                 framework which allows you to build                                 applications for for phones and for your                                 tablet for desktop and and you use like                                 almost like ninety percent of the same                                 code base for everything like even for                                 desktop or or anything else and so this                                 is a free open source framework that you                                 use to build applications and the major                                 part which is a good thing is like you                                 don't have to learn any new skills                                 you're just using javascript HTML CSS                                 your existing web development skills                                 that you that you already know so so it                                 uses them to write your applications and                                 you get your application out very soon                                 very quickly low development time amount                                 of code is very small compared to                                 objective c or java code and you get                                 native apps that send advantage and it's                                 open source so did you say like apache                                                                                                          drupal we are the true pecan and we know                                 we will we all love open source and so                                 that's the best part around titanium so                                 what what else it has like it had a                                 modular approach to add new                                 functionality to to your existing                                 framework it's open source so you can                                 fork it down so you can customize it                                 according to your needs or your                                 corporations needs and then there are                                 lots of a available API is office box                                 like social networking with api and yql                                 api and so many others so which which                                 are like available out of the box you                                 you can use them to build apps and then                                 it supports iphone and android out of                                 the box and blackberry is still in beta                                 and it's it's there for developers not                                 for other people at the moment but it's                                 pretty stable too and the best part is                                 like it's low development time which                                 which reduces the cost of product and                                 reduces everything around it so it's the                                 best part and it's scalable and you want                                 to build it funds and then you want to                                 scale it to another level two                                 level level it's totally possible you                                 are maintaining just one code base for                                 everything so that makes it that                                 powerful so the question by your hair                                 why do you use Drupal to manage all the                                 mobile applications data well you know                                 Drupal and it's the out of box perfect                                 system for this drupal can manage all                                 your data and content it can it can                                 manage all your sessions and cookies and                                 user registrations user login                                 authentication information in a secure                                 way and you can do very customized                                 things in very easily using Drupal like                                 search or creating views like extracting                                 data writing queries using views and a                                 lot of things that you can think of like                                 user relationships managing friends                                 managing followers and comments geo                                 location based things so so there is                                 like it's very powerful system that's                                 why we choose Drupal at the back end and                                 the part is like it reduces the cost of                                 project a lot if it's the same as you're                                 trying to build something from scratch                                 using HTML or PHP and then build a                                 system on it or you want to use a CMS                                 system behind your application which is                                 like so much capable of doing a lot of                                 stuff that you want to build so everyone                                 is bored big ones are bored first so                                 what what else we need we need to get                                 into the get into this stuff and how to                                 how to use Drupal basically to manage                                 your data in mobile apps and well but                                 what are the what are the things that                                 you can do with it I'm going to explain                                 that later in the slides and so first of                                 all like drupal has a services API which                                 is the perfect thing for for it to make                                 it which makes it perfect to use it as a                                 platform for mobile apps so services API                                 is like it's it's a more it's a module                                 it's its hair since triple five which is                                 very stable it's a branch like its seed                                 or tax right now it's available for                                 drupal five Drupal                                                    well supported what it do is it                                 makes drupal to act as a web service or                                 API so it gives you the end point where                                 you can make your request and get data                                 out of it in there using rest server or                                 JSON server or whatever you like to                                 let's talk more about that later so                                 basically services API is consisting of                                 three tanks three major layers question                                 is services services is like what you                                 want to do with your Drupal website how                                 you want to get data out for example I                                 want to get extract a user information                                 out using user get so that is the                                 service user get and if I want to                                 extract out an views data am views get                                 is another service in similar way we                                 have servers server sounds like how                                 you're making requests to services API                                 in Drupal so for example you want like                                 request xmlrpc format and get xml RPC                                 back so that's xml RPC server rack we                                 have and similarly Jason and rest                                 servers are coming along add a                                 dedication layer which comes in between                                 the server and over requests like it it                                 makes sure you are authenticated you are                                 authenticated to make the request to the                                 drupal's based system and yeah which                                 which makes it more secure and fun and                                 more about like titanium architecture                                 how we're going to build our stuff is                                 like we're going to write a record in                                 JavaScript CSS or HTML on the top layer                                 and then we're gonna then titanium is                                 going to take it and like it's going to                                 compile it to Objective C or Java or and                                 run it on iOS or Android devices                                 separately so we are writing once and                                 but we are using the same code to do                                 multiple things for iOS and Android in                                 this case you're showing and similarly                                 for desktop and blackberry desktop has                                 like little bit different API and ways                                 to do stuff but they are black bear is                                 almost similar oh so more getting more                                 into that like features of titanium and                                 what what it is like it provides you                                 like a native UI functionality you can                                 write a native UI code in JavaScript and                                 was it a nap then it's like it got very                                 rich media API which enables you to do                                 like video streaming and video recording                                 and photo clicking and using the gallery                                 part of the app and things like that and                                 recording audio or stuff like that and                                 then there's like very powerful location                                 API you can you can get the location of                                 a inside the app and you can save it or                                 use it whenever you like to then the                                 remote and local data is something oh                                 very efficient like you can save the                                 applications data in local database in a                                 sequel light weight and remote data is                                 like you can you can make xhr calls to                                 do when our service you want it to be it                                 could be Drupal it could be any other                                 XML or any other Jason service you want                                 to fetch data from it also has like some                                 other features like analytics and stuff                                 if you like if you're interested you can                                 choose them and never convince those                                 then it provides social api's which is                                 like really exciting it gets you                                 functionality for sharing on Facebook                                 Twitter out of the box you can just use                                 the basic API to share we were stuff                                 like you dress for your app on facebook                                 and you get the Heidi's app IDs and have                                 secret you use them in the app and you                                 can share stuff on facebook when                                 whatever user is doing similarly for                                 Twitter but it's like more a little bit                                 complex you need to look in hook into                                 the earth adapters and odd sha-                                        more Street you're sharing so how how                                 this all fits into into Drupal and cover                                 app and how to do stuffs up so what                                 happens is like a Drupal is going to                                 manage all our data users and all the                                 information that we want to use in our                                 app and then we build a titanium apps                                 like in JavaScript and are the others                                 web technologies and then we compile                                 them for our iPad iPhone or Android and                                 then we we fetch the data from Drupal                                 directly into our apps so this is                                 something                                 next I want to give you like little                                 examples how how what we can do and how                                 stuff we can use Drupal into it for                                 example like if if I'm if there is a                                 closed system i want to just user who                                 have login to my website and we can will                                 systems like replies rot me which is a                                  is a closed website which it                                 enables you to watch videos and drupal                                 tutorials but you need to login for so                                 there's a website which if you haven't                                 login for it you can get in but you get                                 into the app and you can watch video so                                 he tenta kate's you to your drupal                                 website and gets you back there with                                 authentication session ID and then you                                 can make other cause using your app so                                 similarly if you similarly it's the                                 views listing like it's fetching a view                                 out from my drupal site and building a                                 table on the app you're going to                                 download these later on in the in the                                 presentation so these are like the basic                                 things that you can do like whatever you                                 can think of a drupal website you can do                                 it on mobile apps then you can add new                                 create new nodes on on triple based                                 system and save all the user content                                 there whatever they like to say for                                 example in this case we are showing a                                 form which enables you to add new                                 workout on it's a gym jay map which                                 which user can create work out and then                                 they can post their work the workout                                 sessions on to it so these are all nodes                                 and lot of user references and no                                 references and they're all handled by                                 app you just send the data back by no                                 dot save it saves it on your drupal site                                 all the data is save over there and                                 you've got very complex data structure                                 handling very easily using group of its                                 it's like and then there's like this for                                 the other example is like you can if you                                 have an app you want users to just                                 download it and register account so in                                 this way like you are just creating a                                 new account it will save all the user                                 information data and then you get into                                 the apt you do stuff and you have an                                 accountant drupal based website and you                                 are using your app for example you you                                 might have used instagram app or some                                 other examples which which enables you                                 to create account and then do stuff like                                 upload photos and we cover get into                                 examples later on                                 with milk em too after that like they're                                 like you can do searches like searches                                 could be very having everywhere so you                                 can like use search service on services                                 API and you use node service or Apache                                 Solr service to search content there and                                 it will just fit out there all the                                 readers and feel a table for you then                                 you can play these videos or look into                                 the details whatever you like and the                                 other thing is like node node display                                 the content display or you can fetch                                 more data more pictures and stuff like                                 that kind of video and taxonomy terms                                 around it and you can display it on in                                 the app after that like you can you can                                 build listings directly using views and                                 taxonomies so for example I have like                                    texts army terms I want to act those as                                 my brows section of my application I'm                                 just fetching a view from my site                                 listing it over there that I'm clicking                                 on one of the category it is fetching                                 another view making tea ideas as a call                                 and it's fetching me the data for that                                 taxonomy ID and so so like it's using                                 your basic views of and basic drupal                                 knowledge that you use everyday site                                 building to build mobile apps and after                                 that if you're getting like a complex                                 data structure you you can do like you                                 can maintain user Cruz using flag module                                 and similarly you can use like a                                 relationships module and they're good                                 services around relationships build                                 already in hundra palette argh you can                                 use them to like mark people follow them                                 make them friends follow their content                                 so this all this stuff is possible like                                 a social networking thing that you want                                 to build is possible from from Drupal                                 based system and you don't have to write                                 any anything in on the on the web and or                                 on the configuration and because all the                                 things are already there just using them                                 wire services exposing them wire                                 services                                 after that you get ipad apps out of the                                 box everybody loves the ipad apps you                                 maintain the same database the same                                 codebase sorry same code base for iphone                                 and ipad you can build universal apps                                 which will work on iphone as well as                                 iPads and you just do like a little bit                                 of configuration like sizes and stuff to                                 manage each of them and maybe an UI                                 little bit and then you get out of the                                 box ipad apps with the same code base                                 that's most importantly it's justice                                 playing more of the ipad app and how we                                 are building listing and stuff and in                                 the background there is the image                                 showing its its debugged data that we                                 are getting from ipad app so alright a

 here I'm not sure how far is going to                                 get me there let me get on this wired                                 internet                                 you                                 okay it's pretty fast I guess                                 alright let's launch it one more time so                                 as you can see behind it it's called                                 titanium studio which you will be using                                 to develop apps in titanium it helps you                                 write code compile it and execute it on                                 simulator as well as real devices and                                 here i am just launching might replies                                 taught me app on my

let's move to next time I guess if it's                                 not going to work                                 last time                                 and the background you can see he's like                                 all the all the debugger is running and                                 you can see all the errors coming the                                 request we are making whatever data we                                 want to send to logging you can set it                                 here you can see it in the console ok                                 the other app I want to demo is it's                                 called meal cam it's using Drupal                                        very simple a photo uploading app which                                 enables you to like click a photo on                                 your mobile phone and attach a couple of                                 information with it like title and                                 description maybe in this case and just                                 upload it just uploads it to your drupal                                 based website under your account and you                                 can browse all those photos there or on                                 your mobile app and you can even email                                 those photos directly to your friends or                                 maybe other things that you like to do                                 that requires internet too                                 all                                 oh and I can't hear you properly                                 probably need to make their so okay can                                 you see this app I don't know why this                                 is running like this it should be so                                 this is a meal cam app you can upload                                 photos and stuff using it it's it's                                 actually it's showing very weird                                 it's going to run like this in this                                 resolution so what you can do you can                                 select the photo or you can click a                                 photo from the gallery and you can see                                 I'm going to select a photo from my                                 gallery and I'm going to upload this one                                 let me say it my presentation back and                                 just maybe a caption other was good then                                 you can say I add it to my collection                                 it's going to upload it back to my                                 triple based system and it's showing me                                 here that I this is the details of my                                 photo that i just uploaded and then i'm                                 going to go here i'm going to show you                                 on on the drupal                                                        for this ok come on we are screwed                                 without internet here ok but the photo                                 got uploaded somehow see here here we                                 have or the photo that we just uploaded                                 and this is the data that we sent to him                                 a trooper based system so it is all                                 authenticated you create an account on                                 the go and then you are login with that                                 account you use your authentic advice                                 session ID to a map app to your drupal                                 based website and then you send picture                                 and it applauds it and attach it to a                                 node and you can browse all these                                 pictures here whatever you have uploaded                                 in past and you can go in details and                                 stuff so this is like a very simple                                 example but what you can do like we are                                 also adding locations to it like                                 displaying photos on maps inside the app                                 fetching geo locations from from Drupal                                 and maybe other sources and yeah and                                 maybe searching geolocation geolocation                                 but what are what's going on around me                                 using Drupal using a location module                                 which is very powerful ok ok the next                                 step I'm going to demo is like it's                                 called trod and let's hope internet                                 works for that                                 any questions so far it is not a Goshen                                 in case pathol Mike yes we do yeah you

year yeah and you know the best                                 part is it's a very very active                                 community you you always find open                                 source version of tau those modules so                                 for example urban airship presence is                                 present in a TI plus module set but it's                                 there are so many other alternatives out                                 there which other people have proposed                                 and you can use any of those if you like                                 it's always it's a no it's like drupal                                 you have many ways to solve a problem                                 I                                 for user interfaces like there is no a                                 UI builder drag-and-drop you you need to                                 write code which is like just JavaScript                                 it's race with me i coded text mate and                                 compile it in this stuff and we type                                 with Android device I always use device                                 I never use emulator because emulator is                                 so heavy if you are developing in Java                                 or titanium doesn't matter emulators                                 with Android is like very hard to work                                 with so yeah whoo it's stuck again I                                 don't know what's going on with Internet                                 I'm sorry guys                                 yes android is like little slower than                                 iOS that's true and performance wise iOS                                 and iPads are much better than android                                 phones if you want to have a feel of the                                 apps like if you want to just drive one                                 of those you have installed on my                                 devices for iPhone iPad and Android if                                 you want to just try them out you can                                 you can look at them in Android it's not                                 terribly slow but it's slow it's not as                                 good as iphone that's for sure all right                                 any other questions because we are not                                 getting internet here to anybody else                                 has that a small                                                    connect as a wife a Wi-Fi router or                                 something I'm not sure Eclipse like they                                 do develop the titanium studio is it was                                 its build upon Eclipse actually yeah                                 yes you can you have sickle aight                                 database access and then you can                                 maintain offline database then you can                                 build actually the sync functionality or                                 whenever you have you get online you can                                 send data back and forth well yeah I                                 don't think that's going to work for                                 very large applications but for small                                 application that's okay where the data                                 structure is like a real small but with                                 like big nodes and big user of friends                                 is big no references it's like building                                 the whole group inside your local local                                 app I don't think like there are like                                 any visual limitations to me it's you                                 can it's not like WebKit which gives you                                 just                                                                   that you can't go on it's going to work                                 so if you just don't drop your was work                                 uh-huh you got a                                                       lets me Wallace drop down                                 he's gonna take a bottle which money                                 looks like perform it's not listed ha                                 gross I find my way ok                                 thank you                                 still connecting any other cushion so                                 far yes                                 yeah I was yeah I will show you a couple                                 of examples like the basic idea is like                                 you use services to do everything in                                 Drupal your services API for example i'm                                 going to show a couple of the calls that                                 we can do using services TX the call                                 thing is the correct hero for example i                                 have my API endpoint at API this is                                 Drupal                                                                 for example I want to fetch the photos                                 from a view inside on my on my titanium                                 a mobile app                                 call to all right no problem and views                                 name of the view and then go to use the                                 J rest api making view named jason so it                                 tells me that i want result in Jason and                                 then I'm going to pass arguments like r                                  is I'm passing as one which is for user                                 ID                                                                       then offset value as well as to which so                                 it is going to return me data of a view                                 let me show you how it works in a                                 browser if my internet is working again                                 no it's not                                 I guess you've been to many                                 presentations where demos were screwed                                 up by internet so so yes a call like                                 this will get you data from from from a                                 view similarly you can do with user                                 objects you want user objects so you do                                 API / user                                                             data for my user one object and then if                                 you want to update a note similarly all                                 are it's similar to rest api that you                                 you're going to make calls xhr calls                                 using your titanium apr                                                 system you create nodes by node and then                                 send this title body information it just                                 creates no one in your turns back a node                                 ID and no data                                 are you need titanium you need the basic                                 app setup and then you just use the xhr                                 on the Drupal site you need to install                                 services API module and that's pretty                                 much it that you just need a new                                 services service the link to module is                                 project / services that's that's what                                 you need to install that's it it enables                                 you to like your act as Drupal                                 installation as a web service yes and                                 you have access to different API so                                 regarding on your membership if you have                                 like the community membership you have                                 access to the basic API is if you have                                 to pro membership you have access to the                                 pro AP is what happens if you change                                 your membership where your old apps                                 still work even though you don't have                                 the pro membership anymore according i                                 don't i'm not position to answer that                                 question and that could be a little                                 complex but i don't think if you if you                                 are not signed to a contract you can use                                 that in your applications that's that                                 makes sense actually because like if you                                 if your contract is not valid then                                 you're definitely working the contract                                 but like you it's not that expensive                                 your are you talking about titanium much                                 less valio the apps are rated plus                                 modules yeah yeah yeah you need to have                                 like you need to have an active                                 subscription to be to be following those                                 room because I was wondering if I ever                                 decide to get into really native iphone                                 programming will I be still be able to                                 use my old apps or will my old apps not                                 work anymore if I ever cancel they will                                 work you you have the code and                                 everything it's not a binary that you're                                 getting you're getting the code so they                                 will be working but you are not you're                                 not using that like legally that's the                                 only thing okay                                 I don't think the I'm not not that                                 familiar with that you can did they                                 change it every day they are just like                                 in in process of building their company                                 as well as all this kind of enterprise                                 yeah it's like whole the product is open                                 source only the TI plus modules that you                                 talk about like the VR barcode scanner                                 and like those credit card scanner                                 modules day they sell those things ok we                                 have a working internet now it's great                                 excuse excuse me yes and did you compare                                 titanium to fun gap before choosing in                                 titanium because it's fully free fun gap                                 in comparison yes phonegap is free but                                 it is a webkit based titanium is it's                                 like it's like native Native is fast                                 native is like you're you use a native                                 app you use a web browser you know the                                 difference so native is definitely fast                                 you get all the native API is it's                                 faster loading time it's faster using it                                 and you get more done with it like it                                 gets you like it restricts you somewhere                                 the phonegap won't give you access to                                 whole device whole device things it gave                                 to everywhere whatever you like ok let's                                 try to apprise me I'm hoping it

                              this and so this is like a multimedia                                 like using the media API as we are                                 playing video using xhr API we are                                 fetching stuff from groupon website all                                 the data is on our Drupal site and you                                 are just using it on a mobile app                                 that's you have to have a Mac this is                                 our iOS sim simulator it's it's Xcode                                 there is nothing clear any other                                 questions internets is quite slow guys                                 as far as I understand the application                                 logic especially by the front and                                 parties JavaScript as you said right oh                                 yes may your see a little bit of that to                                 see how it looks like and how you                                 program it yeah sure yeah just trying to                                 ok here it played the video finally for                                 us so this is running on a titanium                                 titanium API affecting video from cloud                                 front service using Drupal and yeah so                                 yeah I'm just like I will answer your                                 question in a minute I'll just run it                                 down with this first so so here we are                                 actually do a lot of things but whatever                                 we can with Drupal so I can search here                                 for example I wanna surf like if there                                 is a video about Twitter on my replies                                 drop me website it's going to make a                                 call to node search on my on my website                                 and going to fetch me all the videos and                                 you can view details and wash them then                                 similarly the queue which I told you                                 about it's fetching a view for my using                                 flags module so if i created a cube                                 using flags its feting with that view                                 here i am displaying data and the user                                 information is again user information                                 and you can under browse more browse                                 section we have lists of taxonomies the                                 kind of videos that you're going to have                                 on the on this app so then we are using                                 a views to get into or like when you                                 click on it it will fetch all the site                                 building videos using views excuse me so                                 yeah so this is like a kind of things                                 that you can build and you are using                                 media API to stream and two to play                                 videos and stuff                                 I'm going to show this Todd stuff which                                 is like see you in this app unit we are                                 busy saving a lot of node content on the                                 on the web based system it's just doing                                 a lot of stuff complex stuff in the                                 background                                 Oh                                 any other questions in the meantime I'm                                 just trying to make it work yes you can                                 you can you can access everything that                                 you like in the milk and we had the                                 accessing address book option you can                                 select the contact from there it gets                                 you the information in the contact                                 yeah oh you so for that i will i will                                 tell you to go to download NBC universal                                 app it's it's for ipad and they are                                 doing very nice UI and configuration                                 things in there it's like very complex                                 app that will give you like the things                                 that you can actually build with it so                                 this is another thing that we build this                                 is a titanium based using drupal as                                 based system you have classes and then                                 under classes you can this is a gym app                                 so jim has classes for each day so it                                 gives you a list of class then you can                                 select the students who are doing                                 attending a class and then you can see                                 workouts for them on a drupal based                                 system so that they can go back and see                                 their workouts their law of workouts and                                 stuff then you're going to select the                                 work out for them let me actually rotate                                 it to left so you can see rest of the                                 app so i can see there is one workout                                 for this class this is another node that                                 it just pulled from a drupal site and i                                 can see now the work out details it's                                 like type of workout description these                                 are all different cck things that we                                 have then then we can have like a start                                 timer and like do like use the native                                 functionality of of device as much as                                 possible so here i can like start timer                                 and then record there's there's things                                 on the go so i can use these type touch                                 functionality to save data or maybe if                                 i'm more interested i can add more                                 details to it and i can mark them are                                 xed and then when i press a sash add                                 session result it's going to create a                                 couple of nodes back on my on my drupal                                 based system and saving all all of them                                 they're so so yeah and it just added and                                 like if you if you want to see them                                 those results you can go to leaderboard                                 and you can view them how what we just                                 posted you can see like under this class                                 this was the workout and who who did                                 this workout and what what were their                                 records you can view them so oh                                 everything is Drupal in here they lock a                                 lot of node relationships user                                 relationships all handled by drupal we                                 are not doing it we are just using use                                 to expose all of your data                                 / app so yeah                                 so about your question like where how to                                 write that kind of JavaScript pencil I                                 think I can show you some of it so for                                 example like if I want to add a like a                                 row and like a table view oh I'm just                                 defining the stuff like avatar avatar                                 this is not a perfect example to show                                 that let me get into you i underscore                                 styles okay so for example like for the                                 buttons i have defined styles in                                 javascript layers like background image                                 a background selected image and height                                 where color the font the type title on                                 the top and the font weight but we want                                 to be and the form maybe the font name                                 in some cases so similarly you can you                                 can define these like all the CSS                                 properties works here almost almost                                 almost all of them and then there's like                                 you can do things like shadows and stuff                                 and the amazing part is like you can                                 also do like very cool animations in the                                 app screens and so you can they are all                                 native in it and if they are very fast                                 and cushions around it                                 mm-hmm okay so that is something if you                                 were more interested you can read on my                                 blog I'm going to blog more about it but                                 yeah that is something like complex so                                 how user authentication works it's                                 similar to drupal but in mobile case you                                 need a session ID to authenticate back                                 to the site so first what you do is that                                 you make a sec system dot connect                                 request which returns you back an                                 anonymous session ID then you use the                                 session ID to make a request for user                                 login service using that session ID and                                 you send username and password it                                 authenticates you and it sent you the                                 user object then when you see it's a                                 fine user object you you verify roles                                 and everything else then you give them                                 access on the app these are like three                                 steps that you have to do while creating                                 account it's the same you do a system                                 dot connect you get an hour session ID                                 then you make a call for user dot add                                 and you pass the email username password                                 and other other variables and it sends                                 you back a user ID which is just created                                 alright                                 Oh free                                 so like bridging is like it's just                                 making an xhr call I can show you the                                 code but I was just trying to show you                                 like what what how the endpoints work in                                 Drupal services API so for example this                                 is my services in Drupal                                             have an API as my endpoint and I'm                                 making a call to milk am NOT photos dot                                 Jason so it should actually get me back                                 all the folds which user one has                                 uploaded to be the limit of                                             is not working okay it work so it return                                 me the Jason for that for that request                                 and I'm going to use this Jason to fill                                 table on my or maybe any other view on                                 my on my app and going to display data                                 or there so you can see it returns me                                 all the node objects what I requested                                 field of me land and it's uri in public                                 direct from files directory title and                                 other content so                                 this is a field view I guess yeah I'm                                 just calling for like title and a body                                 and image part of it I'm not sure yet                                 but yeah it's almost this but yeah                                 there's like a lot of information on                                 services module page you can learn more                                 about services there there are a couple                                 of tools listed which will help you to                                 to to make like test request to services                                  API and like see what is coming back and                                  how to send it up in there and I'm going                                  to show you how the ex charcol works has                                  the sky requested here here so for                                  example for user get we have like user                                  get service you you use a couple of                                  variables like timestamp nons URL then                                  build out a hash out of it using a                                  sha-                                                                      to authenticate your your app to to the                                  service and then Drupal get you access                                  and then you send the data here exit out                                  or send inside of this you you send your                                  JSON string and then you get the code                                  then you get the values back and onload                                  function which is yeah so that's how it                                  works no it's not not necessary you can                                  use its fine but like yeah you like you                                  we would like to use Jason because it's                                  very light it's it stripped down very                                  less data is flowing over the network                                  the best palate and you know the JSON                                  like a titanium supports Jason out of                                  the box they got like these functions in                                  belts Jason dot string key fire Jason                                  dot C realized soul so you can use them                                  out of the box inside the app yes                                  is there police report built in as well                                  as for Jason Healy's poverty least I                                  don't know that hyper formats be no                                  really Billy's support yeah oh no I                                  don't think I've seen this that in you                                  can write your own module if you like                                  Billy's support but why would you like                                  to write a plist if if you support us                                  and like I always prefer Jason our penis                                  because venerians quite light and I                                  speery server for Drupal which works                                  quite well yeah like it's like it's the                                  same support for free list or or Jason                                  it's supported both ways I know these                                  services yeah but I don't think it's                                  supposed to be this at the moment thanks                                  if you call and Dave on a Drupal site                                  and you've got enough where you got to a                                  client meeting and you can't get                                  internet connection and you've got some                                  dip on the application installed and a                                  secret like database which has being                                  copied from the Drupal site it's very                                  tool that allows you to synchronize the                                  data but stored on your thought with the                                  Drupal site so that when you go back                                  into the office probably be important                                  information it or not it just sends it                                  straight to Drupal yeah you can you can                                  write your own own caching layer for                                  that but you do like you save everything                                  inside the database local database eq                                  light and then you build a sync                                  functionality so whenever you get online                                  you can enable that sync thing it will                                  it's same as you do in Evernote or a                                  wonder list app like you you save all                                  the data and then you sync it to your                                  servers on the back and that everything                                  got to get to the server and when the                                  sink is done you can you can maybe                                  delete that a local database or whatever                                  you like to do with it you can mark it                                  like think it is module or any tools and                                  software or very written to allow you to                                  do that without having rightness                                  synchronization to you are you asking is                                  it supported out of the box is anything                                  available you know but we can download                                  so we don't have to write back uh no not                                  at the moment I never reasonably cash in                                  there for it but there are I know the                                  titanium people are working on a caching                                  there which is going to be supported                                  very soon so they are also working on                                  like                                  they're in a nap cashing so you can cast                                  off and then you can sink back whenever                                  the net can network is online again                                  choose                                  any other last minute questions                                  just one thing is someone a favor anyone                                  wants
