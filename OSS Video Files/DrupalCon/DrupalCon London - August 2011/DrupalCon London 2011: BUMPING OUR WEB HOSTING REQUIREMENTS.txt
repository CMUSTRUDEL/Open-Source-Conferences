Title: DrupalCon London 2011: BUMPING OUR WEB HOSTING REQUIREMENTS
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Problem: 
Drupal currently caters to $5 shared hosting and exotic custom hosting like Examiner.com, Economist.com, etc. This massive range makes software design difficult. It also prevents us from focusing on a target audience.

Proposed solution: 
Drupal should focus on the audience it serves best. IMO, thats mid range and high end web sites. With that focus, we can design cleaner software and avoid some prolonged fights in the issue queue. Perhaps we can even stop the defections from core development (e.g. Development Seed).

Here are some possible increases in our software requirements:

- Shell access to your server is required.
- Drush is required
- APC or other opcode cache is assumed present

	                              all right I think we can get started hi                               everyone my name's mosh Weitzman I'm a                               longtime drupal developer and consultant                               and member of aquia I want to talk a                               little bit about our web hosting                               requirements and perhaps make a larger                               conversation about what is drupal's                               target audience hopefully everyone's not                               too fatigued by now about that question                                I'm feeling a little bit fatigued about                                it but this is a group conversation this                                is the only slide in the presentation we                                can do this and and you know everyone                                could talk so I think most people can                                agree that Drupal has an extremely wide                                target audience from a hosting                                perspective we definitely cater to                                people who are on five-dollar web                                hosting you know the cheapest PHP web                                hosting that's out there where you hire                                you know very highly paid consultants to                                set up multiple levels of caching and                                servers and cdns and multiple of                                everything and it's really quite an                                amazing range there and so that's great                                except for all of the negative effects                                what one of the things that happens in                                that case is that the core development                                team has a really hard time managing all                                of these different audiences and so you                                end up having burnout in the in the core                                development team we've also heard a lot                                about burnout in the last couple weeks                                and here i can think of an issue in                                drupal                                                                 top developer Barry jaspin came in                                worked hard on it and went away maybe                                he'll come back but but he's gone and                                that's a huge loss for a core                                development team                                the one I'm thinking of is in Drupal                                  you are not allowed to delete text                                formats you're not allowed to delete                                text formats that have any content                                that's affiliated with them and the                                reason being that it's really hard to                                find all that content and delete it in                                the context of a web request even with                                our batch API and so the solution to                                this long painful issue was well people                                just can't delete the stuff and we don't                                even have a way to tell you how to go                                about deleting all this content so that                                you can delete your text format so if                                you create it it's there forever another                                all right so what would it look like to                                pump bar web hosting requirements there                                are three things that I put in the                                session description some people haven't                                seen it so I'll just repeat them let's                                say that shell access is required in                                order to effectively run Drupal so you                                need to be able to ssh to your site well                                that lets us take advantage of dress                                scripts to manage your site so deleting                                a text format now becomes fairly trivial                                thing because we're not subject to time                                outs we can go ahead and do it and you                                know there are lots of other things this                                would solve there are some other                                features that we might give up if we                                know that people have shell access like                                the install a module through the web                                thing which you know sounds great                                unfortunately the way that it's                                implemented it requires a lot of your                                server namely you have to have the ftp                                PHP extension or this ssh PHP extension                                which hardly anyone has so effectively                                that feature is neutered by its security                                requirements so you know one other point                                I want to make about the web hosting is                                that our current range was really                                developed in a time before where we are                                now which is that VPS and virtualization                                is                                were prevalent you can buy a VPS for ten                                dollars i know you can definitely get it                                per month maybe they have it for five                                but the point is that's not too                                expensive anymore naturally it requires                                a bit more distant bin experience to                                manage apt-get is not hard to use but                                the point is it's more than nothing and                                the other web hosting requirement is                                that level would be the development                                teams can assume that you have a PC                                installed when we are writing software                                which impacts exactly you know the                                 things we care about and so we had you                                 know huge discussions about this                                 function registry during the development                                 of Drupal                                                               the only one was that it was really                                 great for people who did not have a PC                                 and it was less important for people who                                 had a PC and so a lot of development                                 cycles went to something that a lot of                                 Drupal customers wouldn't benefit as                                 much from that eventually got rolled                                 back so it's a little bit of a moot                                 point now and you know I think most                                 people are happy it got rolled back but                                 that's something to think about we                                 raised it a lot of cycles there if we                                 could assume that everyone had a pc then                                 we may not have proceeded with that                                 project all right well I think that's                                 enough for me I want to hear from other                                 people about target audience and web                                 hosting requirements and we'll see where                                 we go Jeff                                 right I guess one other thing I want to                                 introduce a conversation then I'll get                                 to the hands that are up I'll remember                                 where you guys are you can take it down                                 is that at some point on the low end                                 these people might want to look at                                 drupal service providers ok so Gardens                                 is a big one buzzer is another one you                                 know people like hot Drupal who                                 specialize in drupal hosting our                                 services that weren't around a few years                                 ago when we made this broad range so i                                 think if you get low enough there are                                 people who are very happy to take your                                 business and they actually do it with                                 varnish and memcache and stuff that you                                 would never set up for yourself so you                                 might actually get                                 a better experience and still pay not a                                 lot of money alright so let's go here                                 that's right so if VPS is really a poor                                 term for what I mean it means that                                 whoever is hosting your website can deal                                 with Drupal's increased requirements web                                 posting requirements yeah                                 right right ok so then                                 and not running locally means that                                 there's not a point of presence near you                                 or yeah okay yeah mm-hmm okay you know                                 you know one approach is well the market                                 will provide that right I mean we have                                 lots of entrepreneurs here from                                 Australia maybe they will make something                                 that appeals to that audience right okay                                 that's a good point                                 I think                                 right here                                 the suggestion is to more quickly                                 upgrade our pH be our base PHP                                 requirement it's                                                    guess the suggestion is to go to                                         Drupal                                                               think we can go higher than that since                                 five for is an alpha                                 yeah they usually make both available                                 right for some period of time                                 you                                 yeah okay you had a chance is there                                 anyone else right in the back                                 yeah I mean I think it's a good                                 distinction it's a good distinction to                                 say that your production server might be                                 the one that has to have increased                                 requirements but not your devs yep                                 it is amazing but it's true they don't                                 have it and every performance                                 optimization you might think of it pales                                 in comparison to that one we're hands                                 over here                                 it's more for the developer the                                 developer understanding and focus when                                 we broaden the talk to what is Drupal's                                 target audience and should it have a                                 narrower target target audience would we                                 thrive that way you know there was some                                 interesting data about we're losing the                                 raw number of sites but we're gaining                                 the high-end sites would be we be                                 happier with fifty percent of the sites                                 we have now but it's more focused group                                 like mid-range and high-end clients you                                 know so                                 yeah it's true I mean it's something to                                 consider and how you got here isn't                                 necessarily where you should always stay                                 but you know that's not something you                                 turn your back on lightly yeah                                 Greg                                 alright other hands right here                                 right so be mindful of all the                                 nonprofits use it all the way in the                                 back yep                                 okay I don't think that at least the                                 requirements i mentioned are in that                                 category like you don't have to set up                                 memcache in order to run Drupal that                                 wasn't one of the proposals but somebody                                 could suggest a requirement that                                 inhibits the development environments                                 here Jake's                                 we talked about that a little while ago                                 I don't know maybe you weren't in but we                                 did mention that there are service                                 providers and there will be more that                                 could handle that class of customer ok                                 right back here ok we we don't like it                                 when people copy paste commands                                 yeah and a PC even if we got that it                                 would just be a recommendation because                                 it really doesn't do anything if you if                                 you sit worked on a web server they                                 didn't have a PC all this everything                                 would work it would just be slow                                 mm-hmm right so anything that could                                 reasonably be done in a browser Drupal                                 ought to have it be available in a                                 browser right I think it everyone would                                 agree with that but something like                                 deleting a text format I think even you                                 suggested like those sorts of things                                 maybe we could start relying on the                                 shell to do them                                 you                                 mm-hmm right right I think that the                                 problem comes in when we spend lots and                                 lots of cycles doing something that's                                 much better done on the shell and that                                 you know download a new module and                                 install it thing in Drupal                                               example of that back                                 yeah I mean seems like something that we                                 ought to do in any case yeah I thought                                 of another example that I'll share                                 during the Drupal                                                        a push to put poor man's Kron into                                 Drupal core it's on by default and it                                 does something that's pretty crazy it                                 like makes a new request back to Drupal                                 via hidden image and it it goes head and                                 calls something that chron dot PHP also                                 does alright I guess it calls into cronk                                 a journey that went into core eventually                                 and it had been implemented in the worst                                 possible way it you know the second                                 every single request in a Drupal caused                                 a second request into Drupal that did a                                 full bootstrap to check if cron was                                 needed to run and if it didn't it would                                 stop there and if it did it would run                                 cron so a lot of core developers had to                                 go now fix this thing that had toasted                                 performance in Drupal and you know that                                 was another saga so when we start doing                                 stuff that's better done in the shell we                                 really burn out our core development                                 team okay Jeff                                 okay Greg                                 you                                 I remember the patch was a good patch                                 but didn't go okay others right here                                 right maybe distributions are part of                                 the answer may be some distros can have                                 different requirements and others do you                                 ever hand up and Ryan no okay right here                                 you                                 right                                 okay good point right here                                 okay there's a notion that your web site                                 could be in a mode like this is a                                 production server and maybe we would                                 give messages based on that here yeah i                                 mean i think there's there's truth to                                 that if you have the answer for how core                                 development should come to agreements                                 that would be cool others all the way in                                 the back                                 all right good point Jeff can you                                 elaborate                                 all right I think that we've out of run                                 out of time for this core conversation                                 there's another one right behind me so                                 thanks everyone
