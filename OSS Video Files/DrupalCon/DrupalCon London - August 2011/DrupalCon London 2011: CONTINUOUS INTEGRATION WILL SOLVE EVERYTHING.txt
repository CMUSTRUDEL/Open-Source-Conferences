Martin Eskdale Moen
Continuous integration(CI) is the process of which a system is integrated on a continuous basis, leading to multiple integrations in a development cycle. This provides a means to monitor the quality of code, test it and receive quick notifications of errors.
It provides a quick overview of the current state of a project, from both a managers stand point and a programmer's.
It can turn integration from a multi day process to a non-event done on an hourly basis.
If you are simply creating your own blog to a full enterprise solution, this session will cover the basics of setting up a CI process and some of the challenges you might face.
