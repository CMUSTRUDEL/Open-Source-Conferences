Title: DrupalCon London 2011: CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION WILL SOLVE EVERYTHING
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Martin Eskdale Moen
Continuous integration(CI) is the process of which a system is integrated on a continuous basis, leading to multiple integrations in a development cycle. This provides a means to monitor the quality of code, test it and receive quick notifications of errors.
It provides a quick overview of the current state of a project, from both a managers stand point and a programmer's.
It can turn integration from a multi day process to a non-event done on an hourly basis.
If you are simply creating your own blog to a full enterprise solution, this session will cover the basics of setting up a CI process and some of the challenges you might face.

Topics covered:

No touch build as much as possible
Using an existing production database in the builds
CI servers
Drush make, build scripts, phing
Use of post commit hooks
Building a site using features
Using update hooks when features can't cover it
How it can be used to scale a team
General workflow
Preliminary slides:

Intended audience
Drupal developers and Drupal architects intending to build sites who wish to know on a frequent basis when their complete integration fails.

Questions answered by this session
Setting up a CI server to build a drupal site

Setting up a basic build script

Packaging a site into a single deployable file

How it can help team size issues

come on have you enjoyed your become                               excellent excellent alright so                               continuous integration will solve                               everything I think hopefully hey my name                               is Martin Bohm I am a drupal developer                               doing it for about five years that's me                                right there about me and all knows about                                it Twitter drupal.org go i joined cap                                last year where I did a lot of this work                                on continuous integration got a lot of                                experience with large development teams                                working together and why continues                                integration it's very important on large                                teams                                it's a little history first quickly the                                process is the continued integration use                                have been around for ya since the                                beginning of computed development commit                                programming I found some reports about                                the IBM when they were developing the OS                                                                                                       I have no idea how terrible that will be                                on that kind of system but maybe it                                worked but in late years extreme                                programming and agile have kind of                                brought continuous integration into a                                full-blown process and a defined                                end-to-end system and specifically                                martin fowler and camp back up two                                prominent names there Martin Fowler has                                written a great great article about this                                continuous integration what it is and                                how how it's used I recommend you read                                it it probably is the                                                about it in short so                                yes that's from his article continue                                situation is a software development                                practice where members of a team                                integrate work frequently used daily                                leading to multiple integrations a day                                what I also later says is that                                continuous integration then causes                                integration to become a non-event as in                                it happens you don't care about it it                                you get a report back saying your curls                                good who goes bad um as in the word                                continues its never-ending so it's all                                time going on however within that cycle                                do you still have start and stop points                                so every day for instance you might be                                doing hello ten times a day you might                                have a continuous integration run at the                                end of each run you'd see a report                                coming out and then you can add some new                                code have it rerun that's when you start                                to play                                so who use the CI us developers actually                                how many L developers in here                                Wow awesome site builders hey managers                                project managers and you on the left out                                themis I'm sorry s Themis sorry                                excellent cool so yeah developers use                                continues integration we use it locally                                on our machine we run the build script                                that builds a site that's considered                                continuous integration when we check in                                code into an SEM that's part of                                continuous integration because then it                                goes into being curled revealed so I                                builders use it because they can easily                                build a new site mock around do whatever                                they want and not worry about the fact                                that they can mock up this I completely                                destroy it rebuild it in split second                                and just go on about their life it it                                makes life a lot easier for SOPA which                                as well managers love it because they                                get an overview of what's going on in                                the project how is the code how is the                                health of the the feature you're doing a                                application you're making so all all                                continues negation is very good thing                                for everyone really so how many I've                                seen this now if you a single developer                                flowing the code maybe two three                                developers all right Chloe code hack                                goes to patch someone reviews it and                                this is a good patch yes you washing                                repeat if it's and though maybe that guy                                comes up and clubs you over the head                                with a hammer hopefully not the hammer                                but so this works this this works in                                small team right this works when you're                                                                                                    each other your round one table maybe                                what happens when you scale it                                 let's say you have this                                 I love my artwork let's say you have                                 this so you're a senior developer you                                 have five dollars off shore and they are                                 working on the module you're responsible                                 for feature an application on the sides                                 they work way and all the communication                                 they have with you is instant messenger                                 email a video conference call the ten                                 o'clock in the morning every day and                                 that doesn't even count for they may be                                 six seven-hour difference between you                                 right so when your communication line is                                 this thin because you don't actually                                 have that human interaction between you                                 how how can you get that same kind of                                 communication that you do when you only                                 five people and that's why you continues                                 integration is important because it                                 helps a lot so this is the whole group                                 right this is one kitchen your response                                 for this kitchen let's                                               they will talk together through I am how                                 do you how do you handle that one cool                                 XKCD good code we usually like to get em                                 somewhere between there we'd love to get                                 some way in between their weights                                 between taslim right yeah right codes                                 code well don't know you know the                                 picture you give all how many have you                                 have been here yes                                 portal codes                                 so why you see I                                 it improves the overall view wow that                                 came out actually a lot worse than I                                 thought it improves overall hbu so you                                 can see further you can see further into                                 the future of your project you can get a                                 better overview of how your code is the                                 health makes goals either focus on                                 future you know where you are now you                                 can easily say where you're going to be                                 by knowing that your codes working a lot                                 quality assurance so all the time in                                 continuous integration they talk about                                 proteins integration they always talk                                 about simple tests and QA right voltage                                 runs in a in Drupal is an interesting                                 beasts need to pass some tests right                                 yeah status of those tests passing and                                 you set the flag in the ground but how                                 do you know everything on your site                                 works are you going to sit down click                                 every single link and just hope and you                                 know usually you throw it out then you                                 you you really hope right you don't know                                 every single link unless you have                                     people sitting around all day long                                 clicking links it might happen                                 so where to saw on this where do you                                 start with this monolithic task the same                                 place they building my way wow that's                                 good that guy has got you know sitting                                 there I was on there no thanks I'm all                                 right build you start with he built you                                 start with scripts here are some ones                                 who talk about when people say                                 continuous integration diesel of some of                                 the ones come to mind at least when it                                 comes to the PHP world my colleague                                 Marcus Douglas was talking about                                 capistrano where we shall know it kind                                 of is between servers and build scripts                                 because you can define things in webster                                 on oh and but you can also have it                                 rhonda same things thing here's an                                 excellent aunt clone so some ways you                                 can define a lovely xml layout and it                                 will run it to tile content and you get                                 actually decent stuff sort I'll show                                 something XML to after this you can                                 write it all in PHP                                 gives you great flexibility but it's                                 kind of like writing your own CMS again                                 you know you were sitting at home for y                                 al write my own CMS that's a great idea                                 I think I came to my third on the five                                 felt this is terrible drupal yes so now                                 you have your build scripts                                 Josh mag to sort of build script yeah we                                 build script service you need something                                 to orchestrate it need something to go                                 off every day relentlessly no problem at                                 all just run it and tell people what's                                 going on on top of the list and putting                                 Jenkins mainly because it's been around                                 as Hudson for quite long time some when                                 they got bought by oracle oracle decided                                 wow well what's nuts our name will not                                 let you have that anymore so they                                 off and rated Jenkins which is pretty                                 much Hudson will even find Hudson in the                                 word strength inside Jenkinson placed                                 cruise control nor the driver one have                                 not used the tour sorry to say though                                 some great things about it the UI looks                                 really nice buildbot python-based one                                 and it's the UI is okay I wouldn't put                                 it in front of a first time user                                 go on Wikipedia just look up continues                                 and version you'll find massive list of                                 service that will do all the same tasks                                 and love them proprietary martin fowler                                 at                                                           so now you've got your build script and                                 your server are there what's next well                                 now you need to create those stat tests                                 right the status reports the things that                                 managers love to see and the things that                                 else developers really need to know what                                 we're doing wrong simple dust I hope                                 everyone knows this one anyone not know                                 it yeah cool everyone's are the drupal                                 simplest write them in every module we                                 make write a simple test please it makes                                 the work for guys like me you have to                                 you know run these tests all the time                                 much easier if there is one there                                 selenium selenium is a cool tool it's                                 pretty much automated human eyes in some                                 ways you can sit down install firefox                                 installed selenium plug in and click                                 around and it will record all it it's                                 kind of like a glorious macro script and                                 what's really cool is when you get into                                 gritted it's really truly human sorry so                                 that you can have massive graded                                 machines all running different os's all                                 running different versions of the                                 browser and they all will then selenium                                 will then automatically check on each of                                 these browsers right                                 so that you will get back a report                                 saying this pixel is not we're supposed                                 to be old but this image is not we're                                 supposed to be you can get really really                                 good sales reports from selenium about                                 what's wrong with your actual graphical                                 output                                 simple test checks your HTML s'alright                                 selenium action tests graph the browser                                 shows you PHP mass detector how many of                                 you heard this                                 ah alright it's not completely unknown                                 yet PHP mass detector is kind of a it                                 checks for security holes checks for                                 this that's what they said the checks                                 for it checks for kind of stupid things                                 to do in PHP code it will look at your                                 colon go like you're stupid you've done                                 it wrong redo it a it's a it's one of                                 these you add to the Arsenal after a                                 while once you've got the two top ones                                 down you'd start adding mass vector it's                                 kind of a developer's tool but it goes                                 into contains integration it goes into                                 the Jenkins server Jenkins runs it each                                 time and says if you're stupid or colder                                 in Drupal go to module guys using it                                 Aaron using it hopefully yep cool it you                                 all know what does some homework until                                 go into XH prof so your codes is ronik                                 it's running great it works it's got all                                 the features you want is it running                                 performance                                 so your page takes                                                    I've seen it it's in                                                     why does it take                                                        do you track that one down I mean                                 Drupal's got some built-in tools yeah                                 they work there what if it's in the boot                                 script or why why this other places so

                           were all kind of things exhales probe                                 was written by the guys at Facebook                                 don't don't listen throw don't worry                                 it's quite good actually um it's                                 straight into the devil modular and you                                 literally install it you

memory they used i'm sorry to say my                                 jenkins vm died so i was going to show                                 you XH proof that my Jenkins being died                                 like literally last night I've been                                 hacking my way at it and it's annoying                                 the live living daylight out XD bug you                                 don't step through your code how many of                                 you have tried to step through PHP code                                 cool excellent you guys actually using                                 you know tools that are helping you this                                 is good not just putting in break points                                 on exit and exit bug it's actually got                                 some performance tools as well and it's                                 got code coverage tools strangely enough                                 and it will allow you to step through                                 code and netbeans has a great interface                                 to                                 I've never managed to get eclipse                                 working with it and this will mothers                                 out there as well                                 PHP CPD have any of you heard it before                                 route to                                 PHP copy paste detector so you have copy                                 and pasted code it will tell you or not                                 you someone else it will tell you you                                 can go through with a hammer now and hit                                 them over the head                                 it's great rolling it sometimes and just                                 feel like why so that was old tools                                 let's move on again so in continuous                                 integration the idea is to do it often                                 right now a few three short mantras and                                 speak up please it has to be repeatable                                 doesn't matter what steps you think are                                 complicated it's always repeatable and                                 it has to be repeatable                                 and has to be automated repeatable you                                 can't have a human interface going into                                 it and clicking some buttons it has to                                 be able to run at any time if you have a                                 database dump coming back every day and                                 you're deleting all the old ones then                                 keep some of the old ones you need to be                                 able to run it at any point at any time                                 otherwise it's pointless in really                                 having it because you might have checked                                 some code that was I don't know five                                 hours old you checked in a bunch of                                 developers offshore and a bunch of                                 developers here have checked in loads of                                 code what the hell do you do now                                 they have to be known steps don't use                                 black boxes don't use something you                                 don't can't look inside and actually                                 know what it's doing it can't be scary                                 if you if you use in something if you're                                 using some magical tool that gives you                                 loads of interesting results that you                                 actually have no idea what it's doing                                 inside so yeah it has been an steps                                 right configuration I'm not going to                                 talk much about I'm just going to tell                                 you something about it because it's been                                 plenty of talk this week about                                 configuration in turn to talk about                                 deployment developers hands off you'll                                 not allow the torch configuration when                                 the site is built no one on your team                                 except for site administrators allowed                                 to touch the site when it's built                                 doesn't matter how complicated you can                                 code then hook update features sequel                                 scripts but the point is this is why the                                 repeatable if you have to go into the                                 site to click some button somewhere or                                 set some smtp house or something like                                 that it's not repeatable anymore                                 continuous integration is broken you're                                 stupid                                 so                                 very simple just if if you ever think                                 all right I have to go stop                                 digression                                 come back to the game going                                 configuration has to be able to work                                 across multiple environments I mean if                                 you have one environments                                 you don't really need continuous                                 integration if if you're running from                                 your local machine you can try I mean                                 why not Ron continuation have a building                                 local machine every day and it could                                 work don't really need to worry about                                 configurational too much if you have one                                 site good for you you have got a bit                                 further and multiple sites in                                 configuration gets interesting right                                 so you have huge fights here and you                                 have different varmints this is actually                                 quite few I've seen like                                                scary                                 that's your local dev machine you have                                 to be able to connect the site a                                 configuration with the local dev machine                                 so in thing for instance you can do this                                 easily you have properties files they                                 can override each other you can set a                                 rush to automatically go for the                                 properties files and pick up certain                                 properties to use as your site                                 configuration then staying for the                                 environment I know this is in Drupal                                   loads of talk about this I haven't                                 called it too closely I'm sorry                                 same thing for testing this works in                                 Drupal sevens same thing for testing and                                 but now you have to be able you have to                                 check in that code but over this has to                                 be checked in because the next developer                                 has to be able to come along and just                                 run script and instantly have the same                                 environments you same thing for testing                                 you have to check that code in the                                 configuration has to be in code has be                                 able to go to North production now it                                 gets interesting introduction so if                                 you're moving into production from                                 testing hopefully in testing and                                 production dead ése                                 but there might not be you have to be                                 careful because you if you accidentally                                 check in some configuration that you                                 know enables everyone to edit everything                                 so yeah just a few things so humbling                                 the traffic you guys think I'm going to                                 talk about traffic shaping out something                                 don't you right well sort of this I like                                 it so wipe your optional team you have                                                                                                     checking in code all the time while                                 you're asleep the checking in code you                                 yeah you're talking about unbelievable                                 amounts of commits you come in in the                                 morning wrong svn up or get pull use it                                 every little while and you don't you can                                 go dig through the log I tried a few                                 times it was terrible because the                                 interfaces for these logs aren't exactly                                 beautiful                                 and you eat you that you don't know                                 hungers and what what all the change                                 start right and you're the senior                                 developer remember Garrett how many ever

differences it's also code review tool                                 so like I said it's like fish I however                                 gary is different and I'll show you why                                 now I'm actually do live demo scary so                                 just annoying                                 hey kiss my ass it's disappeared

                         after I tried the home front row plus                                 it's fantastic isn't almost there                                 so                                 thinkin topless what's in this                                 you guys hit now the back goes either                                 the back cool so this looks like an                                 script right few differences we got that                                 one there got a few things here                                 so this is pretty much a fing scripts                                 you have your Josh command which is in                                 the Drupal community it's a add on to                                 thing so you have to go and get that one                                 if you think it works really really well                                 even though it's still in sandbox mode                                 you can really do a lot anything you can                                 create directories you can set                                 permissions and it has some cool concept                                 rather targets so you have to win since                                 the first to prepare your profit sorry                                 my mouth is not connected to my brain                                 anymore first X to prepare your director                                 is right to run Josh make and I wanted                                 to be a development version so I've got                                 working copy research                                 and then you have to install the site                                 and literally a psych install it's easy                                 thing makes your life easier it really                                 so isn't a bit like puppet em yes and no                                 he can deploy files and they can                                 configure that's not a problem but it's                                 really not for system configuration it's                                 for Drupal on PHP projects so you don't                                 yeah I'll take questions at the end I'll                                 still got plans I'm don't worry I'll                                 take questions young try to

so how many you skip                                 cool how many used svm how many feel                                 comfortable we'll get cool so you know a                                 bit about how the branching of how the                                 check-in can work sometimes with a git                                 repository nice so just I just changed                                 my makefile right it's not this                                 yep mother bear's neck cool and I do ray                                 I can ever remember this one                                 get push actually no Adele sorry my bad                                 I do a git commit first of course I'm                                 stupid                                 already I'm missing                                 message changed all right                                 that's it                                 now this is the interesting one about                                 Gary                                 so you have your push you push it                                 through a sh you push it to a custom                                 port so Garrett wants its own SSH so                                 there are a few reasons were mainly                                 because it's all in Java so it's all                                 encapsulated so when you run Gary you                                 can have all your get users only in                                 garrets and you don't have to create                                 them linux accounts or use any other                                 means and it's very very easy to                                 register new accounts it's literally a                                 google accounts or you can use your own                                 with invitational you create an account                                 you put in your pop key that's it you                                 can start checking code it's like github                                 he will be like running your own github                                 on your own machine except it's not                                 really getting so I want to push in to                                 make files I'll push my head into the                                 references for master go cause                                 using a                                 I thought it was smart right don't fail                                 top fell                                 wow you don't luton the number of times                                 I've actually checked in code and it's                                 worked fine ok area just nice to                                 computer being slow so you normally get                                 checking even gives you a link to the                                 new changes so now we've checked in what                                 happens next                                 get them                                 you go                                 right                                 so you used Gary before some of you guys                                 have seen us so I updates and files                                 earlier obviously now what this is is                                 all the change requests that have come                                 in all the patches that have come in and                                 they're not actually in your git                                 repository they're not in your main get                                 repository yet they're still in the                                 queue waiting to be checked in so                                 remember what i said earlier how do you                                 handle the traffic coming in from all                                 the developers this is how you you you                                 you gated you you stop them from being                                 able to check it in to the main poster                                 that goes into jenkins and it works                                 really well because you can have a                                 verifier and the code review so we go                                 look at the one i just did now needs to                                 be verified needs code ravine how are                                 you guys at the back seeing this or not                                 how are you blind eyes cool good                                 so you know you got you all your author                                 committer bra so you can do a dip side                                 by side you can see I added my country                                 you can double click you can add                                 comments which go back to the developer                                 you can tell them you're stupider                                 it's really really nice it really will                                 help if you use Garrett and each time                                 someone checks in he goes in here before                                 even touches to the main git repository                                 that that goes even if it's almost a                                 will get repository it will help you                                 catch the realest tupid stuff                                 so go back to all my open locks changed                                 gives us review in progress                                 so I hit now I have two accounts i'll                                 put it together I can I've set up                                 information sir can review it myself and                                 they can even prove it myself but I'm                                 not going to because basically what                                 happens is that you would have two                                 people or you'd have Jenkins and a                                 little person the first person would say                                 looks good to me that means one else to                                 prove it this can either be Jenkins                                 which could be scary but if Jenkins says                                 yep the codes fine it can approve it and                                 say it's okay however if you just want                                 to people yeah publish box top if we go                                 to my wow that's my firefox                                 it's gone                                 it's completely gone excellent i'll

my point is that you see                                 most benefit when you have big teams                                 because when you just to give three guys                                 around the table it's not hard to talk                                 to each other and saying like yeah I did                                 the things the code now can you you know                                 pull                                 I works a lot with the design                                 right yeah                                 right yeah okay                                 there you go yeah it works yes right                                 so do you Ron Jenkins on every commit                                 depends on how you have set up Jenkins                                 if you have set up Jenkins to have                                 projects for every single little feature                                 and every single little module you have                                 then yes you do because then you get an                                 instant response for that one module if                                 you have Jenkins run the whole site and                                 if your site contains you know                                     modules if they do exist then no you                                 have a check every                                                     half an hour and then you they will run                                 then if there has been anything and                                 collects together a whole bunch of                                 hey boss yep                                 so if you have a preview environment so                                 other than you mean if so I'll just                                 reiterate its question for the recording                                 if you have a preview environment would                                 be happy to run Jenkins every hour um                                 really depends on your setup                                 but if I'm honest on your question                                 correctly do you mean all the content                                 that's in there how do you migrate that                                 across or                                 the lady's right                                 Wow interesting okay and no because                                 that's the kind of environment when he                                 goes to the client that's kind of a user                                 acceptance so Jenkins would have a task                                 in its job to push to that server but                                 that would almost have to be a manual if                                 it takes that long to build your site                                 you have to have a manual button in                                 Jenkins and when when you're happy with                                 the state of the code you say go and it                                 builds that site but having Jenkins                                 running every                                                            a very split of environment where you                                 have multiple preview service and you                                 somehow have a low bounce in front they                                 can choose which server that's Josh                                 being built just finish building etc                                 right so when it takes that long to run                                 against the preview environment you do                                 manually you right there going on press                                 the button manually the project manager                                 doesn't                                 yes                                 yep                                 what                                 well one of the talks early this week                                 was on kind of that small differences                                 which they used features and an install                                 profile so what you do you see to have                                 two different install profiles and you'd                                 have enabled in one and install profile                                 not in the other alternatively you can                                 do it in the fing scripts you can have                                 it enable module you have two different                                 thing scripts that roll into it with two                                 different environments there's several                                 ways of skinning this cat of enabling                                 disabling features or modules sorry yes                                 beside
