Display Suite offers you a drag and drop UI that allows you to easily manage the layout of your site in a consistent and centralized way.

In this session we will show you what Display Suite offers out of the box, but also the more advanced features. Developers will learn how to extend its power by adding custom (block) fields, formatters and layouts.

	                              we're going to show you a lot of demo                               because the best way to see and well                               experienced display suite is well you                               see it so that's the first slide okay                               Joey your turn so it's still my turn                               okay I'm sorry very important thing                               we're crimson crew members that's our                               van somehow our boss managed to crash it                               somewhere in Germany so we had we came                                with another van so well with Drupal                                ninjas alright the outline so now that                                you know how crazy we are the agenda for                                today we'll talk about the philosophy                                behind this why was it built then as                                most mental mentioned we have some demos                                going from the very basics in this play                                sweet to the more advanced stuff we'll                                also touch on the search integration the                                some advanced use cases then the                                combination with panels which is quite                                powerful and you know that a lot of                                people think it's competition but it's a                                powerful combination if used well then                                we go to a slightly more technical level                                with the API and performance very                                important to quickly touch on the future                                and there will be time for some                                questions and answers all right                                philosophy so why did we write this                                place we'd it's started I think three                                years ago now where we had really large                                complex web sites and work and we were                                getting quite frustrated I mean I'm a                                developer he's a team or so we have to                                work together all the time and then when                                we had those large projects we had a lot                                of complications especially when when                                your project is life then you get new                                feature requests from clients and stuff                                like that and then we really get into                                trouble because well changing stuff with                                the Drupal teaming layer is extremely                                flexible I mean Drupal you can do                                basically anything                                and you have teaming functions you have                                template files you have pre-process                                functions you have okay you have your                                template files when you have also                                teaming settings so there's a lot of                                stuff scattered around you also have                                views you can also use use to well add                                fields to like say a page and stuff like                                that so at the end you don't really                                enemy you don't know anymore where your                                content is styled so you really have to                                have your own Road book because when a                                client comes in and asks you for a                                change you can re really in trouble                                especially if you haven't created                                project yourself if you take over a                                project from someone else your can we                                really stuck sometimes you really have                                to search in a lot of possible places                                and well I've seen some really really                                cool stuff and so we were really                                frustrated with that so we started                                thinking so one of the first goals for                                this place it was the ability to manage                                your layout from one central place you                                would have an interface where you have                                one page and then you see all your                                objects in your Drupal website so those                                are can be notes those can be viewer                                users those can even be views so it                                sounds weird we'll see a lot of stuff                                later in the demo site also eliminates                                template files which sounds weird but as                                a developer I became a little bit                                frustrated because I had to provide the                                template files from my team errs because                                my team is don't know that well PHP                                which is I'm sorry okay other James yeah                                no not to generalize this but it can be                                really frustrating because I don't I'm                                not really interested in deeming stuff I                                just want to make cool modules and hack                                into core and stuff like that I don't                                want to provide my team used a their                                template files also PHP code if you if                                you went for instance to the security                                session there's a lot of stuff that you                                can misuse with PHP exploits and stuff                                like that I've seen template files with                                pray                                in them which is Wow so please don't do                                that so our goal was also to eliminate                                template files I have a really cool                                point in focus on ease of use                                Portability and manageability which I                                 completely forgot why I wrote that very                                 important this place we'd is not a CSI                                 still I've got well I'm getting a lot of                                 questions on my issue queue I'm doing                                 this with a class and stuff like that                                 that's not what we've built this for if                                 you want do you see as as you sweep or                                 something like that a little marketing                                 all right so I'll go hand over to Joe if                                 now he will be showing you a lot of demo                                 stuff we'll have to switch as well                                 switch chairs so before we show display                                 sweet I just want to give a quick demo                                 on how you can manage your layout                                 without display sweet so using the                                 normal filter by and templates and for                                 that we've created a very nice chicken                                 Maurice fansite any fans that are here                                 can upload or here I don't know our                                 other stands is good so what you                                 normally have if you look at in Drupal                                 add structure content types you get a                                 managed displaylink what you see here is                                 body image and you can move them around                                 you can hide them but that's basically                                 it's the options are there but there are                                 quite limited from the moment you want                                 to fiddle with your both dates comments                                 all the other extras other printed you                                 have to go to template files which is                                 it's nice to have this but if you can go                                 one hundred percent then it's quite                                 useless in my opinion so if you look at                                 the slides again we would be good in                                 this one year                                 voila so we get a mix of template files                                 and field you I disadvantages are that                                 template files are not in my opinion                                 female friendly it's not because you can                                 write CSS and HTML that you should be                                 able to manipulate PHP files                                 maintainability is an issue you have                                 some stuff in your database some stuff                                 in template files the limitations you've                                 got at extra fields extra few modes and                                 then the fourth point you added further                                 what it means no no the longer we just                                 skip that one and you can't indeed use                                 templates so you have your fields in a                                 list but you can't say put this one left                                 this one right so you have to write some                                 complex CSS for that and which can be a                                 pain so in comes display sweet i'll just                                 give a demo first so that you can see                                 what is what it's all about back to                                 check Maris it's a module that consists                                 out of                                                            modules and that's display sweet and                                 then                                                                 display which I'll add on later                                 if I go back to the same screen                                 structure content types I have the same                                 link here everything looks exactly the                                 same but I've now the option to choose a                                 layout or just open the page itself so                                 let's say the acting career of Jack                                 Morris this is your default note you                                 have your estimated date your content                                 all the images in a row not really fancy                                 comment at the bottom so let's start to                                 fiddle around with it if I choose a                                 layout I'll just take the one column                                 very simple layout for this demo I                                 should take no I'll switch to full                                 content so this is the full content page                                 that I'm looking at my mouse is reversed                                 it's nice so full contents body image I                                 select my one column layout I'll leave                                 the rest as this for now save and then                                 all of the time you get all these extra                                 fields every field that's in your notes                                 is now available for displaying or                                 hiding so let's say I want my body of                                 course don't care about the post date I                                 want my image in my body you've seen six                                 or seven images on the page but with a                                 simple click you can just show the first                                 one I'll even add some image cache to                                 its medium into nothing okay comments                                 should be at the bottom and voila and                                 then save and let's look at the page                                 well so I have my image here my body the                                 comments at the bottom this is the very                                 basic use of the s suggest manager                                 fields fill the rounded it's the main                                 benefit here is that you don't have                                 other stuff sitting in your template                                 file so that you can manage like the day                                 like other small things that add it in a                                 node template file you don't see them                                 here it's just what you manage is what                                 you see oh thank you so there's more to                                 this place treat of course we've added                                 we've moved around these fields you can                                 also add custom fields if you want to                                 the start with a dynamic field the names                                 are a bit different difficult I mean so                                 what you have you have a code field lane                                 PHP you get your element that you want                                 you can play around with it add tags to                                 it manipulated use tokens indeed then                                 dynamic fields I'll show you an example                                 this gives you the sea tools layouts or                                 the panels layout as you might call it                                 to add custom fields you can add entire                                 blocks into your objects and people just                                 feel this way two technicals I won't                                 touch on that a dynamic fluid this might                                 look familiar to some people I'll call                                 it all images mala it's a note entity                                 safe what I have now is this all images                                 field I'll just know add above my                                 comments then I'll select content for it                                 I go to my note image field this should                                 not be a label for it and the formatter                                 should be image yeah so the image style                                 here is a thumbnail that was the one I                                 was looking for and link it to the file                                 finish voila updates save then reload my                                 page                                 and I get all these images nicely at the                                 bottom I've added some serious in                                 preparation just so that you know not a                                 CSS still so we've added fields I put ad                                 block field too I'll just take a very                                 simple one with a very proud to use                                 Drupal so i'll use the drupal block                                 nodes you see all the blocks here that                                 you get in your block overview screen so                                 i'll take the power by drupal one you                                 could choose a layout being rendered the                                 full block or just show the title and                                 contents or just show the content it's a                                 detail but we've added as use cases so                                 i'll just leave it as default voila add                                 it between my content and images save                                 reload and voila it's here so in this                                 way you can really manage your node                                 template you can add whatever you want                                 you can add custom fields you can add                                 dynamic fields block fields you can                                 really mess around with it then let's                                 look at the home page because we have                                 some teasers there mm-hmm not so useful                                 voila the short way so these are teasers                                 I've mentioned view modes before for                                 those who don't know what few modes are                                 by default you get several view modes of                                 it by drupal and they are in fact a                                 certain perspective on the same type of                                 contents so you have in this case the                                 teaser which is this we have the full                                 content which is your typical note                                 detail and there are some more technical                                 ones but easily and full note or main                                 used ones but I don't like the layout of                                 this so I'll play around with it too                                 select my layout first I'll take my                                 favorites the fluid three column stacked                                 you can hide empty regions which is nice                                 in this three column version you can                                 hide left or right if you don't have any                                 Content the rest stays as this voila I                                 can put my image on the left then the                                 body in the middle maybe prostate and                                 need it voila and the title of course                                 voila it's linked you have several extra                                 options like linkage which rapper do you                                 want which class do you want but it's                                 okay like that mala safe reload it's                                 better oh my images are still here and                                 that's because I haven't changed this to                                 one and this to the thumbnail version                                 voila this should be better nice now                                 this teaser looks great here but if i go                                 to my acting career page i have a list                                 of other articles in my sidebar but it's                                 a bit too busy for me I don't want to                                 show all the text again I don't want to                                 show images so in this case this is a                                 typical use case for the next review                                 mode you want the same content to                                 display it otherwise normally if you use                                 vuze you would select views fields the                                 disadvantage in that case is that you                                 have different HTML output it's really                                 frustrating as a team ER to have HTML                                 printed by your note template for                                 example and then use HTML you have the                                 same contents but different HTML so                                 duplicate CSS in this case                                 let's add a few mode will go to                                 structure display sweet view modes will                                 add a custom view mode I'll call it                                 small teaser voila note save if I now go                                 back to my article I can activate it a                                 small teaser so that we can use it for                                 this specific content type safe and you                                 just get it next to the other tabs so                                 what do I want a very simple layout I'll                                 use one column save just give me the                                 title make sure it's linked valla safe                                 now if I go to this page and I change my                                 view this is where we jump to views                                 integration which is quite important to                                 normally in views you have the option to                                 choose or type in custom fields or to                                 use a view mode offered by drupal in                                 this case we also have displays sweet if                                 I activate that you get all your display                                 street view modes so there's a lot more                                 options there than just full content and                                 teaser so i'll change the small teaser                                 here there are some more options here                                 which will show later on voila apply                                 save my view voila I just get a nice                                 list of titles next up just have to                                 think because it's quite a big demo I                                 have to cheat first home page view modes                                 use integration yeah ok choose                                 intubation let's go into more details on                                 the home page it's a typical use case it                                 was one of these cases for this in the                                 beginning to you have this home page you                                 have a list of six items but the                                 designer wants the first item to be                                 different there should be an image in                                 there more content it happens all the                                 time in our business so we had to invent                                 some way to do it too so if you go to                                 views then this the front page which I                                 will be changing I will choose to use                                 this place with two on this view by                                 default it should be the teaser so the                                 one that we saw just now but you can                                 also choose alternating view modes which                                 gives you for every item that you show                                 on that page in this case it's limited                                 by the pager so added only show six and                                 then show page so you can for every item                                 you can choose which view mode you want                                 i'll leave it to TZ TZ and then change                                 the others to small teaser voila save                                 and nothing happens because why would                                 like to quick caching just try it                                 shouldn't be the issue normally no it                                 should be the right view and I've saved                                 it just that's not a look at other                                 articles no no give me one more chance                                 to save my demo display sweets apply                                 settings you haven't oh yeah okay yeah                                 its usability

and there's also grouping in views                                 there's also a lot of other plugins but                                 I'll stick to this then beaverton notes                                 for now but you can also work on other                                 entities such as comments profile I'll                                 take leave a quick demo of the profile

fantastic picture of                                 Chuck Norris the fastest Romans and                                 deadliest man alive it's a small use                                 case but it happens so this was built I                                 think for two years now and every time                                 we have use case you try to fit it in                                 the module then comments another simple                                 example I'll go to the acting career                                 mala you have this by default as                                 comments I don't like the permalink I                                 don't like this method by so let's look                                 how we can change it I go back to my                                 articles manage to display then I get a                                 tap comment display and same thing here                                 I can choose the mail me with this one                                 hi the empty regions safe I can use the                                 user picture if we have fun I'm not sure                                 if we have one title don't care comment                                 itself is important voila and all the                                 rest I don't care about voila we load a                                 very nice picture of me and then the                                 comment itself so again whichever entity                                 you have in Drupal you can manage it                                 it's the same interface that you get                                 it's the same place to do it and the                                 same ease of use and think that's it for                                 the basic part maybe just look at the                                 HTML for those who care about that and                                 I'll use fire book which isn't installed                                 okay I won't use firebug haha can I get                                 a good demo here no one bothered you                                 with details in one of the benefits is                                 in fact that your HTML is the same you                                 get the same classes on your notes on                                 your comments on your User Profile block                                 and that's a huge benefit for gamers                                 very consistent CSS is a huge huge                                 benefit especially for maintainability                                 then back to the slides slideshow the                                 extras module so we've had a lot of                                 options already but the things that they                                 couldn't fit into the DA's module we                                 added into the extras module some                                 examples which I'll show you too is                                 filled templates again targeted at                                 femurs we don't like all the HTML that                                 Drupal prints out because it can be                                 quite a mess you can move your regions                                 from this to a block I'll show you a                                 nice use case to contextual links it's                                 very useful it's a small one but very                                 useful you can override your page title                                 you can switch between view modes on the                                 front end you can even manage your views                                 in the same way as we did with the notes                                 and there's a lot more but you'll have                                 to try it out yourself so templates map                                 if I go to modules extras save                                 then I get a nice set of options under                                 structure display streets and extras the                                 first one is filled templates I'll just                                 enable it if you do so it's it's aimed                                 at steamers so most of you won't use it                                 I'm guessing but my type of developer                                 it's quite useful so we have two options                                 or you reset which means to about                                 everything that you can make it as clean                                 as possible or stick to the Drupal                                 default which of course we don't want                                 mala resets there's advanced options                                 link to fill templates meaning you can                                 use hooks to create your own field                                 templates and stuff but that's again to                                 complicate it to show so every gives me                                 neva save it then we go back to the                                 article at the hope I can show it in the                                 HTML let's go to acting career yes                                 normally this image would have been                                 wrapped in diff filed items field items                                 field item image whatever HTML that you                                 could imagine and now yes yes stop                                 indeed so what you get here is this diff                                 voila you get your simple diff that                                 wraps your note which you need any way                                 at the theme mitigates note article so                                 your content type and you get you if                                 your view mode so with this combination                                 you'll be able to really target your CSS                                 and then in that you only get the image                                 tag and the text so no other clutter                                 which is really a nice achievement it's                                 been added I think only a few weeks ago                                 but was a really nice addition then next                                 one is switch few modes you can I won't                                 show it but you could select a specific                                 view mode for one note so all in all                                 look the same but then that's one                                 specific nodes                                 shouldn't have images whatever you could                                 switch view mode just for one note if                                 you turn this on then with this link you                                 could you can add a link to your certain                                 to certain view modes and say let this                                 one switch to from desert to for example                                 small teaser there was a use case i'm                                 not sure what it was again I think it's                                 do it like a shopping basket with                                 showing a product in texts and then                                 switching to the image version of it so                                 with some imagination you could really                                 make another use case out of it                                 contextual links I'll just enable it                                 because it's so useful page title                                 options I will enable it and show it and                                 regions to block this is contextual                                 links one click and you go to your                                 layout so no searching which allow did I                                 use on which part of my sight really                                 useful lesions to block is also a very                                 nice one let's say I want this image                                 displayed on the right in my sidebar a                                 different region altogether and then I                                 go to my manage display I have to add a                                 block region which I'll call sidebar not                                 being very creative but hey voila ok I                                 prepared to heart apparently sidebar to                                 save voila if I go to my blog page                                 choose no I can continue I get my                                 sidebar here so i'll put it where I want                                 it to be shown which is sidebar and yes                                 indeed I've prepared this demo and if I                                 then go back to my article I'll go here                                 manage display the full content for you                                 I get this as                                 a region so I can drag with you every                                 field I want into that region and then                                 it will then be exposed to that block in                                 the sidebar this is very useful to link                                 content together on one page and yet                                 show it in different regions so the                                 image I'll have to take it from here                                 voila move it to the side bar save and                                 acting career voila so this block now                                 appears in the sidebar and very useful                                 feature to the other one was the page                                 title which I can show too it happens in                                 some cases that you just want this page                                 title to be something else and if you                                 want to do sorry we have to go to your                                 page template with Drupal core and then                                 we have to write some dirty hacks if                                 this page then this title not really                                 maintainable so for this full notes you                                 can choose H title show it hide it all                                 together or manually set it and you have                                 some nice tokens so I can follow copy                                 this or call it's an article                                 voila no title it's a typical example                                 and then your page title is change to                                 know hacking you at page template file                                 just leave it as is it's all possible                                 then a very nice one to one of my                                 favorites is few displays it's really

 had use cases where we show a list of                                 stores on one side and then we attach                                 when the shown on the right next to it

                  display which allows you to take over                                 your search results so this works for                                 Drupal core notes search results it also                                 works for Apache Solr there's a couple                                 of other search solutions out there it                                 should work out of the box and normally                                 so you have to do a couple of stuff                                 first of all again you go to structure                                 display sweet there's a new item he'll                                 here called search and it tells you                                 first of all there's a nice help page                                 here you have to go to search settings                                 of Drupal core itself what we have done                                 is we've created a new well search                                 option there's an extra hook now in                                 Drupal                                                                   your own search engine so we do that too                                 so it's called search display so you can                                 activate it and then it's the default                                 search module so we save that let me go                                 back to structure this place sweet let's                                 add this to the toolbar it's easier so                                 let me go back to search so you can                                 configure a couple of stuff here so                                 first of all this is a search engine I                                 don't have a patchy solar on my box                                 right now but if you would use apache                                 solr you can choose a patchy solar here                                 so it will create a patchy solar we                                 a little single function and then just                                 push out results to displace me to start                                 deeming it so you can also select                                 another view mode so search in Drupal                                 core there's a search result view mode                                 but it's not really consistent I mean if                                 you would drag the fields around and                                 then look at your search results it                                 won't really look like you want it I                                 mean it's using the search result TPL                                 file with this place we're completely                                 overriding that and you can really                                 manage it and like you want so for the                                 demo we're going to use the teaser view                                 mode there's some extra stuff that you                                 can do here like total results it's                                 actually pre process variable which you                                 can if you like / right I'll probably                                 add some options here to make it                                 configurable with tokens and stuff like                                 that there's a couple of more but search                                 is really cool right now so let's search                                 for chuck Chuck the man is not going to                                 work so this is now how our search                                 results look like um so this is an                                 article this or facts which we have to                                 the website if I would go back to this                                 place wheat and go to layout actually                                 that's do it differently so we've added                                 the it doesn't work here ok this is the                                 contextual links it should work on this                                 one as well but this is going to do to                                 turn okay it's right why isn't it                                 showing the image on the left hmm                                 okay right so bad content okay but you                                 get the idea i mean it's it's really                                 easy now to override your search results                                 and to have a consistent search result                                 or otherwise i mean if you have a lot of                                 content types in your website then it's                                 really hard to fill in the search result                                 TPL file and have a lot of if switched                                 switch statements to say if this is the                                 content type of dis then put that on the                                 left and blah blah blah and you go on                                 and on and on and on I've seen search                                 result TPL files which were really                                 really really big and really ugly so                                 let's search really easy it's it works                                 out of the box they have some nice stuff                                 that works with Apache Solr like s a                                 filter on language if you have a                                 multilingual site which we have to do a                                 lot then if you're on the side in the                                 Dutch website or on ya on the Dutch then                                 you own you filter directly on Dutch                                 articles if you're on the english one                                 yeah you get a picture so let's search                                 let's go back to the slides it's not                                 sure okay it also works on users I'm not                                 going to to show that I mean if you will                                 use the user search result on in triple                                 core it just shows you I think the user                                 name and the email with this place we                                 did over rights that and you can really                                 create beautiful layouts from from users                                 search results so there are advanced use                                 cases I don't think we have to go very                                 long in it so quickly just quickly and                                 with what we've shown so views nodes                                 comments profiles whatever you could                                 really come up with some nice use cases                                 one that's used while lots by ourselves                                 is in slide show no the front page big                                 slide show with different different                                 content types so you don't a news item                                 minutes an article a photo gallery and                                 in that case we just make an extra view                                 mode called slideshow for example and                                 for every content type we just arrange                                 the fields like we want to sew it slide                                 sure will never break so to say a very                                 simple use case but really handy and I                                 think it's might be up to you to a think                                 of a good use case if you want a very                                 cool cool t-shirt like we do so start                                 thinking and if you can challenge us                                 you'll get a free t-shirt all right                                 display sweet and panels this is it has                                 been a very hot topic at the beginning                                 someone mentioned to Earl or Merlin okay                                 of chaos that displays heat was the anti                                 panels luckily he's he tried it out                                 himself so he gave a presentation like                                 two weeks ago in drupalcamp LA where he                                 did this quote so I'm very happy with                                 that display sweet is not the anti                                 panels actually Earl has really pushed                                 me to look at the panel's editor which                                 if you install panels you don't get                                 nothing you only get the editor you have                                 to install a couple of other modules the                                 typical use case is the page manager                                 there's also the panel nodes there's                                 also mini panels so with panels alone                                 you don't have nothing so now with                                 display sweet you can actually use the                                 panel layout editor on the view modes                                 which is a really cool integration you                                 can actually use them together so for                                 some view modes you would just use the                                 field you I but if you have really                                 advanced use cases or you rather want to                                 use the panels lay down every time you                                 can just use it so i'll show you how it                                 works how it looks like                                 so the panel's integration is something                                 that left that I've put into the extras                                 module so you just go to panel view                                 modes you toggle this and then if you                                 would go to layout and say article then                                 you get your panels layout editor right                                 here so if I would go to full content                                 it's still going to be in field you why                                 because we have we have already                                 configured it but we can shred switch                                 okay revert we can switch to the panel's                                 editor if you                                                           panels we choose a layout and send it                                 two column layout from panels you can                                 add some default fields already if you                                 like save your layout and there you go                                 so you can now use the panels editor on                                 the view modes that come with Drupal                                 core so you can basically choose if you                                 like that was one of the biggest critics                                 that we got every time because in a way                                 what we do with this place we'd is                                 adding the other fields as well panels                                 has more options that come to see tools                                 of course we solve that a little bit                                 with the dynamic field as joyful as well                                 has showed so the dynamic field is                                 actually using all the content types                                 that are available through the sea tools                                 integration so panels and display sweet                                 everybody loves it right now so let me                                 go back we're almost at the end of the                                 session so I'll just                                 maybe just one small addition to the                                 previous slide I said that so I                                 mentioned that panels and display sweet                                 are a powerful combination and you                                 should see it or the way we use it is                                 that Paris is used for the page layout                                 so your header footer whatever just                                 complete take it over root panels but                                 the content itself is managed by DS so                                 you say that you want to see your notes                                 in that region for example but to note                                 itself is managed by this so if you use                                 the two together you get full page                                 control with panels and content control                                 with yes so the two work to go to the                                 video very well that's it all right I'm                                 going I'm going to skip this very fast                                 this way sweet if you have seen you can                                 really well configure it through the                                 user interface there's a lot of hooks                                 that we have for developers because as                                 we said we want to well bridge the gap                                 between teamers and developers                                 developers can implement hooks to create                                 the display fields so that's something                                 that's that's really interesting the                                 display fields are fields that just                                 going to output some content which do                                 not have any form input so if you have                                 your note form you have all your typical                                 fields but you want to do something with                                 that so those are really those display                                 fields you can have extra bucks for that                                 so you have extra because I'm sorry you                                 can implement I hook to create view                                 modes you can also create your own                                 custom template files if you like so                                 you're not limited to the template files                                 that we ship in by default you can                                 create them either in your theme we even                                 have a dress command to really quickly                                 create a skeleton so really easy and                                 really handling which is also very cool                                 everything is exportable now in seven                                 the Drupal                                                               some problems with the Drupal                                           it it has support for features                                 integration but it's it's sometimes a                                 little bit buggy in the Drupal                                           this place we depends on ctools and                                 everything                                 that you have seen from from settings so                                 if you have configured a layout then you                                 have a lot of settings all the view                                 modes all the fields aldi whatever i've                                 probably missed are now exportable                                 either to feature or features or the                                 bulk export that comes with c tools so                                 you can easily now use version control                                 and put all your settings into well svn                                 or gate or whatever you like so I'm not                                 going to talk about that is we're almost                                 done formance that is that's well always                                 the number one question especially with                                 Drupal                                                                 implications drupal                                            completely rewritten because of the fact                                 that especially field UI which is                                 basically cck came into core which is                                 good for me or for us let's put it that                                 way it's good for me because I get all                                 the end all the questions are every time                                 so I've completely rewritten the stuff                                 so if there are any performance impacts                                 it's just because now it's triple                                 quartet is going to be the overhead in                                 fact if you would look at the template                                 file it's using the same technique as                                 Drupal core so there's not really any                                 overhead anymore at opposed to the                                 Drupal                                                                okay so you've seen the demo where we                                 have configured a view and where we just                                 add it to the views title in that case                                 it's probably better performance wise to                                 use that technique but as soon as you                                 would add a field API field onto a views                                 then views will always load you full                                 entity so which is due to the fact that                                 filthy API is built up Earl is really                                 really pissed about that but he has to                                 load the full entity to get or to                                 display stuff with views so on that part                                 well there's not really a big problem                                 anymore entity cash is a module written                                 my Nataniel catchable                                 it's something that you should really                                 install anyway on your drupal site even                                 if you don't use this place to eat that                                 module is going to catch any entity into                                 cash tables so it's going t if you use                                 just the database it's going to be in                                 the cash tables you can use memcache and                                 stuff like that so you should always                                 install that module anyway if you don't                                 going to use a display sweet we don't                                 we're not going to force you but that's                                 a really cool module so the future I'm                                 probably going to skip that I mean it's                                 almost time some resources so first link                                 is a project based on page on drupal.org                                 documentation I've created                                           last week which was really a lot okay so                                 everything that's in this place we every                                 single little feature is on those videos                                 we have a little booklet I think do you                                 have booklets well or we have little                                 booklets at back which describes every                                 single video and the URL is underneath                                 it just watch it it's really handy and                                 under two other links it's my website                                 and also his website where we talk about                                 display sweet and announce stuff and                                 stuff like that so that's it any                                 questions                                 the use integration where you can                                 actually take a few displace me to                                 renounce the fields how does displace we                                 behave with the semantic views that's                                 been                                 yeah so the question is if this place we                                 takes over the views template file if it                                 is going to battle with semantic cubes I                                 think it's not going to battle I'm                                 looked at the classes that views also                                 spits out and there's especially a                                 couple of classes that are all really                                 important for views to work and special                                 THX integration so it shouldn't clash I                                 haven't tested it actually but I'm                                 pretty sure it should work maybe he                                 knows no we think yeah it should work                                 normally because I know that I have some                                 I had some troubles and with the Drupal                                                                                                     extra classes that fuse needs for THX                                 integrations for instance so it should                                 normally work so                                 this place I feel that way                                 so yeah so the question is why an extra                                 hook for those display fields I've                                 looked at the hook field extra fields                                 hook which is kind of limited because if                                 you enable this with if you choose a                                 layout you get it site or field for                                 instance sometimes you want just to have                                 a title with some rappers or no rappers                                 of stuff like that so with the display                                 fields you have the opportunity to                                 create for matters for those fields so                                 that's basically the main reason why I                                 did and I've looked at other                                 possibilities I've talked with I've                                 talked it through with if shadman but it                                 wasn't really possible to do it another                                 way so                                 so I haven't really tested the profile                                 to module at this point because well                                 with the entities now in core you have                                 you can manage fields already on the                                 triple core so we haven't used to                                 profile to for Drupal                                                   point we haven't really used it in                                 Drupal                                                              don't know I haven't tested it so yeah                                 I'm going to first to control the node                                 edit form no that's not our intention um                                 I've had that question a lot but for Deb                                 we're maintaining field group as well                                 field group module for Drupal                                            also really rewritten from ground up and                                 it it's much more powerful than the                                 Drupal                                                             whitfield group you can add extra                                 vertical tabs horizontal taps accordions                                 and stuff like that so we really want to                                 separate those two things so now display                                 suite is not going to take over those                                 forms thank you yeah yeah you see to say                                 about reactive layouts                                 would you be able to leave something                                 like this space or something like that                                 so question is responsive mobile and                                 stuff like that um in the Drupal                                   version this is module called mobile                                 tools which looks at at the headers of                                 the request and then just going to                                 render me on stuffing in another in                                 another way so I know the developer and                                 i've added have given him a batch where                                 he exposes another build mode so that                                 your you're actually allowed to say okay                                 if you're going to use mobile tools and                                 you have display suite installed and                                 you're looking at an article on a mobile                                 phone use the web yeah he called it the                                 mobile view mode I think so there are                                 some tools already available to do that                                 I think we haven't really had a lot of                                 experience with Danny yet I hope to have                                 some experience with that in the future                                 but it should be possible to just say                                 okay if you know that your request which                                 is coming in is coming from mobile you                                 can just pass on the note and or you can                                 change your view mode some for instance                                 and then just yeah you just configure it                                 in of course in the back end so it                                 should be possible yep yeah                                 yeah yeah so you don't really even need                                 a display suite for that there's I think                                 the patches and already so the                                 references project for Drupal                                   originally only had                                                    only like the title and the full node in                                 the patch that now when then just                                 exposes all the few modes which are                                 available so you just drag and Dean                                 reference in in the right and then you                                 select the View mode so the option to                                 duplicate stuff well you can with with                                 the dynamic field so you can create                                 either your own custom field I think you                                 have to use a custom field I think I                                 don't know if it oaken is available but                                 if you have a little basic knowledge of                                 PHP you can just create a custom field                                 put a peach be in there and then just                                 drag and drop around it so it's not in                                 by default because we didn't have the                                 use case yet and I think we didn't                                  attempt to do so a few weeks ago too but                                  you realize it was just too complex to                                  get it in it's it's quite crowded                                  already and to add another clone option                                  and duplicate fields and it's too                                  difficult so yeah custom fields dynamic                                  fields are the way to go                                  so question about context and our means                                  if the design I've dynamic field is                                  actually using the sea tools integration                                  so if you add a dynamic field on say an                                  article which is a note it's going to                                  pass in the node context by default so                                  you have that full context to use so for                                  instance what we've done last week is we                                  created a view which had a dinar which                                  had an argument and then just past we                                  created dynamic field and with the views                                  content paints just we selected that                                  view and then you could automatically                                  choose like say the node nid to pass in                                  as the context i'm working with with                                  Earl right now to put t context and                                  variance as well on the view modes which                                  if you know page manager and stuff like                                  that so that will be available quite                                  soon as well so you should be able to                                  add any sort of kind of context that you                                  want so a use case anybody know a                                  challenge for us ok then thank you for                                  listening I hope you learned a lot and                                  see you next time                                  you
