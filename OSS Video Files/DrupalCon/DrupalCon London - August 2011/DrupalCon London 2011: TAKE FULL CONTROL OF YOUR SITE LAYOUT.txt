Display Suite offers you a drag and drop UI that allows you to easily manage the layout of your site in a consistent and centralized way.

In this session we will show you what Display Suite offers out of the box, but also the more advanced features. Developers will learn how to extend its power by adding custom (block) fields, formatters and layouts. For themers we will show how using Display Suite can make you forget all about the template hell, and how it allows you to have clean and consistent HTML throughout your site.
