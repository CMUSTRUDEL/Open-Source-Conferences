While mobile websites are becoming a commodity, many developers still struggle with the task of connecting their Drupal sites with the mobile and tablet world. Thousands of desktop focused sites have been build in the past years, and many of them are now facing the challenge of adding a mobile strategy. The fact that Drupal is at this point primarily a desktop focused CMS, the technical solutions for adding this mobile layer are not always straightforward. The question can be asked if the Drupal CMS is holding us back or can we use Drupal to our advantage?

To date, several of ad hoc techniques have been developed to make the transition easier. Many of them are being bundled within the Mobile Tools module, and other techniques make use of already available modules such as context, panels, views and services.

After building several mobile websites, and native apps, we learned that several mobile strategies that can be chosen:

Lowest common denominator sites that run on the widest range of devices.
Mobile websites optimized for the latest browsers.
Mobile apps that can be purchased in app stores.
All of these strategies have their place in the current web ecosystem, but have different requirements.

This session will focus on the underlying mechanisms of Drupal that can help you in extending your current desktop offer mobile or to create a new Drupal strategy that incorporates mobile from the start.

This sessions will cover following topics:

What is a mobile content strategy and how to choose one.
Creating (scalable) architectures with Drupal that support your mobile strategy.
Drupal core functionality and contrib modules that help in creating a mobile website or native app.
This session would be highly complementary with any theming oriented session that discusses mobile design, user experience and javascript frameworks.

           going on it's a really fast moving space                                so quickly about me I moved in the group                                of space think around

the                                startup ceased to exist in                                              a full-time trooper consultant a lot of                                Drupal work we need a lot of mobile                                sites for big lines                                                    and also some smaller ones and now i'm                                at a consumer search and that's the                                Department of New York Times and about                                to come and we also focus a lot on                                mobile I mean thanks four modules                                remember mainly mobile tools that's                                having used module that can help you in                                building a mobile site or can help you                                prototyping mobile sites some of you who                                have used mobile tools will know that it                                has a lot of functionality a lot of                                features and maybe you don't need all                                these features so you can use mobile                                tools you can just take some IDs out of                                it for me it was always a kind of a box                                where experimented with try to see how                                far I can go with Drupal and                                we're full can be useful to do device                                detection in Drupal the other modules                                are fairly low key not a lot of users                                but in case you were interested in one                                of these always looking for calming                                dinners so quickly consumers search we                                are like I said particleboard calm and                                the New York Times we focus on bringing                                information to users about consumer                                goods we have a big editorial team we                                try to make high-quality contents and of                                course you have a mobile website that we                                build in                                                                search everywhere when they need                                information about our products so you                                can always go to the website definitely                                if you're from the US can be kind of                                interesting however not too much about                                that more about triple just some numbers                                we are very high traffic sites and                                actually we saw a doubling of mobile                                traffic in the last year the growth has                                been steadily there are no big changes                                in the last year having a mobile site                                strangely did not increase traffic                                and at this point we don't have too much                                data about like revenue generated by the                                mobile sites we know we get more revenue                                per click but typically people click                                less or mobile so that's the only                                statistics I really can share here about                                mobile and what effect it has on our                                business                                very short us some specifics on the our                                 site it could be interested in these                                 kind of things we use one URL for both                                 mobile and desktop there's no real big                                 reason why we do that it's just very                                 transparent for the user so we chose                                 that way you cannot go wrong at this                                 point it's choosing two URLs either you                                 have some discussions in the SEO world                                 but you can choose we rely heavily on                                 akuma akuma is a h caching solution so                                 there's a very specific case where we                                 have to do a lot of mobile configuration                                 there so that's not really Drupal                                 related we have our own mobile team                                 where we do a lot of template overrides                                 really a lot so it's a video one-to-one                                 mapping of each mobile desktop page to a                                 mobile page and we get rid of as much as                                 possible that the default JavaScript CSS                                 and we gradually build a mobile sites                                 some pages are still not mobile friendly                                 so we just give it up                                 so these are like the highlight of we                                 build the sides I'm going to cover a lot                                 more things that our general Drupal that                                 are not covered by our sites yeah we                                 chose to make a mobile site first one of                                 the big reasons is just to reach it's                                 easy to get a lot of people that with                                 the browser we can easily tweet about                                 stuff and URLs open a browser URLs don't                                 open an app that easily so that's why we                                 definitely through the website first                                 also mail communication these and other                                 newsletters so the moments somebody                                 clicks on one of the links he goes to                                 the mobile site is very easy it can be a                                 reason why you choose a mobile websites                                 above a mobile app we are also building                                 a mobile app as like a complementary                                 strategy for some specific tasks and                                 interactions we're really going to                                 narrow down what our site does are we                                 going to think our towards the mobile                                 user doing what is it as essentially                                 it's mobile usage this will be very neat                                 kind of fun interaction                                 comparative complementary to the                                 so let's talk mobile and Drupal so the                                 difficult thing in preparing this kind                                 of presentations is there are many faces                                 to mobile and probably people have                                 different expectations on this                                 presentations do we had this morning                                 already in this room presentation                                 responsive design media queries I hope                                 you attended this session was very                                 interesting and I'm not going to cover                                 that if you really will expect this you                                 won't see it here there's a lot of                                 starbucks native versus browsers of                                 flying applications javascript                                 frameworks sense of touch the query are                                 very well-known cross-platform                                 development using phonegap celebrator so                                 i could you could create sessions about                                 each of these topics so i will try to                                 focus really on on views panels context                                 and some basic triples                                 so having all this facebook mobile of                                 course when you are start building                                 something mobile you need to have a                                 strategy so you cannot just say okay I'm                                 going to use JavaScript framework and                                 build on that or I'm going to want to                                 use iOS you really have to think very                                 well on what you want to build so simply                                 put you can ask yourself a couple of                                 questions just do you need to support                                 many devices low-end devices do you want                                 to be able to have people going to your                                 website from a Twitter or from an email                                 what are the technologies you use what                                 are your budgets do you want something                                 very graphical that swipes and it's                                 girls or is it really content driven                                 like CMS people navigate through lists                                 so yeah just have to define some kind of                                 strategy and from there you choose                                 technology can very simply put if you                                 just want to have this delicate iphone                                 app you want to revenue from these app                                 stores like you create a game you're                                 forcing think of iOS and Drupal services                                 cross-platform if you need a treat                                 maybe have a look at frameworks like ups                                 elevator phonegap and of course people                                 services browser-based you have                                 different requirements and if you're                                 wondering at this one side that goes to                                 our tablets and mobile phones you can                                 use responsive and let the adaptive                                 designs and this can be for example a                                 cheaper solution it's a                                 could be easier to maintain                                 so first think of these                                 once you have like the strategy drupal                                 comes into play later after you also                                 defined what the product should look                                 like and then there's these typical                                 steps I'm not going to discuss these                                 steps here but you know that you have to                                 make sure that is usable that you have                                 to have some special interaction design                                 and you have need dedicated people to                                 think about these things you have to                                 architect like a normal web sites                                 implement Anderson testing and                                 definitely testing for mobile is need                                 some specific knowledge on emulators                                 will device testing test banks because                                 there's so many devices you can test all                                 so what I'm trying to do here is just                                 talk a little bit more about this                                 discord Drupal components whenever you                                 you build a Drupal site you will use                                 vuze you will use context in my case I                                 often use views of use context it is                                 very easy extensions to to my modules i                                 use i tend to use panels now a lot for                                 mobile it has some nice features and of                                 course steaming layer can use a lot of                                 overrides caching is very specific in                                 Drupal and mobile and multi-site can                                 help too so yeah in the Drupal community                                 we all know Drupal is getting hot a lot                                 of sessions about mobile and drupal as                                 typical Denver as far as i know will                                 specifically a focus also                                 mainly what you will find within the                                 Drupal community in the modules are a                                 lot of device detection modules helping                                 you to detect is it a mobile device they                                 do it based on different parameters like                                 user agent strings is the second most                                 used one team switching whenever it is a                                 mobile device advanced redirection                                 schemes you always want to direct a                                 mobile user to the mobile site first but                                 you also want to allow the user to go                                 back to the desktop side so it gets a                                 full view so there's some stuff there                                 there to there are mobile themes there's                                 fusion mobile one I can definitely                                 recommend if you want to start building                                 mobile sites or you can just build from                                 scratch use them or adapt your own team                                 and there's a lot of integration with                                 these modules like context panels fuse                                 that are really driving a lot of the                                 development then they make Drupal easy                                 from time to time                                 another important distinction you have                                 to make when you start making mobile                                 site is on top do you want to make a                                 mobile version of your desktop sites                                 expect that this is a lot more complex                                 than just making a mobile only site                                 making mobile only sites it's more like                                 building a normal site you just make it                                 nice nice looking on mobile devices                                 damn it but the moment you have these                                 views you have these content types you                                 have these templates and a lot of tables                                 or concrete modules that use tables and                                 example a bit files you have to look                                 around you have to override and play it                                 so it's more work and can be a lot                                 sometimes kind of hacky if you have like                                 this all sides that are already provides                                 a lot of functionality                                 sometimes you see sighs that's use                                 fiction ality because there's a module                                 for it                                 an example are spaces and groups where                                 you can have the dashboard where                                 administrators can dynamically lay out                                 their websites once you want to have                                 this mobile it's really hard that's what                                 to say impossible within normal budgets                                 so when you have a basic ID you can                                 start architecture architecting your                                 sides so an easy architecture when you                                 want to create an application iphone app                                 android app or using javascript                                 framework your often end up with this                                 kind of simple architecture by you is                                 Drupal or and contract modules and you                                 use the services API in this                                 presentation also assume intermediate                                 levels so that services API is module as                                 a model helps you exposing functionality                                 of your websites in form of rest                                 services or xml RPC                                 like a second kind of website would be                                 for example a medium-sized nonprofit's                                 where you really focus on a big reach                                 you want to reach a lot of people                                 however it doesn't have to be very                                 mobile specific you really want to reach                                 a lot of people so that's when you just                                 where you can try to create your normal                                 websites I try to have an adaptive                                 responsive template like just serve                                 everything from one team                                 this is very simple                                 and then a more advanced configuration                                 could be aware for example product                                 company it's very important for a                                 product company that's when they provide                                 something a mobile it also looks good is                                 very user friendly so they have to take                                 into account the mobile user a lot so                                 there's where we typically them to                                 create two templates that's what we've                                 done in consumer search it's what I've                                 been implemented with a lot of clients                                 is trying to reuse one triple database                                 we use core contributor modules we try                                 to find a way where within mobile                                 templates you can direct a mobile user                                 so this is still very easy to set up and                                 you can manage to have a very good                                 mobile user experience however since you                                 have to compromise between desktop                                 mobile there are some trade-offs so it's                                 another mobile first approach so it's                                 sometimes usability can                                 we can be less good there                                 and then one of the use case we had was                                 a bigger Hospital there the case was                                 there was a lot of contents and they                                 also wanted a lot of mobile specific                                 functionality so they did not want to                                 one on one mapping for mobile desktop to                                 mobile but they really want to have two                                 strategies and that's where you can                                 consider a more advanced Drupal                                 architecture is where you say where you                                 use a multi-site approach meaning you                                 use two databases and you let me share                                 some part of the website mainly users                                 mainly contents you can maybe share                                 views or whatever but you try to split                                 out as much as much of the things                                                                                                        sharing some basic stuff so this is a                                 more advanced configuration in long term                                 it can help you to stay focus on your                                 mobile and desktop and not have the                                 problem where you have to force                                 something that you implement in your                                 desktop into your mobile                                 it's a bit harder to set up a meeting                                 so I guess this is kind of overview what                                 you can do with Drupal in terms of                                 architecture how you can split out                                 things answer                                 different devices                                 so                                 when you have these architectures is of                                 course all these modules you can use                                 context panels fuse go to steaming                                 layers basically they are you yeah                                 they're your friends enemies depends on                                 what you do and as an example I want to                                 go to some of these modules so                                 just a quick test who uses context                                 modules for their websites                                 it is still a kind of small group so our                                 context module is a a very popular                                 module that allows you to configure                                 parts of your site depending on certain                                 contexts are very easy and very often                                 used example is that you configure the                                 block layouts based on a path in your                                 URL meaning that you can for example                                 have a home page and you say on the home                                 page I want to have no blocks in the                                 sidebars and you have user page same                                 user pages i want to have certain other                                 blogs and on your                                 new space you can have a different                                 configuration can also configure                                 breadcrumbs so context helps you to                                 really lay out and configure your site                                 based on context so from how it sounds                                 you can use it to reconfigure sites                                 based on mobile complex or desktop                                 so when when you use a mobile tools                                 there's a plug in for contests that can                                 make your life a lot easier so we can                                 say okay I want to configure certain                                 contexts and based on that context I                                 want to have some specific reactions and                                 to keep it simple a reaction can be if                                 I'm on a mobile home page I don't want                                 to have any blogs I want a time                                 user page and I'm accessing on a mobile                                 device I want to have other blogs or                                 less blogs than if I'm going from a                                 desktop page                                 this is definitely a big help if you                                 want to configure mobile site                                 two other tips when you context module                                 for mobile is that you should work with                                 naming conventions for example if you're                                 again configure context for your                                 homepage you could name it this context                                 homepage and whenever you create a                                 mobile context you just prefix it with                                 mobile you can do the same with user                                 pages you create your normal desktop                                 user context and whenever you want to                                 have a mobile variant on that it's                                 recommended to prefix it with mobile                                 because there's a kind of simple reason                                 when other contexts for mobile start                                 with more prefix you can easily disable                                 your desktop context based on that's                                 requirements                                 and the reason we tend to do that is                                 often you start with a desktop site and                                 you have this desktop site with a lot of                                 Oh text and you don't want to be too too                                 intrusive on your existing desktop                                 contexts you want to reconfigure every                                 desktop context is saying only use this                                 context if it's a mobile                                 if it's not a mobile device that that's                                 why you can easily create a specific                                 role where you say whenever mobile                                 context as active saying it has this                                 prefix to it don't enable this decibel                                 context                                 for example when you have this rule and                                 mobile tools module falls out or someone                                 disables it it will not disable your                                 desktop context it will not show any                                 errors so it's like a progressive way of                                 start configuring your                                 so this is one of the ways where you can                                 really start we figuring really outing                                 your sites without having to go to my                                 too much you can create custom blocks                                 views blocks that you only enable in                                 this mobile context                                 so if you're going that route saying                                 okay I'm going to use context to                                 reconfigure my mobile sites there's one                                 big caveat which context is whenever you                                 start configuring your context you all                                 always get and you figure your blocks                                 you only get information of your default                                 Drupal team so that means if you have a                                 normal drupal team with a header or left                                 right content Twitter and you would have                                 a mobile site that says something like a                                 mobile header mobile top                                 mobile twitter it would be hard to                                 configure this with context chat i                                 created a plugin i'm going to commit to                                 the mobile to smuggle that's just easily                                 whenever you configure a region that has                                 mobile in the prefix until look which is                                 the mobile team little fetch these                                 regions so you can nicely configure your                                 blog space in the mobile                                 so that's something just to look out for                                 so a second module we often uses views                                 so often we we have the case where this                                 desktop site has a lot of views and                                 these views have certain parts so                                 there's always a question of k we want                                 to create a more mobile friendly                                 friendly view meaning we want less data                                 on the views we don't want it table                                 layouts but we really want to keep the                                 part so there's no ready way in triple                                 to just say okay I want to have a mobile                                 variants of the surgeon view whenever                                 there's a mobile device going to that                                 page show me different view                                 so for this                                 I experimented with creating a plugin to                                 the NS schematic to the mobile tools                                 module but you can just look at its code                                 and maybe use it at your own use and we                                 plugged into the access rules of use to                                 what happens with views you can like                                 what you see here is a difficult part of                                 abuse configuration and the left up you                                 see I created a mobile view and a                                 desktop view and these are two displays                                 of the same view                                 so now when you enable mobile tools and                                 you click access you can choose to say                                 okay I want to have restrictions based                                 on device you can say configure mobile                                 access settings and then you can also                                 say only mobile or desktop devices can                                 view this display of the view so what                                 happens when views encounters an access                                 to certain parts for example if I would                                 go to the overview path it will first                                 look at the mobile view the display                                 in another look at which devices                                 accessing at this view and if i would                                 have configured it's only mobile devices                                 you can see this view and i go there                                 with the desktop browser and it will say                                 ok there's no access to this view it                                 will just look at the next display                                 available that is the same part so this                                 way you can easily organize your views                                 you just make an alternative display of                                 the existing view you enable this axis                                 of it some kind of problem with few and                                 exercising is is that access settings                                 are not chainable meaning there are                                 different access plugins reviews that                                 could be enabled so they it's not easy                                 to make them work nicely together and                                 chain ok i want this view only to be                                 viewable by admins that are on a mobile                                 device                                 which is already been through a long way                                 and that thing what you have                                 so third module we often uses panels                                 same question who uses panels on their                                 sides                                 thirty-five percent of the room                                 it's a very short basic introduction to                                 panels probably too short to really                                 honor the module panels is one of this                                 very popular and important contract                                 modules are created by a mouse and we                                 all benefit a lot of that and it's                                 allows you to create kind of flexible                                 layouts on your Drupal sites think of a                                 newspaper site where you would say you                                 configure different regions and you                                 assign different contents to these                                 regions                                 so you can can really create flexible                                 layouts and one of the very powerful                                 things that panels also allow you is to                                 / app / rights how you display nodes so                                 typically when you display a node you                                 display title body whatever fields you                                 have you typically create a template for                                 it so when you use panels you can                                 overwrite a certain type of pages so                                 here you see when you go to panels you                                 immediately see this kind of block where                                 you say okay I want to overwrite no                                 template saying I want to reconfigure                                 how somebody sees no template                                 and again when you configure how this                                 notice being displayed panels allows you                                 to create variants so variants allow you                                 to create rules and each of these rules                                 kind of trigger which variant of this                                 panel you see that means you can create                                 a rule that says okay when I have a                                 mobile device accessing the site I want                                 to see the mobile variant of this panel                                 and this mobile variant can contain less                                 data or have different layouts come on                                 you have a desktop user going to decide                                 you can have companions com vehicle                                 figured that you just use the desktop                                 parents so                                 when you have panels you can reconfigure                                 a note when you have contacts enabled                                 you can reconfigure everything around                                 your notes when you have views you can                                 really override the default view you                                 have to this kind of three simple                                 plugins you can go a long way and                                 mobilizing your desktop site                                 so there's a just an example when you go                                 to a panels and you create a new rule we                                 can really say I want to have a rule                                 based on mobile browser or not and the                                 typo or you can really say I won't have                                 it on a specific user                                                    make no layouts based on iphone android                                 or iPads and other devices                                 whenever you do that you can just start                                 building your panel that you would do                                 before in choosing a out and in can                                 assign                                 we shorten and teaming one of the things                                 we do most is try to get rid of as much                                 CSS and JavaScript that's being                                 generated by a lot of the country                                 modules like Drupal core it's often a                                 struggle with cultured modules so always                                 be aware if you enable config modules                                 via rail which are quickly generate                                 often it they're less mobile friendly or                                 they're very JavaScript focused and                                 basically the rules try to create a                                 mobile separate mobile team there's of                                 course a camp saying okay create                                 adaptive responsive themes you can                                 always combine mobile teams with                                 adaptive responsiveness however whenever                                 you create an adaptive responsive team                                 be aware that whenever you change                                 something to you mobile for your mobile                                 user you're always prone to make errors                                 to the desktop view two of your team so                                 that's kind of caveat when you use this                                 kind of                                 and there's a lot of things to say about                                 that there have been covered this                                 morning so we'll go into much depth this                                 so another module we having Drupal                                 mobile tools so i wrote this two years                                 ago a little bit more than two years ago                                 it's kind of experimental way and what                                 can we do with drupal how can we make it                                 easier for developers so I put a bunch                                 of stuff in there so this is just the                                 big list can help you're doing a device                                 detection in Drupal it has plugins for                                 also Wuerffel to do more advanced the                                 text and browse cap it's also helpful                                 module that detects browsers it can help                                 you a device redirection if you choose                                 to have two URLs it will                                 redirect a request to the mobile URL if                                 needed the steam switching you can also                                 define groups of devices if you want to                                 have multiple teams for different device                                 groups you can to create mobile user                                 roles let's say if you have your site                                 heavily depends on user roles could also                                 make variants and whenever a user access                                 inside through mobile device it gets a                                 mobile variant of his usual you can                                 force full view mobile if you want to go                                 back you can cancel to custom home pages                                 hi scrollbars Heights address bars and                                 of course interface with build modes                                 something else you have in Drupal                                 context with panels and actually now                                 also with views so there's a lot of                                 things going on here                                 there's some configuration examples when                                 you are going to mobile tools it's very                                 straightforward you can just say ok when                                 do you want to switch teams you can say                                 I don't want to switch teams at all you                                 can say I want to switch teams for                                 whatever mobile user access to the sides                                 or you can also say I want to switch                                 teams purely based URL you can select a                                 team and there's some additional changes                                 that you can make for example I want to                                 automatically                                 I address bar and or you can add                                 specific errors for example you can set                                 the viewport size                                 worried about viewports by default                                 iphone has a report of actually                                     pixels so that means that an iphone                                 crisis look at                                                         if you have a mobile site that's                                     pixels wide actually we will see a                                 zoomed-out version of that site it's                                 very important that you set your view                                 reports with to the device width of your                                 device                                 and another smart thing you can do is                                 you can create web clips you need to                                 have a mobile websites somebody can                                 easily put the site to the front page                                 his mobile device                                 can also configure redirection you can                                 have different kind of schemes you can                                 choose to do it MDOT mobiles and your                                 mobile domain or just your mobile domain                                 or you can just give SS and you can also                                 it so you can put exceptions which pages                                 should redirect to a mobile site for                                 example if you are not ready to mobilise                                 values are your pages get certain                                 exceptions                                 something else that the module provides                                 us so if you go to the mobile site you                                 want to go back to the full sites and                                 you're on mobile device we need to set a                                 cookie so we force mobile toones to not                                 redirect your gun so you can choose how                                 long this cookie exists                                 and there's some not useful developer                                 tools so you can really force using this                                 query parameter to go to                                 so a caching                                 is a big issue currently when you talk                                 mobile and drupal the main reason it is                                 where you have a high-traffic site                                 caching typically happens outside of                                 drupal                                 same question who uses varnish for                                 caching                                 who uses Akamai for caching few who uses                                 core Drupal caching                                 and who doesn't use caching                                 nobody                                                                  which is in the fact that I caching                                 happens outside Drupal that means you                                 cannot use Drupal to do device detection                                 or redirection so first case if you do                                 drupal caching you are you're lucky                                 that's true Paul is still calling your                                 boots that means the module get still                                 intercept page requests and do something                                 doing something can be detected device                                 switch teams or redirect the user so                                 mobile tools                                 can work with drupal caching and it has                                 some example codes how you can really                                 interface deeply with caching using the                                 page get fast parts function this kind                                 of function is being used with all                                 getting by you all caching muggles it's                                 a method as being a called very early in                                 a good friend                                 second case a lot of high traffic sites                                 tend to use external caching like                                 varnish and echo mine it's actually what                                 happens is a page request first it goes                                 to akamai or varnish and then it looks                                 into the cache this page already                                 Requested or not and if so it's a guess                                 this page to catch so let's say if                                 you're in a configuration where you say                                 I share one URL for both mobile and                                 desktop and first a user comes from a                                 desa browser this page get cached next                                 user that visit the sites from a mobile                                 browser will get this desktop page out                                 of cash so you have to be very careful                                 and reconfigure your function like my                                 installation so they can detect the user                                 agent using a simple user agent met by                                 matching somebody uses boost for caching                                 so boost is a very powerful drupal                                 module boosts allows you to create                                 static files from your pages let's say                                 somebody visits your website anonymous                                 user whenever he visits when your page                                 is rendered this page is being stored as                                 a static file yogesh and next time a                                 user visits your sites where in apache                                 you can look does this static file                                 already exists and if so serve that                                 static file again the same problem here                                 drupal never gets to see the requests                                 when the page is being cached so                                 currently i'm building a kind of                                 solution for a patchy and drupal to work                                 wallet boosts so if you look for                                 examples for these scenarios and the                                 first scenario go to the mobile tools                                 module and read the readme file there is                                 a big example of how to hook into the                                 cache                                 and do some actual device detection and                                 change caching keys for varnish I have                                 an example on my blog it's too verbose                                 to just put on inside here typically it                                 will just attacked user agent string it                                 does some matching on this is an iPhone                                 device I Android device this symbian                                 device                                 and then redirect or change the dashiki                                 therefore boost our posted hopefully in                                 a couple of weeks is the same mechanism                                 and apache HD HD access file you're                                 going to do some simple a detection                                 so actually this is a real quick flight                                 to some of the core modules you have                                 Interpol to work with so if you have                                 context view panels you can create a                                 very flexible dynamic side with it so                                 you can easily reconfigured things to                                 provide a mobile view for that if you                                 need caching consider these strategies                                 very well before you start implementing                                 so no on a final note some some talk                                 about QA testing this is kind of a                                 general not really Drupal specific                                 so there are three points of testing                                 that you definitely have to consider                                 when when building this mobile site                                 first of all usability testing there is                                 not really my domain of expertise but we                                 all know you have to be have to create a                                 usual Xperia T experience you have to                                 have quick task completion the difficult                                 part is to the sphere target devices you                                 can keep it simple and just say I bill I                                 build an iphone website or an Android                                 site that's actually the route I'm                                 taking more and more just to make it                                 more easy for myself and just say okay                                 we're going to support some of these                                 high-end devices are we not going to                                 bother about for example symbian nokia                                 s                                                     Opera Mini or older BlackBerry's                                 libraries always a problem since so many                                 older blackberries are still in use and                                 they typically have very bad support for                                 JavaScript and then there's a                                 performance knowing that speech can vary                                 from                                                                     can deliver big values to holland mega                                 bits per second so there's a really big                                 range of speech you have there                                 to what I typically tend to do is before                                 every mobile projects try to really know                                 which devices like targets make sure                                 that there's no surprise at the end for                                 the clients when it come up with some                                 kind of strange device it's somebody in                                 the board as so always greatest nice                                 list of devices try to get some                                 properties of these devices screen                                 resolution support for JavaScript shows                                 us                                 runners corners phones replacements                                 media queries she always doing the                                 project you have a good few what you're                                 looking at                                 and different projects will have four                                 different lists                                 it's actually this is like a quick                                 flight to mobile Drupal core modules                                 yeah I would say I'm ending this early                                 it's the last session are there any                                 questions you can ask them here or just                                 come up to me after the session or                                 tomorrow hello thank you for the                                 presentation I was just wondering you                                 show us the show does the you know that                                 you can change direction for mobile and                                 desktop could you have different or else                                 for devices no iPad dot something dot                                 com yeah actually that's perfectly                                 possible quarantine mobile tools has                                 only URLs for mobile and desktop however                                 when you have a high traffic sides you                                 quickly start not you start stop using                                 mobile tools for the redirection                                 actually kind of sit forward in a                                 varnish and apache to create these                                 regular expressions where you say okay i                                 am now detecting tablets and I'm                                 redirecting to a different URL and when                                 you use it for example multi site setup                                 you can then react on on this URL                                 it's it's not possible to mobile tools                                 something you have to do within                                 your own module or maybe furnish                                 okay I have a question here I see that                                 many times people approach mobile sites                                 by doing device detection or OS                                 detection I see mobile tools have a                                 mixture of device detection and os                                 detection and the problem we're facing                                 often is that when new devices come out                                 with different screen sizes you have for                                 instance Android an Android device could                                 be a like on an iPad size or mobile                                 slice so have you worked anything with                                 feature detection instead of device                                 detection instead of saying we have a                                 separate a iphone version does this                                 device support a specific feature and                                 then we serve with page depending on the                                 feature have you worked anything with                                 that well that's a good question maybe I                                 should have put a slide on this there's                                 a big transition of methodology on this                                 part we're in the early days there was a                                 lot of effort and under still a lot of                                 effort and collecting this big list of                                 devices so you have this were full                                 library and it has thousands of devices                                 and then you try to detect even a                                 bachelor in Drupal okay which device is                                 accessing it and then you can even at                                 mobile tools allows you to do that to                                 you can group devices by saying I need                                 to have a certain screen size support                                 for JavaScript and support for the CSS                                 characteristics then I put it in group a                                 I can create a group be based on other                                 characteristics it's like one where you                                 can go and are some examples actually                                 also in the world for module for that                                 can create your own model where you                                 create some rules yeah and then the new                                 way                                 more and more we try to just support                                 these high-end devices Android iPhone                                 and a lot of feature detection you can                                 now just do with JavaScript for example                                 as a general location does it support                                 local local storage so more and more we                                 going away from this hardcore user agent                                 detection big databases but we're going                                 to use media queries responsive designs                                 that's a way of testing using javascript                                 detects what are the capabilities air so                                 this I give shifts yeah that would be                                 later part of your answer that was sort                                 of what I was looking for because                                 databases as war for needs to get                                 updated and so many devices come out so                                 quickly so you can't rely on something                                 like Wuerffel so yeah I was more looking                                 for maybe JavaScript detection or                                 something like that but I there are no                                 tools in Drupal today that solves that                                 or is it                                 yeah so is there any tools that support                                 javascript detection are there any work                                 done in the Drupal community what yeah                                 there is but I cannot recall what is                                 names so I'll should put it up but our                                 tools and more and more tools and                                 JavaScript frameworks are ready to help                                 you are in detecting and its really it's                                 a new thing and all these beta lists                                 anymore more questions                                 ok cool we still have fifteen minutes so                                 if you have questions there's our one                                 question there's a gentleman there                                 and you didn't talk much now about using                                 the services module which I consider                                 often times more sane option when doing                                 web apps or triple mobile what's your                                 opinion why do you integrate it as a                                 theme in group well so actually a here I                                 talked about views panels contexts                                 because with my goal of the present data                                 was a lot of people are confronted with                                 this desktop site that's already there                                 and I need to make it mobile and it can                                 get very insane actually because the                                 site website has a lot of you as a lot                                 of pages etc so if then these are the                                 tools you have however an ideal solution                                 for a developer would be to really                                 separate the data from this from tense                                 so if you have the chance saying okay I                                 have a drupal site i have this have all                                 my content there and i want to use a                                 different front-end framework I think                                 it's definitely the better solution if                                 you have the time and the support of the                                 whole team and you you don't get a                                 question and we need to mobilize the                                 sides so my take is whenever you you can                                 and try to use services then and                                 use a separate front end it allows you                                 also more to think mobile first and say                                 okay how does my mobile site looks like                                 and then designed them just start to                                 serve so it definitely i'm pro that kind                                 of solution but in some cases and a lot                                 of projects actually a lot of project                                 still need this separate template                                 approach and you know is there an                                 initiative going on as this developing                                 and separate framework for drupal                                 integrated web apps yeah actually there                                 are some initiatives targeted towards                                 the tithing accelerator and iphone that                                 are very specific to these kind of                                 platforms to provide interaction with                                 drupal and certain mechanisms                                 I think you should have a look at the                                  mobil group from time to time people                                  pour some of it some of their                                  initiatives there but basically when you                                  talk about accessing your sides to get                                  content login users great contents you                                  could basically do with what the service                                  module provides it provides you a way to                                  great nodes retrieve list retrieve views                                  so you can go a long way we just serve                                  this module and try to user the rest                                  server for example it works fine with                                  with JavaScript frameworks so I would                                  just say the tools that are there now                                  are very adequate to help you build                                  there's a question the content area                                  it's uh it's mobile mobile tools                                  becoming the sort of standard do you                                  think I playing devil's advocate here                                  I'm not that familiar with a try to set                                  up a mobile site a while back and I                                  realize there are a few different                                  alternatives he's mobile tools becoming                                  the kind of standard way that Drupal                                  will address this problem or are there                                  other tools around a reasonable good                                  answers for the same problem no it will                                  not become the standard way I think it's                                  too early to see standard way emerging                                  even in general in mobile development                                  see mobile tools as adult gets to do to                                  help you build this mobile site which a                                  standard way would be adaptive and                                  responsive designs consumer search where                                  I work for did not use mobile tools I                                  just took out some of the aspects it                                  really depends on that strategy and                                  that's why actually I put a lot of focus                                  in his first slides on think very well                                  why do you need because there's so many                                  options you have and like the last                                  question maybe a standard way would be                                  to just have triple as a CMS it's kind                                  of back end facing a platform where                                  editors or our content creators greater                                  contents your exposure to a service and                                  I guess so I more and more fun than                                  frame which also appear that allow you                                  to communicate with Drupal backends it's                                  it's too early and left me not to me                                  decide for me to say what's becoming                                  standards this has been around for two                                  years it's it helps but we definitely                                  explore more things                                  and being drupal as a content store is                                  definitely a route that should be                                  discussed more and group that's more for                                  the for the future                                  yet can publish the country or the                                  content alikes such as upload image or                                  the audio flowers through the mobile                                  phone so the question is what do you do                                  with media an adaptation of audio video                                  and images for video we try to rely on                                  providers of media storage and streaming                                  most providers have some detection and                                  stream the right media to you for images                                  I've worked most with image cache and                                  trying in my templates to use certain                                  presets of image cache so that's a way                                  to go there's also module called display                                  suit sweet and that's a modular session                                  was at the same time as this session                                  that's actually a module that allows you                                  to be very flexible with built modes and                                  actually built modes is a very core                                  functionality of Drupal that's whenever                                  you for example view nodes it's helped                                  to define which formatters you want to                                  use to display an image or less and text                                  and the spirits also allows you to plug                                  into mobile tools so where you can say                                  okay I want to have different for                                  matters for mobile devices for example I                                  want to have an image cache smaller                                  presets for certain mobile device and                                  that's only experiment I experimented                                  with this in Drupal                                                                                                                             can actually can use both different belt                                  modes but that's really specific for                                  where you have structured contents where                                  you have like in an image type in your                                  your content type then you can be fine                                  okay I want to have a mobile build modes                                  I'm not including this in the                                  presentation because it does not work                                  for Drupal                                                        advocate something that's not really                                  proven but if you want to test with that                                  I would say look at ms cash actually                                  there are also services like tiny dots                                  as RC dinosaurs and it's also a part of                                  actually the titanium accelerator                                  consortium so if you look up that time                                  titanium accelerator and dinosaurs at                                  the service where you can that transfer                                  your image on the fly depending on which                                  devices accessing its so that's the                                  second solution for this kind of test                                  quarters and dining source it's one of                                  the one I can think of                                  hi hi hi wondering how the d                                              mobile tools is coming along how is it d                                                                                                        version it's functional at this point I                                  don't have any plans to add more things                                  to the Drupal                                                          bug fixes and I'm deftly looking for                                  combing tenures maybe yeah maybe that's                                  a solicitation to commit Ain                                  yeah it's actually the stages of mobile                                  tools is grote I'm doing bug fixes to                                  mobile tools and I'm lacking a little                                  bit of time to really add new                                  functionality new features the last                                  thing I added was abuse integration two                                  months ago so this point I could use                                  help of people to submit patches and                                  even think of some new ID some new                                  implementations we can do but it can                                  even go as a radical as saying okay                                  maybe we should split out mobile tools                                  and more atomic chunks of code because                                  there are so many things in there                                  already I'm reluctant to put a lot of                                  new things into it                                  so feel free to contact me or talk to me                                  later and maybe have some ideas or if                                  you have an issue that's you want to see                                  Saul                                  more questions I think we have four                                  minutes left                                  I think that's enough if no one has a                                  question is I'd like to ask one how do                                  you use build modes with mobile tools so                                  that you can easily distinguish is there                                  a way to specify when using mobile tools                                  use this build mode yeah actually in                                  Drupal                                                                    not going to do the demo but when you go                                  to content types and you go to your                                  specific content type you can always                                  manage fields which one of the options                                  and also display and when you click                                  display you can see by default we have                                  built modes for search and you can say                                  which fields should go into search and                                  how this would go into search you have                                  one for RSS and then you have thinking                                                                                                          an extra tab they're saying mobile                                  mobile tools configuration page you can                                  we you have to enable it first says if                                  you do it drop of                                                      this extra extra build mode that's added                                  by the mobile much is not working for                                  Drupal                                                                   way to make this work because I used                                  build modes a little bits hackish to                                  make it make it
