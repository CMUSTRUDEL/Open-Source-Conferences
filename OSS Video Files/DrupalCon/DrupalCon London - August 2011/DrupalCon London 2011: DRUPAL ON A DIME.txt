You already know Drupal is capable of doing almost anything... for a price. But what about those looking to leverage Drupal on a tight budget and timeline? Is it possible to build a kick-butt site on a dime and deploy it at warp speed without sacrificing quality? (i.e. "Can I have my cake and eat it too?")

The goals of this session are threefold:

1. We will debunk some of the common myths about Drupal design and development. For example, we'll debunk the idea that custom built is always better.

2. Borrowing a page from Lean Manufacturing, we'll present a new way of thinking about web design and development that will allow you to achieve higher quality, at lower costs and record speeds.

3. We'll provide you with some practical tips for planning your next project. For example, "How do I decide what features I need?" and "How can I make the most efficient use of my designers time?"

Intended audience
This session is intended for people who are planning a project using Drupal and are looking for cost and time saving strategies.

Questions answered by this session
How can we make the most out of Drupal's functionality on a small budget?

What are some strategies and best practices for selecting features?

When is it wrong (and possibly unnecessary) to pay for custom development?

What can I do to get the most value from a web designer?

Low-price, high-quality, fast. I've heard you can only pick two, is that true?
