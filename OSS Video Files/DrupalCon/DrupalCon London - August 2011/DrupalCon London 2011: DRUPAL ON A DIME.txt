You already know Drupal is capable of doing almost anything... for a price. But what about those looking to leverage Drupal on a tight budget and timeline? Is it possible to build a kick-butt site on a dime and deploy it at warp speed without sacrificing quality? (i.e. "Can I have my cake and eat it too?")

The goals of this session are threefold:

1. We will debunk some of the common myths about Drupal design and development. For example, we'll debunk the idea that custom built is always better.

2. Borrowing a page from Lean Manufacturing, we'll present a new way of thinking about web design and development that will allow you to achieve higher quality, at lower costs and record speeds.

3. We'll provide you with some practical tips for planning your next project. For example, "How do I decide what features I need?" and "How can I make the most efficient use of my designers time?"

Intended audience
This session is intended for people who are planning a project using Drupal and are looking for cost and time saving strategies.

Questions answered by this session
How can we make the most out of Drupal's functionality on a small budget?

What are some strategies and best practices for selecting features?

When is it wrong (and possibly unnecessary) to pay for custom development?

What can I do to get the most value from a web designer?

Low-price, high-quality, fast. I've heard you can only pick two, is that true?

a little                               bit slow today so we hope this                               presentation goes okay so just to make                               sure you're in the right room we're                               talking about Drupal on a Dom today my                               name is Jennifer holes and this is Ben                               coder and just a little bit about who we                                are on the director of sales and                                marketing for a full service Drupal                                design and development agency and we're                                based in Vancouver Canada and my partner                                here Ben yeah my name is Vancouver and                                I'm the delete developer a diminish ex                                media and the CTO and transitioning in                                the role of CT okay um so basically we                                tried to focus these priests in this                                presentation on sort of two sets of                                people one would be if you're a designer                                / developer looking for strategies to                                build the drupal site cost saving time                                saving budget saving whatever and then                                the other is if you're actually a client                                interested in building a site with                                drupal and looking to kind of leverage                                those things as well we just get like a                                show of hands how many people here are                                kind of like in the designer developer                                camp and then other people are you from                                organizations potentially looking to use                                Drupal for your site's anybody like that                                here okay so nice mix of everybody and                                basically why we were here is just to                                kind of go over some of our experiences                                with helping clients build sites better                                cheap fast and good all together so                                where this all kind of started at our                                company the way that we started looking                                at new opportunities and new ways to                                take on kind of lower budget jobs was                                this was actually from a prospect that                                had contacted me and he said in looking                                for a developer I've found that there                                are an equal number of single person                                companies who cannot handle this                                as there are multi-person agencies who                                will not work for less than twenty                                thousand dollars unfortunately neither                                of these is the right fit for me as an                                agency we're about                                                      those are developers and a couple of                                years ago we said you know listen we                                can't take projects under $                                           the way that our team is set up it just                                proved to be too costly and budgets were                                getting run up because we were treating                                each individual project kind of like                                starting from scratch and working with                                that client to kind of I guess lean                                towards their needs versus trying to                                kind of instill and force upon them some                                strategies that could help them get what                                they want but at you know a good budget                                within a good time line at a at a good                                price so I don't know how many of you                                have read the oatmeal are you guys                                familiar with the oatmeal com so this is                                like one of my favorite comics from the                                oatmeal how web design goes straight to                                hell so it's kind of the idea where a                                prospect comes to you as me the sales                                person is I'm vetting out potentially                                taking on somebody's business you have a                                you know couple of calls or a couple of                                face-to-face meetings with the client                                and everything seems great you kind of                                outline their expectations and you you                                know collect your requirements and based                                on what they need you say yeah sure we                                can do it in X amount of price and then                                we find right from that moment on when                                it gets to the development stage all of                                a sudden all this other crap gets thrown                                into the next and soon you're finding                                your scope is getting out of line and                                your budget is getting out of line and                                your timelines you're getting pushed                                back so one of the things that we                                started doing with clients is a you know                                I am a unique snowflake I think you guys                                anybody who's designed and developed a                                website it's like somebody will come to                                you and be like no I've got the best                                idea it's like Facebook and YouTube and                                Twitter all rolled into one and it's                                totally unique and there's nothing like                                it out there so it has to be a total                                custom build no like that module sounds                                 great but I need it to do this this and                                 this                                 and that's kind of like the first stop                                 that we are putting on clients like                                 you're not a unique snowflake chances                                 are something's been done before how can                                 we take something that's been done                                 before and make it work for your unique                                 business needs to give you the most                                 value at your ridiculously low budget                                 that you've made us work with so again                                 fast cheap and good you're always                                 hearing you need to pick any two you                                 can't have all three so what's some of                                 the things that Ben's going to go into                                 in a minute is just talking about                                 strategies within the design and                                 development stage where you can get all                                 three so um you can't always get what                                 you want there are certain red flags                                 that usually come up right in the                                 beginning stage of projects that we do                                 we have with with the clients so we                                 wanted to share a couple of those with                                 you and also kind of like how to how to                                 approach these red flags if they come up                                 and and one of my absolute favorite that                                 sometimes comes up is that a client will                                 say to you well I want to switch to                                 Drupal I see all the benefits of using                                 Drupal and an open source CMS and all of                                 that but I want at my side at least                                 works the same way as my old system it                                 should look like my old system will have                                 the same functionality as my old system                                 so that is that is kind of like a first                                 red flag that that you really need to                                 address right away because if they want                                 to have something that is exactly like                                 the old system why do they want to                                 switch in the first place it doesn't                                 make sense this will create later on                                 just it will be more time consuming to                                 try to recreate and Drupal something                                 that was built for example over years as                                 a custom PHP system and easily you can                                 easily run out of budget if you're                                 trying to if you're going along with a                                 client there that has that expectation                                 and actually also a little bit further                                 on to that today at twelve-thirty                                 there's also another                                 presentation called I'm leaving you the                                 risk of dumping your CMS for Drupal how                                 do you manage them so if you're if                                 you're someone who actually is thinking                                 about doing that switching from your old                                 CMS system to to Drupal that might be                                 also a presentation that is really                                 interesting for you the thing to keep in                                 mind and to really make sure that the                                 client is getting that is that every CMS                                 doesn't matter if it's Drupal or                                 WordPress or Joomla or if it's something                                 proprietary it has its idiosyncrasies it                                 works it's it's certain ways it has its                                 strong points and it has its weak areas                                 and Drupal might be a little bit plain                                 out of the box but y'all are aware of                                 like the the multitude of modules that                                 are provided by the by the community and                                 that are out there so again thinking                                 about that concept of I'm a unique                                 snowflake which is not true chances are                                 that someone already has built something                                 that addresses your needs or your                                 clients needs now will that solution                                 that is already built fit a hundred                                 percent to the requirements that you                                 have now well chances are that this will                                 not be the case but I don't know if                                 you're familiar with the                                                you can get about eighty percent of your                                 requirements done for twenty percent of                                 the of you of your budget if you think                                 about that then this is a really good                                 starting point with the with the project                                 so the idea would be to reuse already                                 contributed modules instead of recreate                                 modules or recreate functionality just                                 because there's one little piece that is                                 okay we're trying to come up we where                                 you think sorry sorry about that is that                                 is that any better okay sorry um now                                 where was I yeah so the idea of reusing                                 functionality modules that have been                                 already a built that are already out                                 there instead of recreating something                                 completely new just because it's there's                                 this tiny little bit that is not how you                                 envisioned it to work and I'm also going                                 to go into that a little bit later as                                 well another red flag that sometimes                                 comes up during the initial discovery is                                 if someone is saying well i would like                                 to my site to look or work like amazon                                 or or facebook well if you're on a tight                                 budget that's probably not possible and                                 it's really important to make clear that                                 these sites haven't been built within                                 like one project phase over like two or                                 three months these sites have grown over                                 years and years and have improved over                                 years and years so that is something to                                 keep in mind and also other things that                                 sometimes clients liked you to slip by a                                 little bit on on the side is where we                                 have this little in health system that                                 we use and we just need to to have like                                 a little connection to the to the drupal                                 side but it's nothing big it's pretty                                 easy it's just to see as we file and in                                 the end it's it's turning out into like                                 a full-on live connection to their ms                                 access machine that they have sitting                                 somewhere without an internet connection                                 in their in their office so those are                                 things that you really you need to kind                                 of like make sure to iron that out and                                 to make clear that it might sound simple                                 but to make sure that your client knows                                 that I know this is actually way more                                 difficult than then what you what you                                 had in mind also another one that we                                 hear from time to time is that someone                                 is saying what we want decide to                                 basically manage our day-to-day business                                 front so it shouldn't be just like a                                 website that shows information it                                 also should also completely handle all                                 our business on on the backhand side so                                 if you hear something like that and                                 they're coming to you and say well we                                 only have twenty thousand dollars then                                 you might have to talk with them about                                 their expectations that they have                                 regarding that but coming again also to                                 the                                                                 slide here you just might find what you                                 need so a client might have the great                                 expectations of how things should work                                 might not be familiar with the with how                                 Drupal works and and some of the ways                                 that Drupal does things but it is                                 important to help the client to                                 understand like well you know what give                                 it a try this is what we can do within                                 the budget that within the timeline that                                 we have so have a look at it because                                 even though it's not exactly what you                                 envisioned it might be exactly what the                                 people that work on a day-to-day basis                                 really like or that this is actually                                 really the thing that they would that                                 they will find beneficial so I put this                                 slide up because I think it's really                                 hilarious when I want a web project get                                 started and you kind of pick out your                                 your point person in the in the company                                 that you're working with who acts as                                 their project manager working alongside                                 our project manager and then things like                                 I a mock ups look wireframes or design                                 mockups or as we're in agile development                                 doing sprints we're having things tested                                 all of a sudden these other voices start                                 coming into the mix and before you know                                 it like everyone has got their own                                 opinion of how things should work and                                 you've already discussed the                                 requirements with the with the client                                 and outlined them but now that they've                                 passed it around to more people in their                                 organization they're coming back with                                 more and more requirements that are just                                 blowing the scope out of the water and                                 no word of a lie we actually had a                                 client who said he just wanted to show                                 the design to his sister because his                                 sister did design in a magazine like                                    years ago so he should have some input                                 to like what this looks like and she                                 came back with a whole bunch of little                                 changes etc etc where it's like go ahead                                 and collect that list of requirements                                 but table that and have the one point                                 person and try and keep as few people as                                 few key people involved in the project                                 as possible rather than sending it out                                 to the whole company for feedback so a                                 couple of key departments are the people                                 that should be representing the new site                                 and getting a prototype out they're                                 built to kind of get people playing with                                 rather than everybody saying oh well if                                 it just did this if just did that                                 leading the scope and budget creep and                                 further to what Ben was saying about a                                 site like Amazon rome wasn't built in a                                 day you find clients that when you we                                 were in the past a few years ago we were                                 taking a waterfall approach to project                                 so we're taking on projects anywhere                                 between fifty and a hundred and fifty                                 thousand dollars and then the                                 requirements just started growing and                                 growing and when a project is that big                                 and it takes like six months to a year                                 to complete your finding that by the                                 time that six months comes around that                                 their business or maybe even their                                 requirements have changed now you've                                 spent all this time building something                                 that may not even necessarily be                                 relevant anymore so we've really got                                 obviously we've embraced agile                                 development like I'm sure most of you in                                 the room have as well and we really                                 encourage clients even if budgets not an                                 issue to prototype small things and                                 explain to them they're kind of going to                                 get a more vanilla version but they're                                 going to be able to get their hands in                                 and test and like Ben said be able to                                 figure out Drupal a little bit more and                                 figure out what they like and don't like                                 and then sort of add those Lego blocks                                 in rather than building this big Lego                                 castle and handing it over and it might                                 not even be relevant to the client by                                 the time that it's done so the idea                                 they're just you know prototype and                                 build upon the smaller thing that you                                 started with and I'll start off with                                 this one and then pass it back to bend                                 but you know the proof is in that is in                                 the pudding everybody in a company when                                 you when you're working with a with a                                 site and when you're working with your                                 business you have so                                 of an inside intricate knowledge of                                 everything that you're doing but you                                 start to forget what the people who are                                 actually using your site are using it                                 for so our thing that we're always                                 trying to push on clients rather than                                 try and get a million requirements or                                 features functionality different design                                 things social media etc start with                                 something small and then get feedback                                 and you know spend the budget where that                                 feedback has come so your site makes the                                 most sense to the people that use it and                                 again if we think about for example                                 Google Google started out as a search                                 engine and not started out as a reply as                                 an online replacement for microsoft                                 office so things like that have                                 developed over over years and years and                                 just wanted to mention like two                                 real-life examples where where it makes                                 sense to to break it down into these                                 stories and into these different phases                                 and really look at what is really                                 important in the beginning for your                                 client or for your company so imagine                                 the requirement well if I if I poster if                                 I publish a new blog post I want this to                                 be sent out to to Twitter and on the                                 Facebook page and on Google+ which is a                                 valid requirement and there are modules                                 out there that will help you to to do                                 exactly that it's not a big issue but if                                 your client or your company don't even                                 have a Facebook account yet or a Twitter                                 account yet or working with Google Plus                                 this might be something those might be                                 like five to ten hours that actually                                 would be better spent on something                                 different the ability with Drupal is                                 there that's an that's the nice thing                                 and that's the thing that needs to be                                 made clear the ability to do that is                                 there but is this really the most                                 important part that we have just because                                 it is really fancy and you would like to                                 to have that as a feature or is that                                 something that can be put a little bit                                 on the side and in the end if there's no                                 budget left or maybe in the next phase                                 is this can be used another point also                                 regarding prototyping and and regarding                                 the the other slide that we had with you                                 might not get what you want is content                                 workflow adrees mentioned the workbench                                 module for drupal                                                    it's really nice addition and really                                 powerful but your client or your company                                 might have a very complicated workflow                                 about like who should be an editor of a                                 node and who can prove if that note goes                                 live and and how about then revisions                                 and and all of that so that might be                                 really complicated in your case and you                                 might not be able to absolutely                                 replicate that one to one with the with                                 the workbench module so prototyping in                                 this way would be that you trying to get                                 as close as possible to that required                                 workflow with a module like workbench                                 and then you let the client go in and                                 you say like okay here's here's a                                 prototype and we set up the workbench                                 module and all the support modules in a                                 way that we that we think is as close as                                 to what your company is doing and then                                 actually that the people that need to do                                 the approvals that need to do the                                 reviews let them have a week or so to                                 play around with and see how it works                                 see how the workbench module is                                 approaching things and again then you                                 might actually find that people come                                 back and say like this is absolutely                                 horrible this is not working for us at                                 all okay then you can address that or                                 they might say this is great this is                                 actually exactly what we need and in                                 reality some of the approval process is                                 actually not happening online and                                 there's no need to have that approval                                 process online because that approval                                 process is happening offline so this is                                 kind of like the also again the                                      approach and trying to break down these                                 the big picture into the smaller little                                 pieces that can be achieved easier and                                 again might be something that your new                                 client actually likes the already the                                 way it is                                 and how money and time can be saved so a                                 different up a couple of different                                 options that you can go as a company or                                 as a as a development shop as a                                 developer so how can you how can you                                 achieve that to to be really cost                                 effective here and the nice thing about                                 Drupal there are a lot of different                                 options in different ways how you can                                 save time and money the first one that                                 we wanted to highlight as an example are                                 you could use fully hosted solutions and                                 we just have two examples here there                                 there are a couple more out there that                                 you could use something like sub hub or                                 Drupal Gardens so this is a great way to                                 to get your feet wet if you want to try                                 out drupal in a really easy way it is                                 set up within minutes depending on which                                 package you choose it's also it's also                                 free you might find some unique features                                 in these in these products if you have a                                 Drupal garden side you might have played                                 around with the theme builder there                                 which is pretty nice and if you had a                                 chance to look at sub hub for example                                 they did an amazing job when it comes to                                 UI improvements and really making                                 something trivial like placing a block                                 applock really easy and intuitive and                                 using that also brings the advantage                                 that you have hosting and support                                 included in the different packages that                                 they offer so for smaller projects that                                 might be the way for your organization                                 to start off with and at any time you                                 can also take these your site's away                                 from these providers if you want to grow                                 later on now this is also going a little                                 bit into like the concept we have listed                                 here limited to the features provided by                                 the service well it might be that that                                 already has everything that you that you                                 need but if you want to have                                 at other modules it is possible in some                                 of the services or if you want to have                                 custom development attitude sub hub for                                 example then offers that that as a paid                                 service to to continue to develop your                                 site for you but then you also have to                                 keep in mind that when you move the                                 sides away from those service providers                                 you might lose some of the features so                                 for example if you don't if you have                                 downloaded a Drupal garden site and uses                                 locally you will find that the that the                                 theme builder for example is its is lost                                 all right you don't have that anymore                                 one other solution our Drupal                                 distributions there are ton out there                                 and they're really nice ones open public                                 drupal commons atrium these are all                                 solutions that you have that have a ton                                 of features they might already have more                                 features than you will ever need for                                 your organization or for your client                                 even to the point where you would need                                 to disable some of those features                                 they're right there for you to download                                 they're easy to install they all come                                 with the hole and install profiles                                 there's training and support and                                 documentation usually provided on the                                 company's web sites that provide those                                 distributions and as it is basically a                                 Drupal installation that you have full                                 control over you have also full control                                 over extending these features and adding                                 your own modules or adding any custom                                 development that you need later on but                                 if you're looking from a from an                                 organization that is looking for a                                 Drupal website on the on the con side                                 you have of course have that you need                                 someone who knows how to set up like a                                 hosting for example how to install                                 Drupal so it's it's not just a one-click                                 thing like with the fully hosted                                 services and in some of those some of                                 these distributions you have a bit of a                                 steeper learning curve in order to to                                 get things done so that is also a really                                 good solution                                 not only for developers or development                                 companies but also for organizations                                 that look to use Drupal to look at the                                 distributions that are available out                                 there and use those as a starting point                                 for your project and see what you can                                 already leverage there and what has                                 already been created there for you and                                 use that for your project but then                                 another thing also to to mention for                                 developers and development shops is                                 again to think about what we said before                                 and not to try to recreate reuse things                                 and don't recreate things so if you                                 build functionality for for your clients                                 think about if you can put that into                                 into a feature and set up maybe your own                                 feature server which is stunned really                                 easily keep your features that you                                 create for yourself so that you can in                                 the end we use it so that is for example                                 something that we had image X media have                                 started to Jenny mentioned a couple of                                 years ago that we said well we're                                 building that that news news and events                                 sites over and over again for for our                                 clients right so how can we make that                                 more cost-efficient how can we make that                                 quicker it's like okay well you know                                 what let's let's build a feature that                                 has all the views and all the content                                 types in it that we that we reuse all                                 the time and then if it's if it's                                 necessary we will adjust that for that                                 specific client but that is something to                                 keep in mind use tools like features                                 like strong arm in order to to create to                                 build up your own repository there are                                 also features available on drupal.org so                                 you also can give those features back if                                 you see fit or use some of the features                                 that are already out there and created                                 in order to cut down the cost for                                 yourself and for your client and I mean                                 that's basically how we got to a place                                 where we                                 do fast and sorry I can everybody hear                                 me that's basically where we got to a                                 place where we could do fast cheap and                                 good in essence what Ben was referring                                 to at our company image X we created                                 sort of like a Chinese menu base where                                 we had the same clients or different                                 clients asking us repeatedly for the                                 same things knowing that within each of                                 these clients that they have specific                                 requirements that they always want                                 tailored and you know going back to the                                 unique snowflake will know it has to be                                 like this but if we can take them what                                 we've built and kind of hand hold them                                 and you know from our point of view push                                 them into using stuff that is already in                                 existence they can have this they can                                 leverage what at one point cost us a lot                                 of money to build and is actually you                                 know quality features and                                 functionalities and sites but for a                                 fraction of the cost if they're willing                                 to stay in line with our kind of Chinese                                 menu of options and in doing so we found                                 that now we don't have to we stayed away                                 in the past from taking on these                                                                                                                 them a nightmare because we're always                                 doing these things we're allowing them                                 to push us into building stuff that was                                 uniquely for them which just obviously                                 isn't feasible within that kind of a                                 budget but once we started with this I                                 XM base and kind of pushing clients in                                 the opposite direction it's actually                                 added a decent revenue stream for our                                 company and filled in pockets of you                                 know capacity and development time                                 because our developers can pump this                                 stuff at with their eyes closed because                                 most of the work has been done we're                                 just slightly altering it for the client                                 but then hand holding the client to say                                 listen it can do this this and this but                                 you can't get it this way for the money                                 that you have but get something out get                                 it tested get feedback and decide where                                 it makes the most sense to spend the                                 money and if the requirements that you                                 thought were really important to your                                 business actually are providing business                                 value based on real life feedback what                                 did you think that's it okay                                 yeah i mean i think the with drupal the                                 answer is always you know can it do this                                 or kind of do that well sure it can do                                 anything you want like how much money                                 and how much time do you have and then                                 that's when you get the answer of like                                 well i have                                                         weeks and then that's when you got to                                 get realistic and say for                                             weeks here's the things that we can do                                 for you so you're definitely juggling                                 between different clients personalities                                 and for some people that might not be                                 the right fit a client will be like well                                 you're gonna do it exactly how I wanted                                 I'll go somewhere else but more often                                 than not we'll find those clients will                                 come back in the end and realize that                                 like no one's going to do what they want                                 or if somebody says they're going to do                                 what they want within their budget                                 they've made a grave mistake and will                                 regret it later so you're definitely                                 changing profiles depending on you know                                 the customers particular personality and                                 requirements                                 don't answer that um yes it's sometimes                                 it is an issue the the important thing                                 is to really to really have that clear                                 with uh with a client beforehand kind of                                 like and really explain them what the                                 agile approach means if you have these                                 smaller projects sometimes you will not                                 get around like to do kind of like a                                 hybrid solution where you kind of like                                 agreeing to to a fixed price but you do                                 a bit of an agile approach as in like                                 okay this is the fixed price so this is                                 the limit that we're working in now                                 let's break your requirements into all                                 the little stories and prioritize them                                 and then that's let's go through and you                                 see how much time we spend and how                                 things are progressing and and after                                 your first Sprint or so the client has a                                 product that he can work with and maybe                                 he's changing things a little bit but                                 then you need to also make clear to the                                 client is like okay you know what we                                 will let you know once we are reaching                                 ninety percent of our agreed time so                                 we're reaching the end of what we what                                 we can do with within that within that                                 limit so sometimes that is it is a bit                                 tricky but sometimes you can write need                                 to try a yeah mixed approach there I                                 think something we also try and do when                                 we're estimating to give clients an idea                                 instead of I mean we'll break things the                                 way that we work is we'll break things                                 down by line items and show a client                                 like how much you know time is being                                 spent on each particular feature and                                 requirement but another thing that we                                 try and do especially when somebody has                                 a lack of drupal knowledge is we add a                                 column that says you know percentage of                                 core functionality or you know like                                 existing module functionality so                                 something that in their head seems like                                 a really minor requirement could be like                                 well that's only thirty percent core                                 Drupal functionality so what you're                                 asking for is going to require seventy                                 percent customization and                                 that gives them a better idea in their                                 head where the biggest you know Tom                                 sinks of the project are going and we                                 found that's been really helpful to show                                 people in so many clients just think                                 that the things that they're asking for                                 are so little and meaningless why can't                                 they just be done I just I just want to                                 like write text in line no big deal you                                 know whatever if the requirement is and                                 then when we show them while listen this                                 is how Drupal works and what you're                                 asking is moving X percentage away from                                 the core but here's what the core does                                 what can we do within the core or within                                 the contributed modules that's going to                                 get close enough or you know maybe even                                 extremely close to what you want to do                                 if you're just willing to back off of a                                 few custom things                                 generally with five assumptions point                                 mass which is going to be gone how do                                 you on earth early on because to be the                                 same fades that                                 I mean it's a bit more difficult in a in                                 us in a smaller budget to do a proper                                 discovery phase but if we don't have the                                 time typically we'll set it aside                                 anywhere from                                                           discovery that's typically for larger                                 projects but if you say have a                                          k budget we'll do our best to understand                                 your requirements but what we really try                                 and do is outline in writing all the                                 things it will not do so you know they                                 have a requirement i don't know like I I                                 want social media on their site and to                                 us you know if we don't dig deep into                                 that it's like okay we can just throw up                                 links to Twitter and Facebook but then                                 it later on they'll take that and be                                 like no I wanted feeds I want it you                                 know like dynamically displayed on these                                 pages etc etc so we'll say okay social                                 media does not do this this this this                                 this but will do this so really making                                 you know a point to I mean in sales it's                                 like get everything in writing up front                                 because like you said assumptions will                                 be you know misunderstood between the                                 client and the person building the site                                 so we try and actively outline what the                                 things are that it will not do and that                                 I think helps us stay out of trouble and                                 a lot of in a lot of projects where a                                 requirement that you think is simple can                                 all of a sudden become really ambiguous                                 and complicated                                 so what we've created which we've sort                                 of dubbed internally as launch kit that                                 we're hoping to we haven't decided yet                                 if we're going to do like a distribution                                 or software of a service with it but                                 right now it's kind of IX and bass are x                                 times too short for image image x media                                 we find that that's kind of like a                                 combination of the sub hub and the                                 drupal gardens but i mean that brings                                 about an interesting point in certain                                 situations when it's a simple site like                                 let's say some kind of brochure site but                                 maybe with some like an events calendar                                 and a blog or something we'll just build                                 it on drupal gardens and like not if                                 it's going to be more of a hassle to                                 explain what Drupal Gardens is to the                                 client and sell them on the benefits of                                 Drupal we'll just build it on triple                                 gardens and they're none the wiser and                                 we've created them a site that they                                 think is beautiful that is here                                 mm-hmm I mean we've oh yeah sure um do                                 you want me to go ahead and repeat it                                 for you she was she was asking saying                                 that as a project manager she finds it                                 difficult when a when a client pushes                                 back if she were to say well no we're                                 not going to do that that that would                                 create animosity and potentially throw                                 the project off and I'm not a project                                 manager on the sales person but like I                                 find with an upfront contract so first                                 of all some of the things that we just                                 mentioned about what it is that you're                                 delivering and what it's it's almost                                 more important to say what it's not                                 going to do versus what it is going to                                 do because those are the things that you                                 can point back to the client and say we                                 told you it's not going to do this we                                 can do that but it's not in scope but we                                 as a company have went through a fair                                 amount of I'd say project manager                                 turnover and we really realized we                                 needed people in the roles with the                                 strong personality and reminding clients                                 that in coming to us you you know you                                 you sought us out because you said you                                 wanted drupal experts and the advice                                 that we're giving you isn't because                                 we're trying to you know save us money                                 or screw you out of giving you something                                 but we're we're trying to give you the                                 best advice possible for your budget                                 what you're trying to build for you know                                 business value priorities we want the                                 freedom and and we seek out clients that                                 if they come to us with a really                                 something that we think is a really                                 terrible idea that's a flag for us and                                 then we say I don't know that unless                                 you're willing to back off of this and                                 maybe start small whatever you know when                                 people how many people I'm sure tons of                                 you get like Facebook requests but                                 slightly different but totally unique                                 and it's going to be the next big thing                                 and that's just a flag and I think that                                 leads to more problems than if you're                                 clearly outlining things prior it's like                                 setting setting up like a communications                                 standard before the project begins and                                 then reminding client constantly                                 throughout the process I think helps                                 helps get out of trouble but definitely                                 a client wall in our experience                                 it's well it's like with anything if you                                 think you can get away with something                                 you're going to try and as a project                                 manager we've seen in our projects if                                 you cave to one thing that opens the                                 floodgates for way more things getting                                 getting out of whack with scope and and                                 budget I remember one time where we made                                 the mistake it was a it was a bigger                                 project but we were sitting in with a                                 client and they were kind of like oh and                                 we would like to have this and this and                                 we were like well okay it's it's a                                 larger project it's probably not going                                 to be that much issue with the with the                                 budget and we said because it was as                                 part of the discovery phase and they                                 there was one idea after the other and                                 we were just writing it down and then we                                 sent the revised estimate and they were                                 like what what what happened what                                 happened here how wide is it all of a                                 sudden like went up like                                               and we spoke with the client and we                                 explained it and and the kind was saying                                 why did you why didn't you tell me right                                 in that meeting that what I'm asking is                                 so far out from what Drupal core and                                 contributed module are doing because if                                 you would have set that in that meeting                                 I would have backed off so we find that                                 you need to in in the conversations with                                 a client to say mess with the putting in                                 a percentage of like how much can be                                 achieved of this functionality with                                 contributed modules and Drupal core                                 really gives declined a good idea of                                 like where do i add like really                                 extremely complicated things to the to                                 the whole package and and we really                                 learn from that experience to to push                                 back right away at the beginning and                                 saying you know it's not impossible but                                 what you're just asking here just                                 increased your budget properly by                                        yeah and I think that was an instance                                 where like the client literally said to                                 you like I'm i just paid you to do this                                 discovery because you know you're the                                 experts and you he wasn't being mean                                 about it but he said you know you wasted                                 my time going down the list of these                                 requirements when you knew this was                                 going to expand the scope by two to four                                 hundred                                 hours you know you wasted your time                                 scoping out everything for something                                 that we just don't have another you know                                 seventy five thousand dollars to add for                                 one feature on the site did everybody                                 hear that question or should I should I                                 repeat it what's that oh yeah so you're                                 asking if a client has a secret budget                                 and you want to know whether you should                                 bid high or low if it's fixed so if you                                 bid too low you would potentially get                                 yourself into trouble because it's fixed                                 but if you've been to high you might                                 price yourself out we try and stay away                                 from fix budgets would be my first thing                                 and we're not against doing fixed                                 budgets but if a client really harps on                                 us to do a fixed budget will say we'll                                 take it time than materials and then                                 we'll like multiply it a couple of times                                 because we're going to pat ourselves you                                 know to protect ourselves but from a                                 sales perspective I would bid low but                                 with the caveat of forcing them to do a                                 discovery which i think is is absolutely                                 necessary in a in a fixed bid project                                 yeah like lowball but then with like                                 giant cavy it's all around it saying                                 like this could go up once we go in but                                 I mean that's kind of that's kind of                                 folly and it's in its own right like I                                 don't like playing the games of the                                 secret budget because that signals the                                 client that is prey shopping like for a                                 kamata me yeah like they                                 like and in understanding that in                                 business if you're in a slow time you                                 might have to potentially take on a job                                 but right there that's a flag where                                 someone's being at least try and get                                 ranges out of climate so I'm like it can                                 be super broad but you know like if                                 someone won't won't share a budget of                                 any kind and then so within within like                                 so this is like a government type bed                                 right so are they are they making you                                 sign off on that bid once you've                                 submitted it saying yeah like that to me                                 is like giant red flag like especially                                 because I find governments are they'll                                 take an RFP for something that wasn't                                 web related at all and just change like                                 building a shed into like replacing that                                 with like web design just because                                 they're working off of standard                                 templates and we we got ourselves into a                                 lot of trouble with a city project in                                 the US same thing where we had to sign                                 off on the bed and they had a clear set                                 of requirements but then once the                                 project started it just got ballooned                                 out of the water and we had to we had to                                 sever the relationship at a at a penalty                                 but that's that's the tough one and you                                 know our stances an agency is we won't                                 even submit to something like that                                 unless we've got gaps in capacity I                                 don't think I have like a right a right                                 answer for you on on that one because it                                 is it is a tough one did you                                 just just our size one second sir well                                 it applies to like in software you can                                 typically get eighty percent of what you                                 need for twenty percent of the effort or                                 the budget to build so if you looked at                                 something or you're getting eighty                                 percent of what you need and the other                                 twenty percent is irrelevant so if you                                 took like Microsoft Word for instance it                                 has like ten thousand features but                                 you're probably only ever going to use                                 twenty percent of them where the other                                 eighty percent aren't important it's                                 called the what is it the Pathet the                                 Pathet oh well the question was to do                                 repeat kind of like the idea behind the                                                                           okay if I got the question right so how                                 to manage payment milestones in order to                                 show the client to progress in the                                 project yeah so I'd say ninety percent                                  of our projects or time and materials                                  and we have a time report system that                                  the client has                                                           sounds a bit vigilant but we tracked by                                  the minute and our developers are                                  required to give a description of what                                  they've done within that time and then                                  we're typically invoicing clients on a                                  bi-weekly or a monthly basis depending                                  how quickly the the project is                                  progressing so the clients getting a                                  really detailed summary of everything                                  that's been done so even if within a one                                  to two weeks print they might not have                                  something that seems tangible that they                                  can get their hands on and really get                                  into they're seeing where each minute of                                  work is going and the status of where                                  that particular feature is within the                                  development cycle that that answer your                                  question                                  Oh                                  um our developers do get stuck I'm sure                                  like everybody else I think if if we if                                  it's if it's within scope and we said we                                  could do it and then the developer gets                                  stuck we won't charge for it we call                                  that we would have our developers file                                  that under resolution so the client                                  would never see where those our like                                  wouldn't see those hours but if it is                                  something that the client has popped in                                  as a new requirement and research would                                  potentially be required to figure out a                                  solution that is typically something                                  we'd bill for unless we knew it would                                  take like kind of half an hour of going                                  to drupal.org and finding an appropriate                                  module or what have you and and also                                  regarding that it because the because                                  our clients have this the ability to see                                  where the where the time is spent one of                                  the important things and in the                                  beginning of working with them is that                                  we also let them know like okay if you                                  expect five hours spent on on this item                                  and let's say                                                           could be that the developer is a little                                  bit quicker with this item and but the                                  time saved here is spent on another one                                  that in the end is a little bit more                                  complicated than initially initially                                  thought but if it if it really is to the                                  to the point where where it is because a                                  developer doesn't know any any further                                  and no one else can and requires quite a                                  bit of time then that would become the                                  largest as non billable so the client                                  wouldn't wouldn't get those hours                                  and so he said here you're not doing                                  fixed budgets or you have to don't like                                  to do things budgets are you having to                                  clients without these parties                                  estimate the hours                                  No                                                                       if we to estimate but then at the end                                  okay so the question is regarding if a                                  client comes and they don't necessarily                                  have a budget they just put in the                                  requirements and then they want to know                                  how much that cost usually what we what                                  we do there is we give them we try to to                                  get as much information as possible                                  beforehand before we get back with and                                  with an estimate and then usually also                                  what we have is a is a low medium and                                  high number what we think the different                                  functionalities that they requested will                                  will be so that they get an idea of once                                  we get into a discovery phase with a                                  client like that we always would say                                  like hey let's do a discovery phase even                                  afterwards in order to make sure that                                  we're all on the same page but then we                                  would say like okay if this is really if                                  we understood you right and everything                                  is going fine and we can use module a                                  and B for this this will take                                           but if it turns out that there is a                                  little bit complication in there because                                  it needs to work together with a                                  different module and we might need to do                                  some custom work there this easily could                                  be                                                                      low and high range that they have right                                  away and to get a better idea of where                                  the risks lie in the different line                                  items that they have and if you have                                  this along with the with the percentage                                  that you that you think you can handle                                  that with Drupal core without custom                                  development that usually gives the                                  clients a really good idea of where                                  risks lie and where hours could easily                                  go go up or or stay steady and then from                                  there you would go into the discovery                                  phase to really to narrow down all of                                  those of those items and to see that we                                  are on the same page there                                  this                                  Oh                                  if if the customer wants to fix a fixed                                  bed in that type of scenario like if our                                  if what we think it's going to be is                                     hours and the worst-case scenario is                                     hours well like fix the bid at                                           like well well really really Pat it                                  because we and and we've shown we've                                  been able to show proof to clients where                                  clients things think that time and                                  materials means like you say it's going                                  to be two hundred hours and you'll just                                  run up this giant budget and by the time                                  we're done you're going to present me                                  with an invoice for                                                      been able to show time and time again                                  that in a lot of cases were coming under                                  the hours because we have padded a                                  little bit and that time and materials                                  works out cheaper than fixed bid unless                                  you've gotten yourself into a really bad                                  fixed bid scenario where you've fixed                                  something that you need like that you                                  knew you shouldn't have based on the on                                  the scope of the project                                  yeah like what the hours are actually                                  tracked at and we change to that model I                                  think about maybe like nine months ago                                  we refuse to give an exact amount of                                  hours anymore just because we know                                  little things come up even if we've done                                  our best to get all the requirements                                  we've done the things where we'll say it                                  won't do this it won't do that things                                  can still come up and it's like it's I                                  don't know it's it's not like you're I                                  don't know what would be a good example                                  it's not it's not a commodity right like                                  it's a service that you're doing and I                                  find it's hard to pinpoint the exact                                  amount of hours even if you've done the                                  same task over and over again it's never                                  going to be perfect so to me it just                                  doesn't make sense to have hours and say                                  yes this this is it if you didn't want                                  to show that range or the client as                                  against seeing ranges then my advice                                  would be to show them one number but                                  it's the padded number right like the                                  high number                                  hours                                  hours                                  so the question is if we calculate the                                  project by by hours is that yeah I mean                                  and I'd say                                                              gather their features and requirements                                  and by each line item will assign hours                                  probably the only scenarios we don't do                                  that is uh we've had a couple of                                  government jobs in Canada where like uh                                  somebody's come to us and literally said                                  like we want those five page brochure                                  site that we know it costs twenty-five                                  hundred dollars to build their like but                                  we only have a fifty-thousand-dollar fix                                  bit and in that case we'll say all right                                  we think we can do it in                                                  we'll come in at like                                                  them feel good and you know the                                  government but that's a that's a that's                                  a far few between scenario just a little                                  secret I'm just interested in what's the                                  going rate or to take an example of the                                  small grocery side for example in fact                                  aside the web designer might have                                  example which is you know five or six                                  informational page is maybe a portfolio                                  nothing particularly sophisticated your                                  going rate for something like that                                  really or the going going rate for in                                  hours I mean we we don't have blended                                  rates or anything like that so we so                                  depending on the project in the wrist                                  level like we have a bare minimum                                  profitability that we have to meet but                                  our rates are typically between                                                                                                                different prices within a single quote                                  so at the lower end sometimes we give                                  discounts for educational institutions                                  that are working with tighter budgets                                  like just as an example but basically                                  our hourly rates our complexity of the                                  project and when I say complexity is                                  because we would have all senior                                  developers on it and they bail out at a                                  higher rate than or we're paying them a                                  higher rate then somebody intermediate                                  junior like a junior person can bang out                                  a five page brochure site like that so I                                  can typically quill it on the low end                                  using somebody like that but if it's                                  complex we need to quote on the high end                                  and that's strictly for like just                                  meeting profitability run                                  um well like I said in in the past                                  couple of months we've been taking on                                  these smaller projects so from the                                                                                                                 like two to three weeks but our sweet                                  spot in projects is kind of like                                                                                                                  six months and the timeline can                                  obviously vary substantially depending                                  on how fast the the customer is moving                                  anything else Josh you had a question                                  for Miss Josh yeah thanks guys
