The Drupal community landscape is changing. A host of new events is springing up: Design Camps, Dev Days, Business Days, Gov Days, CxO summits, and more. The success of these events in bringing together new communities of experts and professionals to facilitate growth and exchange in their areas of common interest is key to Drupal's continuing success.

This session will discuss how Drupal communities--local-, interest-, or vertical-based--are growing and changing. We are looking for insights into what is working, what needs more work and what best-practices are emerging.

This session is for you if you are interested in the nuts and bolts of community, running events, helping yourself and others get the most out of Drupal, or taking Drupal to the rest of the world and showing them what we've got!

Intended audience
Community Members, Community Leaders, Media, Analysts, Business Leaders

Questions answered by this session
Why organize events?

What kind of Drupal events are happening? How do they differ?

What motivates people to join or leave the (local) Drupal community? Why are some more active than others?

What kinds of goals and objectives can communities set for ourselves? How do we measure our success against those goals?

Why do connections with other Drupal user groups, open source projects, and local communities matter? How can we better evangelize Drupal in all these areas?

	                              we've put together similar sessions evil                               and I have put together similar sessions                               for a few drupal camps and we had one in                               Chicago that was a really exciting                               discussion about sort of somewhere                               between a community how to and and we                               focus really heavily on local users                               groups the things that it's been going                               on in Europe morning Christoph the thing                                that's been going on especially in                                Europe in the last six months to a year                                is a whole set of new events so the                                community is trying on splitting in two                                verticals into interest groups having a                                business day having a design day having                                a government day so that people who want                                to work in those areas or who want to                                find a niche in those areas can really                                get together and focus on on their                                special situation rather than just                                talking about everything about Drupal                                let's say so my personal goal for this                                conversation is to is to sort of                                describe where we are and and and how                                successful some of these new things have                                been in end um I've actually brought                                more questions than answers because I'd                                really like to get some insight into                                into how to make this thing grow and                                work better so I'd like to introduce my                                producers my co-presenters kristef and                                doma your company is called products and                                the most exciting thing that I think he                                does is a lot of integration between the                                data information architecture system and                                drupal and that's very very fascinating                                this is eva Rudovsky from pro people I

  people in Copenhagen and there's a very                                vibrant very very active Drupal                                community in Denmark and and yen sis                                gets really interesting insights into                                how to engage people at the community                                level and I'm not on the program today                                because the CMS that the conference                                organizers are using had a problem with                                the forum ah this is my friend Lindsay                                Ogden she has a Drupal shop called Five                                Rings web and a Drupal startup called                                business catapult and she's very                                involved in the Drupal community in                                Colorado where there's also a lot of                                crossover into education and                                evangelizing Drupal at the level of                                schools and colleges to try and get                                younger people excited about it and it                                into the scene my name is Jan my work                                for aquia i am the community affairs and                                manager so this is all stuff that I'm                                very very deeply interested in ah an EVO                                is also community manager pro people                                he's got two titles of when we go so                                kristef are you gonna kick it off what                                we're gonna try and do what we're gonna                                try and do is each talk for a few                                minutes and if you have a burning                                question just throw up your hand and                                we'll get it in there otherwise we're                                going to try and maybe talk present                                                                                                         it'll be interesting enough that we can                                have a conversation together                                so why organize events yeah why organize                                events i've been doing drupal events for                                quite a while now like my major reason                                probably was that I wanted to contribute                                but I'm not a developer so now I thought                                and I always liked building community                                and like you know getting people                                together and doing stuff and initiating                                new stuff that's especially initiating                                new stuff that's that's but I think one                                of the one of the important things when                                you want to go and organize an event is                                think think about yourself like why are                                you doing this and if possible try to                                find a business reason why you're doing                                it because it's great altruism is great                                but there's nothing as good as altruism                                combined with some very enlightened                                self-interest because you're like                                there's going to be tough patches                                sometimes going to be hard and it's                                better that's then you can tell your                                associates like yeah but we're doing                                this because this is going to get us X Y                                Z so um the next slide                                 so because because as I said like some                                 people will just do it for their karma                                 right I think I should really talk with                                 the people that are doing certified to                                 rock that they should spend their net a                                 bit broader because there's there's a                                 couple of obvious gaps in an equation                                 like if you if you do a Drupal user                                 group and you're not really active from                                 on Drupal dork that's not going to show                                 up in your certified to rock yeah so to                                 some extent yeah so there's there's a                                 but but in general at least in your                                 local community it's it's really                                 important and I've seen that being                                 involved organizing things has helped                                 like getting to know more people it's                                 not going to give you business don't                                 expect business not right away that's                                 not normally it doesn't work but it's                                 it's a largest your network you get a                                 lot of loose connections with a lot of                                 different people and someday you'll need                                 to hire someone and and or or maybe                                 somebody somebody will hear about a                                 certain customer who's looking for                                 Drupal and they'll remember like oh yeah                                 you were doing this data thing whatever                                 that was and like there's somebody who's                                 looking for that like maybe should get                                 in touch and I think one of the biggest                                 things is as I said earlier recruiting                                 people finding people that are engaged                                 in the community like for us in our                                 company one of the standard questions we                                 ask on an interview with so what are you                                 doing for the community how are you all                                 ready now involved in something                                 community thing because you know if                                 they're not really community people                                 they're probably not going to engage                                 with the Drupal community and then                                 that's going to have less you know                                 they're not going to be as efficient                                 this is also pretty important like Rio                                 am I organized Drupal                                                    of                                                no I did I did meet some of the other                                 CEOs from from Drupal companies there                                 and that probably was one of the well                                 there was a really good event for that                                 because with small group you got to know                                 a lot of people that you might have seen                                 on a camp or something maybe there was                                 also some people that normally don't                                 show up at games but that want to like                                 get in touch with the community and I'm                                 sure that's this you know it helps it                                 builds your image it helps you in the                                 future also really important for events                                 once you have them you can also organize                                 vertical events like that's something                                 that they've been doing really well here                                 in London and where they pick like very                                 specific verticals like publishing                                 industry and now they do a dedicated                                 event for that like we did evil started                                 at a Drupal government days and you know                                 you had a bunch of government people                                 there and it helps building your                                 visibility like I had one person coming                                 to me saying hey you were involved in                                 that do you want to take part in a bit                                 together so that that kind of stuff can                                 help you build your credibility in a                                 vertical segment and then onto the new                                 types of events evil you do that one                                 so I've been involved in several types                                 of events so I think it all started in                                 Copenhagen where we've been sitting                                 together from all kind of countries                                 people who organized camps and meetups                                 and we thought okay maybe we should                                 organize something more European and                                 then it started dating with developer                                 days and we thought okay but there's                                 something more we can think of and so we                                 define some kind of events that we want                                 to have yearly on a regular base jumping                                 from country to country so yeah and                                 within one year now we had the developer                                 days in Brussels it was a coincidence                                 that I've initiated the government days                                 in Brussels too but for me it wasn't                                 very important to have people from the                                 European Commission participating so                                 yeah I start probably talking a bit                                 that's your part so you told it already                                 okay so that shows to see example                                 alright yeah we the government days we                                 had three that was cool and the way more                                 than                                                                  and it was really important to have                                 local governments but have people from                                 the European Commission there and have                                 people from the European Parliament and                                 from different kind of agencies and yeah                                 it was a great experience to to discuss                                 within these people and there were more                                 actually I think there were more people                                 are related to a government or it was                                 kinda even and that was a very                                 interesting experience because the                                 discussions were very in a very                                 practical because we could discuss real                                 solutions that they need and that we                                 develop and offer so this was a great                                 opportunity and it's the same with the                                 developer days and with the other kind                                 of events like the design camp and the                                 business days right so yeah we brought                                 some security to look after                                 documentation right maybe you can say                                 something about the developer days                                 so the developer days and I was so we                                 wanted to do inter-regional events there                                 was a new thing because before all                                 triple camps in Europe like somebody                                 said oh we're going to do a Drupal cam                                 we've got this team here locally and                                 we're just going to run it and that's                                 when last year in Copenhagen we                                 basically started saying let's let's                                 coordinate just a bit better and let's                                 get more involved and kind of get some                                 sort of rotating thing going and one of                                 the first event sir of that type was to                                 developer days we had I think was                                     people or something yeah something like                                 that that was together with full stem                                 there was Saturday Sunday like real                                 hardcore geeks and as you can see heck                                 all day or heck all night sleep all day                                 but but yeah like a lot of companies in                                 Belgium showed up for that because they                                 they saw it as a really good recruitment                                 opportunity because you got all these                                 developers coming in and I was a good                                 opportunity to talk with people I don't                                 know if it really works like that way                                 that's another question might help in                                 general credibility                                 yeah yeah the design days in Berlin the                                 last ones though there were another                                 design days in Prague yes and Boston                                 alright so yeah                                 yeah not to say not much to say about it                                 it was a lot of fun Morton it's always                                 good for a lot of fun and a lot of                                 interesting topics so yeah if you're                                 into design but one really important                                 point was that now there's about yeah                                 Morton change the name adding to Drupal                                 front-end camp because yeah the main                                 discussion was about teaming and how to                                 implement design so it wasn't really a                                 good fit so yeah now it's the Drupal                                 front-end camp yes what's your question                                 this is                                 so to repeat the question how do we                                 compare the people between the different                                 vertical events like design days in                                 government days and i would say at the                                 design days we had there were a few                                 designers there were a few newbies who                                 entering drupal and mostly drupal geeks                                 let's say it like this and at the                                 government days we had mostly people on                                 a sea level and there were a lot of okay                                 CEO and managing so many                                 right and they were yeah a lot of people                                 from government and from from the                                 European Commission who were actually                                 managing projects with Drupal so yes                                 that it's a big difference and that's                                 the importance about the verticals                                 because yeah I don't see a reason why                                 maybe yeah but you see right                                 right specific specific people that                                 wouldn't attend a drupal camp                                 maybe you should in Colorado we've done                                 library days so it's kind of the same                                 idea as the government days and so it's                                 really a bunch of librarians in the room                                 and still a little more geeky than the                                 general public but they don't they still                                 aren't understanding necessarily what                                 Drupal can do for them or how to use it                                 and so a lot of them want to come in and                                 say we did these cool things and here's                                 our developer to talk about what we did                                 and then other people will come in and                                 ask the same thing the last questions                                 like well we have this problem how did                                 you integrate with this catalogue system                                 so it's a lot of people not really very                                 Drupal people asking how other                                 librarians solve technical problems with                                 a few geeks in the room to help give                                 them some guidance so that's really                                 helpful yes and then we had the Drupal                                 business days this year in Helsinki and                                 yeah that that was a picture after the                                 CXO actually yeah that's Robert                                 so he's not around yeah that was the CXO                                 and it was very interesting like we had                                 it in Brussels we discussed best                                 practices and tools were using we                                 exchanged yeah how we approach things                                 how we approach clients how we can                                 recruit how we can train better people                                 and all kind of different aspects of our                                 daily business and yeah we had then                                 several session very interesting                                 sessions like comparison of SharePoint                                 and drupal and robert douglas talked                                 about the drupal ecosystem and yea                                 mostly sessions that were related to                                 business and there were people                                 presenting their projects from a                                 business perspective not from a drupal                                 shop perspective and that was                                 interesting to the actual clients who                                 implements drupal to have them talking                                 on an event yes and yeah next year we                                 plan to organize the Drupal business                                 days in Vienna on that                                                   yes so you're welcome to join us and to                                 of course we'll set up soon the website                                 and                                 from all the events one one other thing                                 which is important is there's different                                 approaches to organizing an event like                                 people often when they think about                                 events they start thinking like oh I                                 have to charge money and I have to get                                 money for a venue and I need a schedule                                 and i'll have to like curate sessions                                 and and it goes on and on and and it's                                 so much work that you don't necessarily                                 can do and that might be discouraging                                 but it doesn't necessarily have to be                                 like that like the drupal                                              an open space what does that mean like                                 we got microsoft to sponsor the venue so                                 we got the venue for free they were                                 giving the food so for it also nothing                                 to worry about we had one simple website                                 where people could just sign up there is                                 free so no money to deal with no                                 invoices snow oh my god i pay too much                                 or whatever that that was also none                                 there we didn't have a program because                                 this open space means up and open space                                 technology frankly is one of the best                                 formats ever because it's so first of                                 all you don't have to deal with sessions                                 upfront you have to set some general                                 expectations and so that people come but                                 once people are there there's always                                 going to be some common things that they                                 want to talk about around that central                                 central topic I like weed                                                that and people keep coming back to me                                 saying that was really good it was much                                 better than anything where you had fixed                                 sessions set up because we could                                 actually talk with each other and like                                 share best practices and I'm sure that                                 this formats goes a long way and we                                 could use it across a lot of different                                 different places in different niches                                 like I'm now planning a dribble product                                 camp probably is going to be in games                                 probably it's going to be this fall I                                 still need to                                 my my footwork and go and talk with with                                 venues but i'm planning to do it also                                 like that so because i organized drupal                                                                                                       reviewing some stuff and it's manageable                                 so you can do you can do a lot if you                                 plan for scalability don't don't try to                                 do crazy stuff try to keep it simple and                                 the simpler the better you can make                                 really really cool events even on a                                 shoestring budget or without a budget so                                 that that's lost important thing that I                                 wanted to give with this                                 yes                                 our experience in New York is that that                                 particular format doesn't match does it                                 not scale well for our primary vertical                                 which is training which is training so                                 people we get lots of people get hundred                                 people coming to these camps and the                                 absolute number one feedback that we get                                 besides that the lunch sucked was was                                 that it was there was nothing was                                 scheduled you know was like we got there                                 and no one knew what you were we were                                 going to talk about no one had                                 secessions there was no schedule that is                                 absolutely the number one so in terms of                                 scaling I think it depends which                                 vertical you're dealing with and it                                 works really well for small groups but                                 when you all of a sudden you want to                                 hundreds of people want to sign up they                                 want to teach me about Drupal that                                 particular format does not scale at all                                 yet this this one was for business                                 leaders which was funny because normally                                 you would expect business leaders to                                 ones like more structure and you know                                 but but it actually worked really well                                 and and and because they could tank they                                 could talk frankly and there were like                                 people like them there that had a lot of                                 experience that was not really                                 formalized a lot of a lot of ideas                                 thoughts but I think if you if you talk                                 about training and yeah well yeah I                                 think like an open space is really good                                 if there's no clear understanding of                                 what the best practices are yet so you                                 still like everybody still looking for                                 how to do these things and there's a lot                                 of complexity the more complexity the                                 better drupal training like beginner                                 training is not very complex it's like                                 you know there's a certain number of                                 things you have to learn and and you can                                 do that almost you know academic style                                 right to some extent so yeah                                 yep                                 let's take two minutes at the end of                                 this and yell out all the event formats                                 that we can think of and anyone who has                                 experience with what's worked or what                                 hasn't worked or what we think might fit                                 together and that's something that I                                 wanted to explore as soon as I heard you                                 say that so so i'll have my notepad and                                 we'll put up notes somewhere but i'd                                 love to i'd love to i'd love to hear                                 really compactly how that might work yes                                 you want to talk about community                                 motivation and participation ok so our                                 short talk about how we motivate people                                 to join or leave actually the local                                 community I'm not focused on leave                                 because I want people to join so I'm am                                 vice chairman of things to play                                 Association and had been involved in all                                 our camps in Denmark and also in the                                 conference in Copenhagen so for me it's                                 quite important actually we get people                                 involved it's the biggest problem having                                 Copenhagen that there's no people I mean                                 we have a chem now in one month being                                 slight have a when you looked at we                                 don't have websites the ticket system                                 should have been browning last week I                                 forgot to do that I didn't have time and                                 so on so I'm get two people right now                                 Wallace and so we figured out that back                                 years ago we had normal meetups where                                    proceeding and showing code and examples                                 and free people listening that's what we                                 could come up with it stops the same                                 people that was going to present every                                 month so we stopped having one day maybe                                 every three month a half year finding if                                 we when you meet there may be some                                 couple of plants s in pinellas park m                                 style people maybe pay                                                  to get a sandwich that boys find that                                                                                                       without a lot of work just put up on our                                 website that we have this in this the                                 specific day this saturday we meet at                                 the IC university                                 people show up so and instead of the                                 meetups we also tried a new thing you                                 know that all people in the Drupal                                 community a most people idea so we have                                 a monthly day actually our stamp cheese                                 which we stole from the German tablet                                 free community and so we have the second                                 Thursday every week where we have meet                                 at a bar not possession just drank beers                                 two three hours and talk and actually on                                 people people also come companies in                                 Denmark that work with trooper the                                 employees they show up people have never                                 been involved in planning stuff before                                 or in the me jobs or in our Drupal day                                 events show up so for me that is a                                 success but again it's still only                                    people and I mean here we are                                           from from Denmark and most of them from                                 Copenhagen so there are more people that                                 are not showing up but this is also a                                 question actually I don't have the                                 answer to but one I think it could be                                 interesting to hear your comments on in                                 the end finish with the slice                                 and this actually with the with getting                                 people to commit in the Drupal community                                 and participate it's really important                                 actually for planning a trooper camp if                                 you don't have have people became so                                 loudly we camp in the spring because we                                 didn't have people to to commit them to                                 it to help with the planning it                                 so in Colorado we have about four                                 regular meetup groups we have northern                                 and southern we have a western group and                                 we have the denver boulder meetup groups                                 which alternates between denver and                                 boulder in the each meet monthly so it                                 was quite a bot quite a bit of an active                                 community in Colorado but in the                                 northern group we really only have about                                 ten active members and we're trying to                                 figure out I guess I'm kind of getting                                 ahead of myself but we're really trying                                 to figure out how to get how to get more                                 people to come in how to get more people                                 just into Drupal how to how do we                                 motivate people who are sitting in there                                 really sitting in their shops i mean we                                 must have                                                             fort collins in northern Colorado how do                                 we get them to want to come in to to                                 come to the meetup groups and have free                                 pizza and beer which I'm usually paying                                 for to be frank you know how so I guess                                 I'm asking I think we're all asking this                                 question is we have a room full of                                 people here and I'm curious what other                                 people have done to get people out of                                 their hidey-holes and you know the                                 cracks in the wood to come out and do                                 these things and how do we express to                                 them what they're going to get out of it                                 which is more than just pizza and beer                                 it's you know learning a new way to use                                 drush it's having someone to call on                                 when you have to theming projects and                                    hours to do them in you know it's it's                                 all of those little kind of grungy                                 benefits that we all need as geeks not                                 even talking about the business side of                                 it so I guess we'll get to that more at                                 the end but                                 yeah so in Bulgarian for example we've                                 been doing a lot with universities and I                                 think that's important to get people out                                 of ya when they start to learn                                 developing to engage them with Drupal so                                 for example we with being having                                 sessions on universities and yeah                                 cooperating with them they've been                                 featuring us on their website putting                                 flyers and when we have the events and                                 stuff like this so yeah we kind of tried                                 to engage universities and get people                                 new people from there so                                 right all right so yeah yes                                 so yeah the question is how do we engage                                 universities right and it's usually not                                 different than how we engage companies                                 we tell them okay we have a conference                                 here we have a meeting here it's about                                 Drupal that's an international used                                 system very well adopted in universities                                 governments and we have the examples of                                 the stanford university or this                                 university or this government and                                 government and they are really                                 interested to hear more about it and and                                 then we asked him directly can you                                 support us to to engage the students and                                 to get them to learn more about the                                 system and yeah that's how we've done it                                 and it worked and the other thing was                                 we've used friends who know people at                                 the university professors and so yeah we                                 are trying through different channels to                                 get closer to the University                                 we actually we started or I started                                 before drupalcon second that was I think                                 in                                                                      the IT department because i thought you                                 know wouldn't it be fun if we could do                                 like some you know voluntary course                                 about drupal at university so i got this                                 appointment with the head of department                                 of engineering software engineering and                                 I do my story oh that sounds cool by the                                 way we also have this trainee program                                 where you can like get students to work                                 for you part time and then and so we got                                 into that we started this course one                                 year later he had one of his employees                                 who also who was really interested in                                 drupal who started giving that together                                 with me and then and I'm basically now                                 they have a drupal theme in the                                 university that's doing drupal projects                                 I think they're like I think six or                                 seven people or something and they're                                 like you know pure Drupal team so                                 there's different ways some universities                                 this is not going to run right it                                 depends a bit on how open they are for                                 for external speakers because what i did                                 was like a two day course pretty                                 intensive like all day like almost all                                 day long and then with a way to                                 practical thing next to it so that it                                 was not too much work for me either or                                 you know two days and that was it and                                 they work really well yeah we had for                                 example seven sessions at the soap                                 University and later the camp they they                                 send people to the training too so                                 because they want to get involved more                                 themselves like in your case                                 I'm actually very impressed by that I'm                                 i live in Germany and actually know from                                 certain examples in united states that                                 we've approached universities for                                 different different strategies different                                 approaches how do you like to you know                                 we offer our expertise to give I mean                                 fundamentally we're offering sort of                                 real-world employable skills for the                                 students now if they'll let us in and we                                 want to come in for free because we want                                 to talk about dribble and we can't get                                 in there's a lot of turf protection a                                 lot of you know professors who either                                 think well you know that's all just                                 money-making and it's not the world's                                 most beautiful code or you know they're                                 worried that you know if their students                                 see someone making a salary working in                                 in the web you know that they'll run                                 away or there are I know in the United                                 States there are all kinds of                                 certification issues and if you want to                                 you know talk about any given subject                                 you have to run it past the government                                 board and you have to run it past the                                 bureaucracy and you have to run it past                                 a approval process that can take a                                 couple of years at which point your                                 proposal about you know drupal five is                                 is out outdated and then you maybe                                 you're not allowed so so I'm really                                 fascinated to hear that there are ways                                 in and I'm interested if if you did were                                 you using some sort of backdoor strategy                                 or is there just a different kind of a                                 system in place I think the biggest                                 difference is that these are voluntary                                 courses so you're not part of the core                                 curriculum so they're like you know an                                 IT students might have to take some                                 voluntary courses in psychology or you                                 know they can choose themselves from all                                 over the University it's I don't know                                 the exact term but but that that is a                                 lot easier you just need one professor                                 to say oh that sounds fun let's do it                                 and then and then they can sponsor it                                 and get it through the other thing you                                 might consider is talking to Microsoft                                 because they have a really good program                                 all through all the universities                                 actually they're open for collaboration                                 on that so at least in Europe I know the                                 person who can help you help you well                                 they've got people actually working on                                 that the other piece that that I've been                                 trying to set up in my hometown is                                 working with high school students too so                                 I do it with Drupal gardens because it's                                 a really easy way to have something                                 running that looks ok to get high school                                 kids building their little home pages                                 and embedding YouTube videos and working                                 with Drupal to get them excited about it                                 so I'm actually trying to come in on a                                 on a lower level as well yes                                 right                                 yes                                 right                                 yes                                 i yes so so just to repeat this for the                                 recording um you person in gray sweater                                 are saying that um it's it's hard to                                 motivate and get people excited about                                 drupal when you present them a really                                 super dry technical let's start with the                                 basics click click click click click all                                 day without giving them either a vision                                 or a finished product to sort of start                                 with and play with first or to make it                                 fun and interesting so that they can see                                 the point right from the beginning yeah                                 see so so there's this Lego analogy                                 which which seems to be growing in the                                 community and and for me it is it is the                                 difference between be maybe being                                 presented with a Lego set that can make                                                                                                      have because Drupal's Drupal is powerful                                 and flexible right so we have this                                 gigantic box of blue lego bricks and                                 over here we have this gigantic box of                                 grey lego bricks and if you're smart                                 enough you can you know do anything you                                 want and there's no photo and it's just                                 like five lines of text right                                 oh that's a perfect analogy yes so so                                 the perfect Lego set starts with photos                                 on it to inspire you to build something                                 and it's not just a Benedict that's                                 fantastic i'm going to write that down                                 as soon as somebody wants to interrupt                                 me um I think this was this my slide                                 originally oh yes and I have one more                                 question about your what you were                                 talking about before um when we were                                 preparing this session you were talking                                 briefly about people who come in and                                 then their interest sort of peaks and                                 they disappear and and and you know if                                 the patterns that you'd recognized in I                                 don't know if you have any insights                                 around that but I found it really                                 fascinating well I don't have any                                 solutions that actually but we seem to                                 find often when you're making the events                                 then we have it actually it's not open                                 and everything we have a skype chat with                                                                                                          for since second I think just like new                                 people are added and some were leaving                                 and we are planning stuff there it's                                 maybe not the best tool but it was fun m                                 and we can see that people onion now and                                 then popping up and okay I want to help                                 with this and this and this and then it                                 just disappeared for two months we had                                 one wrong over camps a guy I was going                                 to do a lot of stuff he just appeared no                                 one could find him even get Eric get in                                 contact with him on his phone he showed                                 up to the camp okay just just go away                                 it's a saying he's did the same with                                     actually and so now he has no part of it                                 anymore but it's the problem have and in                                 relation to the educational universities                                 we have in Copenhagen actually success                                 with them with the IT University there's                                 a dedicated I University in competing                                 not like what they ride assembler code                                 and machine code and stuff like that                                 more likely we can take a Master degree                                 in aichi for example if you have another                                 education you can build a change and we                                 have four or five or more of the real                                 good developers in Denmark to believe of                                 us that are have studied there                                 so they had a door in and they have been                                 doing a basic Drupal education and                                 training some afternoons so it's not a                                 part of the education to get on the                                 university but it's something that the                                 students can be show up too if they want                                 I'd also have actually now we are trying                                 to approach oncologists in in Copenhagen                                 and we're more DK and some others has                                 been telling them about about Rupa                                 add-on on the question that is on screen                                 I've been going to a lot of different                                 events like bar camps and media media                                 camps and Linux events and I find it                                 very interesting to engage the people                                 that have related interests on other                                 events and to actually connect the dots                                 and involve people from different                                 communities and into the Drupal                                 community so I find it kind of                                 interesting to go to this other events                                 too and meet people there and engage                                 them drupal                                 okay do we have another                                 okay so yeah                                 now I set the level for participation                                 too high here so I don't know how many                                 of you were here yesterday on not here                                 in this but in the scaling the local                                 communities presentation by Greg and                                 Angie and they were talking that a                                 problem that was seen was the separation                                 so in the early days everyone was in the                                 pound drupal IRC and in the forums and                                 people started splitting in two newbies                                 and developers core developers in two                                 different areas and I feel the same                                 thing is happening with the cons because                                 we're all coming to the drupalcon and                                 it's fun but oh my god the fun I had in                                 Brussels in the devlins it was amazing I                                 mean here okay half of the things I                                 don't care so I remove in the dev days I                                 was like left I have to clone myself and                                 got one of these at the same time                                 because they were really nice and that's                                 the problem with verticals are we by                                 creating these vertical events                                 separating ourselves into different                                 groups and is there danger I think it's                                 natural by the way that's poor is there                                 it was the co-lead of the Deaf days                                 together with somebody but he's not here                                 so splitting off I think it's normal                                 it's like Kim the Drupal community is                                 like a fractal if you look at the Drupal                                 community basically you see that it's                                 it's really like a fractal you got                                 dispersed to start growing and started                                 forking like well not forking which                                 started branching and it's deep trenches                                 grow they branch again there's they're                                 still connected but it's a natural thing                                 it's every communities like that this is                                 the the the the nature of networks so I                                 don't think it's a bad thing I think                                 it's actually a good thing because it                                 diversifies our community and it helps                                 in in                                 you know preparing us for four shocks in                                 the indie environment because we get a                                 broader base and we get more diversity                                 you know if I are see if freenode goes                                 down or you know they closed it down                                 there's going to be other communication                                 channels and we'll be able to reboot so                                 I think is very healthy I actually take                                 it as a really really good sign that you                                 got so excited at that event because and                                 I think that that's that's actually an                                 essential tool to making the community                                 scalable because a drupalcon now how                                 many people are here to do deals how                                 many people are here to shake hands how                                 many people are you know there's all                                 kinds of reasons now if we think back to                                 drupalcon brussels where there were                                     people i think that was extremely geeky                                 you know and extrude extry i mean i'm                                 really amazing and you know I knew the                                 whole Drupal community okay um so we                                 can't do that anymore and a vertical                                 event allows you to hook up with your                                 coder buddies and really get into that                                 stuff that you're excited about right                                 and the same for the designers in the                                 same for the people who want to convince                                 enterprise business to go with Drupal so                                 that we can all pay our rent with it and                                 i think it's a it's actually a perfect                                 tool to to help ourselves stay excited                                 stay connected with with what really                                 really interests us and then we still                                 have the global possibilities of the con                                 and the end and the forums and the IRC                                 channels in all these other I think                                 that's I think that's a way to really                                 leverage the size and and maintain a                                 good circle of relevant you know                                 acquaintances within the community I                                 take that as a really good sign                                 no I can't have a beer with everyone                                 here I I got the biggest compliment a                                 month ago when i was at in boston a                                 colleague of mine who was it Peter you                                 were there a colleague of mine said to                                 his wife oh oh it was Mike it was my                                 Jam's really good at drinking beer I do                                 live in Germany                                 so I'll I'll repeat the question while                                 his question was in a relatively small                                 community like in Greece local meetups                                 are working but what kind of people                                 should go what what what should the                                 purpose be who should who's the audience                                 I think you shouldn't define that I                                 think it should be anybody who wants                                 pizza and beer or whatever it is that's                                 your local delicacy and people who want                                 to learn about what and yeah I'm not                                 gonna pay for your Greek peeps I'm so                                 sorry it should be it should be anybody                                 who's interested in figuring out how to                                 make an image gallery it should be                                 anybody who's interested in figuring out                                 how to make an online forum to chat with                                 their teenage buddies and we get people                                 anywhere from                                                           have a couple of librarians who come we                                 have literally a couple of guys who work                                 at staples you know an office supply                                 store during the day and I can kind of                                 throw him a quick here make this very                                 simple view for me at night and I'll pay                                 him                                                                   feel all good like now he's a Drupal                                 freelancer which he is and and that I'm                                 not sure if I'm answering your question                                 but I feel like it's a wide variety and                                 we need to be attracting all of them                                 actually I have an answer for that we                                 have what we call the fort collins                                 internet professionals group which is a                                 much bigger group and it's all internet                                 professionals in northern Colorado and                                 it's word press developers joomla                                 developers it's cakephp it's any kind of                                 web development at all and people come                                 in they talk about semantic web and they                                 talk about CSS and they talk about                                 search engine optimization talk about                                 anything and everything we have an                                 entrepreneur track and we have a                                 business track and that meets once one                                 of those so that way I get to talk to                                 people from different kinds of web                                 development professions and that has                                 really helped me bring in other people                                 other other developers and other and                                 that is that is much broader there's                                 more people and so you're using that                                 social network to bring in other new                                 people absolutely I would definitely                                 bring a potential client to something                                 like that and yeah maybe I'll lose them                                 but you know and to me the important                                 part is to get them educated about the                                 technologies that are out there what                                 their options are if they want to go                                 with joomla well you know then they're                                 going to do that and so I think that                                 maybe maybe a place to start in a really                                 small area without enough drupal                                 traction is to start a whole internet                                 professionals group of be my opinion                                 to two or three people each so they're                                 very small                                 okay the question was about the size of                                 my community so the town I live in Fort                                 Collins is about                                                    about I guess we're about it it's yeah                                 it's pretty it's kind of a lot and then                                 we have we have another community just                                 the south of us another one called                                 Greeley that's just to the west of us so                                 I'm going to guess it about a half a                                 million people altogether in its bits in                                 in about a three-hour radius of driving                                 but we all comes up to Fort Collins as                                 the main central hub for that so there                                 aren't any big shops up there but a lot                                 of little freelancers and two or three                                 person shops yeah or marketing firms                                 with a Drupal component                                 so he was saying he set up a group of                                 professionals who have a common interest                                 not necessarily in Drupal or its                                 specific technology but that they can                                 exchange are they are drupal media                                 professionals right                                 right                                  okay yes hope so up up up vertically                                  organized drupal professionals group so                                  i just wanted to add anyone who was here                                  in at this session in chicago i was                                  campaigning very strongly for                                  sustainable meetup practices and the                                  cunning people who organized the cologne                                  meetup have now created a web meet up                                  and it's the drupal users group that                                  runs it but it's a web meet up and we're                                  getting an incredible incredible                                  traction we're getting me all of a                                  sudden we're getting monthly meetups                                  with                                                                  feel like it's it's moving a web meet up                                  those are web professionals those are                                  people who want to know about Facebook                                  or you know and no nobody its web people                                  yeah anyway so yes last question                                  ah yeah beer is a multiplier for free                                  speech generally                                  I actually think the free pizza is a                                  whole different metaphor because that's                                  also freebies I mean it's like                                  yeah yeah                                  we actually have our northern Colorado                                  meetup group we actually have we're                                  actually have a whole plan set up                                  hopefully this fall it's going to be                                  coming forward is to figure out an                                  ongoing training program probably twice                                  a month to have and as well as a drop-in                                  basis well so what the plan is to have a                                  once-a-week slot that anybody can drop                                  in at this location at this time there                                  will be professional drupal people on                                  site to answer questions and help people                                  out with their project etc and then                                  every other week we're going to move                                  forward on building some simple little                                  project whatever that project is and                                  then of course publish the recipe for                                  that and lost the threat of what you're                                  saying now is try next                                  right so that's where I was going with                                  that was that was the idea that we don't                                  want to just spoon feed them we want to                                  show them how to use IRC we want to show                                  them how to use the forums we want to                                  show them how to how to figure out the                                  learning curve of Drupal and we also                                  want to help weed out some of the some                                  of the chaff because we don't want to                                  just hand hold people along their                                  learning curve if they can't handle that                                  painful Drupal learning curve to some                                  extent we don't necessarily want them                                  here in the community as harsh as that                                  is to say we want people who are going                                  to work hard and want to work to learn                                  that right so we have to I think that's                                  a delicate balance we have to figure out                                  how to bring them along in the the                                  learning without bringing in people who                                  really can't hack it with Drupal because                                  it's not easy                                  so so I'm still very curious we've only                                  got a couple minutes now I'm still                                  really curious to learn about event                                  models that and and what you feel                                  they're appropriate for maybe we can                                  just do that at the table anyone who's                                  got any ideas about that um the last                                  thing I wanted to bring up is basically                                  my personal homework for the next six                                  months okay                                  okay let's let's match that into that                                  yeah so um so I'm in a very privileged                                  position that aquia wants me to figure                                  out how to help grow the community and                                  that as a company you know they're                                  willing to invest in that kind of                                  activity um I want to understand so with                                  especially with your core your point I                                  mean all of this in a much more positive                                  way I don't want to trap people in right                                  but I want people to feel engaged and                                  excited okay but actually what I really                                  need to figure out now for myself and                                  then hopefully we can turn it into into                                  people into numbers into deals in to                                  developers is how do we break out of our                                  out of our very very beautiful echo                                  chamber that we're in like we love this                                  and I see you and I see you when I see                                  you and I see you and you're my friends                                  and it's great and we are making a                                  living at it but you know we need devs                                  and we need clients and we need people                                  who don't know about Drupal yet people                                  to find us and to get excited about it                                  or to you know or to buy our services                                  and and you know we have very                                  charismatic interesting local meetups                                  and we have all these events in and and                                  i'm i'm looking for a toolset for ideas                                  for for for ways to to break us out of                                  the box were in and and and and item I                                  don't know how to get there yet                                  this is the microphone again acquiesce                                  in a in a very unique position that                                  everybody wants to be your partner so                                  you've got a network of companies that                                  are established at local level that not                                  necessarily are involved with                                  communities but they are involved with                                  aquia you could force them well coerce                                  them into the fact that they maintain                                  some kind of partnership with you would                                  they would need to prove that they are                                  sponsoring that they're organizing                                  something with local communities that's                                  that yeah community partners is nice so                                  yes yes yes and we're doing these hello                                  drupal trainings and we're doing certain                                  kinds of free developer trainings to get                                  developers crossing over from other                                  systems I a community partner model with                                  us would be really great um I was                                  wondering to wrap this up maybe that's a                                  that is a really great idea it's                                  distinctly political and it's not what I                                  wanted to talk about here so much but                                  but you people who've run events where                                  drupal ists bring in government partners                                  or bring in business partners or do can                                  we make them feel like they're part of                                  Drupal and like they're part of the                                  community they're not just you know                                  getting getting a drupal lap dance and                                  and a website when they come to want to                                  forgive me I mean that just you know                                  they're getting a free pizza and a                                  website and I would like them to come                                  away feeling like I have a partner's                                  these all these people have my back and                                  I want to be with them you know they                                  they're working for me now but I'm can                                  we make them feel part of it I've heard                                  this many times actually from these                                  people who have been newly engaged and                                  they were really excited about approach                                  of developing this software and about                                  the approach of gathering and exchanging                                  and sharing                                  information so they've been really                                  excited about this and they wanted more                                  of it so I think it works that's right                                  absolutely I think actually to some                                  extent we did that already just by                                  organizing it like it was the Belgian                                  government who is sponsoring most of it                                  so that was and they organized training                                  at the event so so of course you know                                  they're there will stay well you know                                  it's government so it has a certain                                  certain style I think the other thing is                                  to to like there was a like the problem                                  of volunteers that come and go away the                                  thing you have to be careful with these                                  people that overcome it that's really                                  bad people that say I will do it and                                  nobody else does it but else is there                                  coming and going away is very natural                                  people evolve there's always going to be                                  some people that's you know their                                  student now and they have one or two                                  years that they are do like like crazy                                  and afterwards say they have a way                                  that's no more it's just keep getting                                  more people involved                                  so I I have a vision of of doing the                                  next edition of this session i'm calling                                  it
