Dog is a new approach building Drupal sites that deeply embraces Git in order to build portable, deployable Drupal site packages. Dog makes the process of developing, managing, and maintaining a Drupal site easier for everyone from the individual hobbyist to multi-cluster-backed Drupal sites with teams of developers.

With a single command, Dog can roll out an entire new instance of a site - whether that site is intended for hacking by a developer, testing by an automated tool, or real production use. Multiple site instances that satisfy different use cases; one unified process for initial deployment, updates, and development. With its powerful-but-simple command set, dog makes it easy for both humans and computers to work together throughout the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining a drupal site.
