Title: DrupalCon London 2011: DOG: A NEW ERA FOR DRUPAL SITEBUILDING
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Sam Boyer
Dog is a new approach building Drupal sites that deeply embraces Git in order to build portable, deployable Drupal site packages. Dog makes the process of developing, managing, and maintaining a Drupal site easier for everyone from the individual hobbyist to multi-cluster-backed Drupal sites with teams of developers.

With a single command, Dog can roll out an entire new instance of a site - whether that site is intended for hacking by a developer, testing by an automated tool, or real production use. Multiple site instances that satisfy different use cases; one unified process for initial deployment, updates, and development. With its powerful-but-simple command set, dog makes it easy for both humans and computers to work together throughout the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining a drupal site.

Intended audience
Anyone who cares about workflows for putting together Drupal sites.

                              never done that before but there were                               really really explicit instructions and                               the email to Tony that I had to quit                               this applied in the buses all but yeah                               whose Twitter strictly must be one foot                               stuff thank you for writing for cummins                                presentation on on dog the first and                                most important thing to stay in this                                entire presentation is that you are in                                fact attending of April where's Lester                                right now I apologize for that when I                                originally proposed this dog would but                                well you know there's the usual life and                                are being stuff but I could probably                                also the way it off in the fact that as                                will become pretty clear as we go                                through this presentation like what the                                dog is trying to do and especially do                                and provide us pimple in a bit to it and                                the more that I've thought about the                                type of situation is business this thing                                would need to be able to accommodate the                                more than in the rigging apparent to me                                that didn't even get very very good                                but basically used to the spoon that                                unless I say otherwise there's facts                                there are directions that we're going                                and what we will be consistent with what                                the content here however it does not                                exist hepatoma also started to that end                                there is above on dogs tomorrow morning

              was like somebody canceled my phone yeah                                it is plated so I expect them to cancel                                my session if it's paper grab it does                                mean yes so I mean quote coach is                                curious about this in a journal                                questions are obviously welcome it's you                                know evolved go up I do have a hope                                though that folks who might be                                interested in contributing to some                                segments will grow up I have got you                                know areas of dog that are fairly                                discreet that people could work on their                                tongue stove comes to vet that folks for                                technologists a big complicated projects                                I would love to help you show up                                tomorrow and have an interesting                                actually                                there are a lot of goals a lot of things                                that a lot of different tension and I'm                                going to talk about a bunch of those                                different ones so one hand it very much                                dog is also a component prosperity the                                things worth deployment and management                                it is working with upstream Drupal code                                that is just a basically the update                                process as well as for you can process                                of contributing paris baguette and most                                journalists does come for capturing and                                managing a drupal size of overall so                                it's a sort of wide picture but the end                                of the day the thing that I'm hoping the                                experienced dog alone part is instead of                                having to ask a bunch of these                                individual questions from working on one                                or another instance though if you're                                hoping on serenity I grabbed a snapshot                                it is filed with all the stuff dog will                                roll that up in                                alright so one note on capitalization                                too but to the dog and understand I                                loved off and I like I understand that                                military trained animals are anything                                like that this dog is just a capable of                                loving and having royal relationship                                with his owners as I never done that                                having been said for the purposes of                                what this dog has to do I'm going to                                take the nerdy little hipster boot over                                the big giant jug attack dog and guide                                and for me when I think of dog and all                                cast interest I'm going to pick up dog                                and though so I'm kind of insistent                                about lowercase going to do what she                                wants and yeah offer them kind of on                                this note it was totally named dog on                                purpose actually it was cooking dog and                                God and I think we're obvious reasons                                I've made a lot more jokes about dog and                                kissed a lot less people lost though                                however I would like to thank the dog it                                may be the only project on google or                                games period private under bullet organ                                 where you can submit a patch based on                                 nothing but improving the hugging nature                                 of the project and i will accept it                                 there aren't even a component in the                                 interview for bad jokes alright so                                 presentations like this you're supposed                                 to start with a babe like overview                                 picture of problems how to install ice                                 bucket there but anyway actually                                 managing                                 it's difficult to wrap up everything                                 that actually goes into a Drupal site                                 and we started to see some of this yeah                                 it sort of particularly difficult to                                 work across multiple instances because                                 how do you wrap up code and database and                                 files and you know whatever else is                                 dependent part of the Google strike into                                 a single thing that's part of one                                 community around and it can end up                                 making it even difficult or even                                 prohibitively difficult to move hoping                                 you got continuous integration servers                                 and liked angus burgers and everything                                 for all of your Drupal sites Greg                                 absolutely over-pouring of response                                 means buildings but we started to see a                                 standard sort of emerged with that and                                 that's the kind of thing so another                                 problem is that code from tar balls and                                 echoed by that I mean reflect on the                                 fact that we often say you're you're                                 killing code yeah but the purpose of                                 that broken little metaphor is to say                                 that when you separate code from the                                 history that comes from low-deposit                                 party that escorting it's much harder to                                 and alteration                                 that's certainly harder to make                                 alterations to it and contribute them                                 back upstream patterning models for real                                 tight pants ducks process now trust my                                 cuffs with her dresser and dismayed at                                 the very early clerk you know you can                                 use trust to pick up a distinct a                                 establish aliases which helps to mary                                 colter helps us with that ok so my story                                 I'm telling this tactic estoy de pomme                                 but because I realized that the back way                                 to explain bog given all those sort of                                 diverse things that it tries to solve                                 this to start with where I started her                                 dog or what turned into dog the idea                                 that eventually grew into and the game                                 is called mr. modular who need to be                                 friends and I played this game and I go                                 run then try to find a model that will                                 actually do it so I'll check our project                                 ages on the other end it by finest one                                 thing you know I question says lead the                                 project very reasoning                                 and when I open up kamagra file it looks                                 something like this to make and                                 basically every file metaphorical pissed                                 cuz I'm tantalized my project                                 description looks spot-on for watching                                 me but can you really trust me so I got                                 going and and this is this is an                                 interesting time I mean to you but for                                 me this is an interesting time in our                                 relationship of the market because it's                                 a decent chance that this is the only                                 time I'm actually going to like do a                                 detailed overview of this entire models                                 the post was think of a code review that                                 you know like I can contribute back to                                 somebody do I go and I'm going to do                                 look how they're hooking from the                                 tastings of structure to them what I'm                                 going through stay that I noticed                                 something like this we're at Anderson                                 cleared that best long this is an                                 implementation of a big load you're                                 supposed to have both of those                                 parameters nose in types not a big deal                                 not a big deal at all I mean probably                                 not actually going to break anything                                 maybe a little bit of a red flag but I                                 could do the model maintainer a solid by                                 you know following a quick cash that                                 says hey beautiful just for this you can                                 go with a more trivial example how many                                 times we've seen that is right ice to                                 actually I have two in particular                                 Kimball all the time                                 number one you have with you and then                                 you are doing something so same as                                 before you can check get stabbed over                                 here young for context work it off you                                 checked out the burn you check out the                                 new branch you look to problems till                                 later and yeah let's clear to this so                                 okay i'm still there i'm going to create                                 a local                                 we have two and then                                 but plus maybe most importantly                                 speculate you're working on right now is                                 when the real of team updates come in on                                 the future here go real get that                                 represents from here change machine made                                 it's not something often some package                                 here from your reintegrate later it's as                                 simple as running again when you get                                 home to get that latest code into could                                 be go down muggle it's going to use gets                                 real merge mechanics to negotiate                                     it's going to use real get merged                                 mechanics attending goes create emerging                                 the                                                                  things with the commits that you label                                 the end without having to even think                                 about it                                 let me to us out a little bit more                                 completely instead of a hypothetical                                 module let's say that we've got google                                 free and so it looks something like this                                 turbos next to be stored as you've got                                 google web root and then you've got                                 using all these are get clones the                                 problem that we immediately start ahead                                 of course is that that's great you can                                 but you corgi pass out of used well                                 you're immediately get a need exists can                                 actually be a real working spike you're                                 gonna need at least two repositories                                 pack on them because you've got your own                                 customs hanging from a storage and then                                 you've got                                 and play that later the thing to talk                                 about it is pathetic stored the third                                 thing is code an apparent depository is                                 instead of going like a branch news and                                 views or something it stores the job one                                 that could be checked out in it's great                                 if you have like a static library or if                                 you almost never make any changes to it                                 benefits essentially very useful and in                                 my estimation submodels are a very                                 beautiful model for the way that most                                 folks end up using pension money just                                 pushes you clone them down and then                                 periodically you updated but even then                                 there are weird got those with stud                                 modules from other commands I think so                                 any system that makes working with                                 clusters will get because you won't have                                 to use the models when you're in that                                 nice blocked in library but not use them                                 and also                                 another one is ensuring consistent                                 behavior coach local git repositories                                 actually I found Emma stranger because                                 this requires a fair bit of knowledge of                                 get but there's done there's a lot of                                 local configuration that goes into any                                 given git repository which cannot be                                 transmitted by like cloning or anything                                 like that the hooks for example that                                 there were tests for a repository best                                 any of the names of local branches that                                 you create we tend to create local                                 branches that are named as grants                                 locally that's not if you want but if                                 you're gonna have a whole bunch of                                 people working on a site then you need                                 to have all that local branch with                                 Norma's turn or so enforcing that is but                                 you know if the goal here is to make                                 working with clusters of you know why                                 not put other resources that are a part                                 of the overall scary verticals at the                                 same time you can't forget because so                                 and my friends I'm sorry because I there                                 is generally a best practice anyway you                                 should have your product or should not                                 be a group of dr. way there are plenty                                 of things that go into projects the                                 other thing that they need is so the                                 doghouse with the outer repository and                                 the dog sled is a negative thing a                                 little different but the same idea this                                 light contains all the information about                                 what I'll repositories you have we're                                 all to get located the space that the                                 ring                                 things local branch naming all of that                                 Lake ensuring consistency across local                                 environments all that information is                                 expressed contain written to the other                                 one we have to add then so we're going                                 to go for overall state the court's                                 opinion papers sometimes though in this                                 disgusting here let stated we're just                                 going to a fairly straightforward                                 database travel let's add that in                                 another repository will have a TV down                                 repository which means justice created                                 is dumb I don't have to put a transcript                                 repository you have affected they have                                 domestic travel tour at all the eye dr                                 dog makes it easy sterile why not for a                                 couple reasons I mean one is the get can                                 choke on very large file more recent                                 versions a better but very low files                                 which obviously database ounce can get                                 to be me aren't necessarily your handle                                 to love again so having them in their                                 own separate repository which is good                                 your main repository is not a bad idea                                 but then also from from the young from                                 the dog internal perspective retweet                                 repositories as logical so if we can                                 stay we know we don't care where this                                 data based on repository is in the                                 treated to become directors but from the                                 top from the root of that repository in                                 it has a particular structure as a                                 wedding that it you know places its                                 various to compile for the database                                 stuff then we can write routing portable                                 code that does things like no and then                                 let's go back to that remote just                                 generally notes here we have five                                 repositories being discussed only three                                 of them but the word that i use the dog                                 region for these peggle depositories is                                 upstream origin is what you get ready                                 for you clone calling left ringing                                 because they have specific purpose he                                 never ever ever write directly to up to                                 me from the purpose of these is not                                 and again we don't have collapse for                                 everything you can follow with all the                                 arrows in targeting news does not have a                                 collab thank you cuz i was discussing                                 before we own master so we mainly game                                 down when you're positive charge before                                 for everything that we go around to                                 house here one who's terrified by the                                 idea of having a thousand stories option                                 because my kind of end yeah ketosis will                                 do this before like check out of a                                 person's can be configured so that the                                 first time you push it just creates                                 repository on the phone that's an                                 immediate solution for something like                                 that increasing with you know maybe your                                 favorite in stock or github or whatever                                 else could count the number of                                 repositories that you can have this may                                 not be but your own basic on generating                                 a purpose system will do will just                                 welcome back to you when i'm talking                                 about immigration of course dear the                                 note to make all right stone                                 you don't necessarily have to have a                                 different collaborator and pathological                                 a bag for every different type this will                                 work on quite possible that you might                                 wanna share those collab amongst all                                 your steps you can still change paper                                 branches can you keep them clean but you                                 with within this type of a collab                                 strategy you can start building together
