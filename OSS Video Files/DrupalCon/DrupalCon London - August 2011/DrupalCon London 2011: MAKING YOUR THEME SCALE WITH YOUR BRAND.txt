Brands grow organically and often undergo complete re-design. How do you prepare for change and build a scalable brand? Our session will show how, when you theme effectively, Drupal has the power to grow with a brand and make design changes simple.

We will talk about:

Tools and processes for envisioning the brand and the theme
Creating smart markup
Thinking in systems rather than 'pages', and building sustainable software
How the right tools can help you (CSS libraries, base themes, helper modules)
Finding balance between theoretical purity and practical solutions
Collaborating with themers, module developers and designers
Documenting the process and sharing assets
Intended audience
Experienced themers, module developers, designers, project managers.

Questions answered by this session
How to get more control over templates, and for instance, prevent tons of overrides when you have many views that require custom markup

How to make CSS systems (Or: why Drupal's HTML is actually awesome)

How do I 'design for Drupal'?

How can I use Drupal to manage brand assets?

How do I as a project manager, get the most out of my team?

and all                               kinds of different design for the last                                                                                                      presenting with with martin barber shop                               Martin you want to talk a little bit                               about yourself I'm from touching the                               projects I let my time mostly making                                themes I communicate a lot with external                                designers and try to be the like that                                the person who like coordinates stuff                                between designers and themes to get the                                optimal result so what we're going to                                talk about today is a kind of a                                combination of brand and theming I'm                                going to get into a little bit of sort                                of you know theoretical stuff about                                brand and a little practical stuff about                                brand and then I'm going to kick it over                                to Martin at about half the halfway                                point and he's going to sort of get into                                more of the nitty-gritty you know actual                                theming nuts and bolts of the things                                that that you can do to make this a                                reality in your actual sites so as I                                said before I have been involved with                                brand for a very long time and long                                before actually I was involved with with                                with theming for Drupal or even with                                with user experience design and you know                                one of the things I wanted to do when I                                when I put together the presentation is                                I wanted to oh I'm sorry actually first                                of all before we go before we go any                                further I wanted to ask a little bit                                about who who's in the audience today                                how many how many of you would sort of                                self identify as module developer                                designers                                so there's a lot of designers project                                managers a few of those femurs okay                                about even on the-- murs and designers                                so anyway so talking about brand I                                wanted it I was putting together my the                                deck for today I wanted to try to find                                some kind of a funny or a humorous or                                insightful interesting quote about brand                                maybe from one of my sort of design gods                                like you know massimo vignelli or paul                                rand or one of these people who i looked                                up up to and respect and I was doing us                                I was doing a lot of Google searches                                around you know brand and quote and                                funny quote and funny brand quote and                                unfortunately I wasn't really able to                                find anything really funny and the thing                                the thing that kept popping up on funny                                and Brandon quote was Russell Brand and                                funny quotes from from him and he's a                                very funny man I thought kind of                                dovetailed in quite nicely since he's                                English so here's a here's a little                                quote from Russell Brand it's even as a                                junkie I stayed true to vegetarianism I                                shall have heroin but I shan't have a                                hamburger what a sexy little paradox so                                I thought that was quite funny anyway it                                does say a little bit about personal                                brands people talk a lot today about                                personal brands people have a personal                                brand do you have a personal brand and                                you know obviously sexiness and being a                                kind of a rock and roll poet and being a                                former junkie are all sort of aspects of                                Russell Brand's sort of quote personal                                brand but I think this is kind of it's a                                little bit silly in a way because the                                brand really is something that's sort of                                an imitation of something that's really                                an essential human quality which is the                                personality so these are really kind of                                aspects of his personality more than his                                personal brand and you know I think that                                all brand kind of grows out of the                                personality everyone has you know facial                                features a dress style at a tone of                                voice you know expressions                                things that they do all of these aspects                                that sort of add up to who we are                                they're sort of natural and they're the                                natural way that we sort of interact                                with each other and and no you know                                who's who and and whether you can trust                                somebody or whether you really want to                                be friends with somebody how you                                interact in social situations it's all                                about you know essentially about your                                personality and the brand is really it's                                 it's it's an impulse that arises out of                                 this personality so what I'm going to do                                 right now is I'm going to I'm going to                                 talk a little bit about sort of i'm                                 going to do the history of brand in                                 three images so first image here is this                                 is an ancient indonesian mask and one of                                 the first ways i think that human beings                                 ever sort of began to identify                                 themselves as a group is you know                                 through creating forms of dress and                                 masks as one of them scarification lots                                 of different ways that people you know                                 did things to themselves to say                                 something more than this is just who I                                 am but I identify as part of this larger                                 group so I thought was really                                 interesting that sort of this shape then                                 kind of gets repeated through history                                 this sort of face shape gets translated                                 into other forms with fast forward into                                 the Middle Ages and you've got this sort                                 of shield shape that that echoes that                                 sort of mask you know form and then this                                 is again this is a kind of an example of                                 a group a group identification you've                                 got the coat of arms which is starts                                 with the family and then it becomes                                 something that identifies you know the                                 the the city-state the nation-state you                                 know and larger and larger and larger                                 and groups of people over over the                                 course of history you know create these                                 these symbols or images to essentially                                 put up put an image or a personality on                                 a group that's essentially what the                                 brand is it's putting a personality on a                                 group so fast forward to today and we                                 have again the same shield the same coat                                 of arms is still reappearing throughout                                 you know you know modern corporate                                 branding and it's it's it's echoing and                                 it's                                 drawing from this essential quality of                                 you know let me try to put some kind of                                 visual structure on on on a group to                                 create a personality for a group which                                 is what a brand is all about it's the                                 shared identity of a group so what about                                 the theme so the theme we're obviously                                 we're here to talk about Drupal we're                                 here to talk about drupal theming the                                 theme essentially is as the same thing                                 as the brand it's just the expression of                                 the brand on the web or in electronic                                 form whether it's on the web or on a                                 mobile phone or or however you're using                                 Drupal to you know to disseminate your                                 theme you know across the world that the                                 theme is really inextricable from the                                 brand and it doesn't matter whether                                 you're whether your organization is a                                 corporation or a non-profit or a                                 government agency these are all the                                 brand is sort of you know essentially                                 just that expression of the identity of                                 the group and so what you want your                                 brand to be is you want it to be                                 consistent you want that expression to                                 be the same everywhere anybody sees it                                 so that they can so that they can react                                 to it and apprehended and interact with                                 it in much the same way that that they                                 would interact with you know on a human                                 level with it with it with with another                                 person you want your brand to be that                                 that personal expression of the group                                 and that people can understand it and                                 they can you know know about who you are                                 and you know and you can put forward                                 certain ideas like you know we're                                 trustworthy or we're intelligent or                                 we're you know whatever it is that the                                 that are the sort of core values of the                                 organization so when you start in this                                 process I think it's important I'm going                                 to talk a little bit in a second about                                 audiences about personas and about you                                 know how you know who you're talking to                                 and know who you're you're telling you                                 brand story too but before you get into                                 that aspect of it you really need to                                 think about who is this group I mean the                                 brand is the identity of the group who                                 are the people in the group and more                                 importantly who are the people in the                                 group who are actually going to have                                 control over aspects of the brand and                                 over aspects of the theme and how those                                 things are sort of you know passed out                                 into the world so I think it's important                                 this is obviously this is not a this is                                 not every organization but it's you know                                 I think many organizations have you know                                 similar categories is to this you know                                 when you're you're talking about you                                 know creating a you know a site or a set                                 of sites you know to to carry forward                                 your brand message you usually have a                                 product manager usually have femurs and                                 developers who are who are putting                                 together the site and then a lot more                                 sort of what I call section owners                                 people who are you have one person who's                                 sort of the editor of the blog section                                 or the editor of a of another particular                                 you know section of content in your site                                 or in your number of sites and then you                                 have content editors who are actually                                 involved in the day-to-day business of                                 writing blogs putting together articles                                 you know getting you know the content                                 which expresses the you know the ideas                                 that you're that are core to your brand                                 out to the public so it's important to                                 think about them and then also Martin is                                 going to get into you know at a later                                 point he's going to he's going to talk a                                 little bit more about you know how we                                 divide up roles and tasks and                                 intelligently look at you know what each                                 of these people doesn't and and and how                                 they inhabit and what what they have                                 authority over essentially so but really                                 ultimately what you want is you want to                                 have as little theming ability as                                 possible at the lowest level and then                                 and I by that I don't mean you know                                 personal ability the ability of the                                 person to to to come up with theming but                                 you want to sort of take that out of the                                 hands of the content editor the section                                 owner and leave as much as possible you                                 know at the top of the pyramid so that                                 you can maintain that consistency                                 because otherwise you're going to have                                 certain section owners theming things                                 one way and other people are theming you                                 know parts of their site in a different                                 way and and and quickly everything                                 starts to get out of control and again                                 Martin is going to get into the sort of                                 nuts and bolts of exactly how you do                                 that how you maintain that consistency                                 and how you keep your theme small so                                 that you can you can make sure that that                                 those things are sort of taken off the                                 plate of the people who really need to                                 be concerned about you know well what's                                 this blog post say not what color is the                                 h                                                                        so I'm going to talk a little bit now                                 about audiences and personas so how many                                 people have worked with personas before                                 or use personas in their in their                                 day-to-day work ok a few so personas                                 essentially there's a lot of                                 documentation there's a lot of you know                                 there's been a lot of writing out there                                 about what is a persona and just briefly                                 essentially a persona is is is the is                                 the core user of the product or the or                                 the message that you're trying to get                                 across so say for instance if you are                                 talking about a product the the persona                                 is is the person or persons and usually                                 there are several personas in a in a                                 personas document when you start to put                                 together personas to figure out you know                                 how your how your product or your site                                 gets used you think about two or three                                 different sort of core users who are the                                 people who are who are regularly using                                 your product or regularly using your                                 site and and and that's very important I                                 think every design team and every                                 project really needs to have a good                                 personas documentation and                                 you know really keep going back to them                                 on a regular basis to understand why are                                 we doing these things why are we why are                                 we building in this way does it fit you                                 know our personas but then in addition                                 to the personas you have this sort of                                 greater universe of you know of people                                 who might be coming to your site so for                                 instance in the case of a you know a                                 company site you might have your your                                 your your key personas two or three key                                 personas who your product users but then                                 there's this other sort of these other                                 sort of ancillary kind of audiences                                 which are people who might only rarely                                 are occasionally come to your site but                                 they have to be thought about and and                                 considered you know particularly when                                 you're putting together your your                                 content strategy your information                                 architecture the and as well as your                                 brand design because brand will sort of                                 you know we'll tailor itself                                 specifically to certain certain                                 audiences in slightly different ways so                                 in a company site you might have                                 partners you might have media companies                                 who are writing things about you are                                 writing you know articles about about                                 your company you might have potential                                 hires you might have a in the case of an                                 open source company you might have you                                 know community members people who are                                 you know are affiliated or associated                                 with what you're doing but not                                 necessarily working or employed by you                                 you might have competition or investors                                 people want to give money to your                                 company to make it keep going hopefully                                 and you know all of these all of these                                 audiences need to be sort of taken into                                 account in the when you're thinking                                 about how you how you structure your                                 your your site your information                                 architecture so just getting into the ia                                 a little bit it's important when you                                 when you've worked with your content                                 strategist and you've come up with your                                 audiences and your personas to have a                                 real simple clear visualization of your                                 ia and you know a lot of people use a                                 tree I use a tree it's not essential if                                 you have some other visual metaphor                                 which you would you find more                                 appropriate or what you think is a                                 better way to                                 you know to step back from the from the                                 hole and see sort of all the parts and                                 how they work together then then that's                                 great but it's just important that you                                 can do that then you can sort of get it                                 all out on paper print it out maybe put                                 it up on a wall a lot of people put it                                 up on a wall i know that when we were                                 working on the aqua is site we took the                                 all with the entire old aqueous site                                 which many of you probably have seen                                 from you know two or three years ago or                                 you know it's been around for a while                                 before we we did our update and we we                                 took every single page in the site or                                 every single main section page and                                 printed them all out and stuck them all                                 on the wall it was like an it was a wall                                 the size of the screen filled with pages                                 with little pieces of tape and you know                                 sharpie lines going in between them and                                 as soon as you see all that you know it                                 was a great eye opener for us because                                 immediately we saw all these holes and                                 oh my god then look at this workflow                                 here what does the user going to do here                                 there'd sort of set down a you know                                 shunted down a dead end and you know oh                                 here's a hole and you know a things you                                 know come forward very very quickly and                                 then we use that to create you know an                                 information architecture map that for                                 the new site that sort of was more you                                 know more well organized we're able to                                 step back and see the whole picture and                                 sort of map it out where do we want what                                 do we want to happen in all of these                                 different cases and for all of these                                 different audiences and sections within                                 the site so then the other thing that                                 you can do which I strongly recommend is                                 to create a master theme document which                                 is in in the case of what we did we put                                 together a document that that was that                                 was done in the context of our site                                 design of our approved site design and                                 and showed how every element of the site                                 was going to be themed now chapter three                                 put together a great one of these which                                 you can which is available on the web                                 interesting side note you notice that                                 chapter                                                  so people are constantly rebranding and                                 updating and this this is for a few from                                 a few years ago and you'll see that that                                 their whole brand identity has evolved                                 and and and changed and I love the new                                 stuff that they that they're doing now                                 it's really it's really terrific but                                 they put together this document a few                                 years ago which is essentially it's a                                 it's a multi multi state fireworks                                 document that has essentially every                                 single element that you would need to                                 theme in Drupal and so a designer can go                                 in and open this document up and sort of                                 essentially just you know change fonts                                 change colors change change the styles                                 and then begin to sort of build out                                 their own branded sort of style guide                                 from that and that's essentially what we                                 did when we when we created the Aqua                                 site we put together all of the                                 different elements all the different                                 HTML elements obviously h                                             unordered list or two lists etc this                                 document actually this is just just a                                 snippet of it it went on for several                                 pages and went into you know a great                                 deal of detail with block quotes and you                                 know two columns of text and you know                                 little pieces of intro text all kinds of                                 different theme elements as well as you                                 know overrides things that would areas                                 where the essential theme would have to                                 be overridden for instance in the                                 sidebar you know there's there's a                                 different ordered list style than there                                 is in them in the main content area so                                 that's just sort of you know a kind of a                                 quick overview of you know of starting                                 with brand thinking about brand is the                                 face of the organization of as the as                                 the sort of personality of the group and                                 then how to begin to you know pull that                                 all together and and and put that                                 message into into a theme which is sort                                 of synchronous with the brand and                                 and gets across you know your brand                                 personality to to the to the people who                                 who you want to to see it now Martin is                                 going to get into talking about you know                                 some of the nitty-gritty theming                                 elements and so and then you know we'll                                 we'll go into questions after that so                                 let's go ahead Martin so whose theming                                 folder looks like this I've had                                 selectors that look like this and we                                 whole hats these moments that clients                                 have added a page or a block and they                                 had to call it hey it looks not themed                                 okay you do that for me this happens to                                 a lot of themed errs and well we're                                 going to take a look at how it can make                                 things more robust so and it's actually                                 a thing that not only thieves have an                                 impact on its wiley acts asked like are                                 there project managers and module                                 developers in the house and so in this                                 session i'll mostly take a look at                                 things from a Themis perspective but                                 also that mention just a few things for                                 developers and project managers to pay                                 attention to                                 so the problem actually is that there's                                 no amount of abstraction between the                                 content of the site and the presentation                                 of the content so every time there                                 becomes but every time content grows or                                 changes and the theme needs to grow so                                 what we want to do is like maybe theme                                 behave like a lens so the side can grow                                 but the theme will say the same size                                 sure it might grow just a little bit                                 from time to time but that will be                                 abstraction between the two so I came up                                 with just a set of principles that I                                 stick with to make themes more scalable                                 this is about separating structure from                                 components and a component this code                                 that just works regardless of context so                                 it can be a block or a menu or maybe a                                 search feel or just anything really and                                 the whole point is that it always just                                 works no matter the region or the page                                 it's always the same and structure                                 connects these components with content                                 so that we form a page                                 the structure of the page I'm easily                                 seen people just going to the block                                 administration page there's no content                                 no components so we just see the                                 structure then once it's connected you                                 can look like something like this                                 in this process of working with                                 components markup is central so every                                 time every time you need to add                                 something you look at pattern library                                 like having shared you from the aqua                                 aside with all the just what does ahead                                 and need to look like or how does it a                                 search bloc need to look you look at                                 that and you match it with a component                                 if it's not already built in yet you                                 build a component then you know which                                 market to write for that piece of the                                 design and the important part is here                                 that it needs to be documented so when                                 you look at templates in Drupal you                                 always see these massive comment blocks                                 documentation for components doesn't                                 need to be that way but it's about                                 module developers that maybe may not be                                 familiar with front-end development best                                 practices and those are even people that                                 you on document for like I've created                                 this component and every module can use                                 it it's maybe a piece of CSS JavaScript                                 so just document short how should this                                 be used and it's also important to stick                                 with it I love people are bit                                 unsure about it when you work with                                 external designers death may not                                 understand all this I don't know how                                 Drupal works but that's not the point                                 you should take control of that and for                                 example in the design i showed earlier                                 we have two different search blocks to                                 both search blocks but one has a blue                                 button the other one is a black button                                 so you could style those space on the                                 region that they're in but then you're                                 back at the beginning and you thrown                                 have you everything overboard again so                                 it's important to start learning to                                 think in the false and overrides                                 everything needs the default so when                                 people add stuff it will always look                                 acceptable so usually the most simple                                 version of something is the best default                                 and the way where you do this is we use                                 the Cascade in CSS to make overrides of                                 components as efficient as possible so                                 that                                 the one with the blue button will be                                 default and the override would just                                 override the color of the button so we                                 stack two classes and that way we can                                 keep the benefit of it being                                 well                                 you can predict what it will do it will                                 always be that surge block with a black                                 button and we talked about sticking with                                 this way of working people tend to make                                 separate style sheets for IE fixes for                                 example and this is also something that                                 doesn't but it really conflicts with it                                 because once you change the component                                 you should be able to predict what                                 effect it will have and if you have                                 fixes for that component in a separate                                 stylesheet you can quickly lose sight of                                 that so one thing that html                                              for example does is act classes to HTML                                 elements you can put them on the body or                                 David side body doesn't really matter                                 but the point of the classes is that you                                 can style things four separate browsers                                 in its own context so keep everything in                                 sight                                 and so making components is basically                                 just writing CSS JavaScript maybe made a                                 template for it                                 but how do we connect it with the output                                 from modules modules have a lot of                                 classes by default but they don't match                                 the classes that you came up with for                                 your components so there are actually                                 modules that can do that this place we I                                 think cause you will be familiar with                                 you can use it to connect classes or                                 markup with entities notes user profile                                 comments and I've had situations where a                                 designer just gave me three designs I                                 like                                                                   them with the contacts and when I didn't                                 have this place we I decided a lot of                                 templates with the same code just to                                 match them with content types and with                                 this week you can keep that to just one                                 template I make the connection in the                                 admin                                 so block class is a module which lets                                 you classes two blocks so it sounds a                                 bit weird maybe to add a class for                                 blocking the at me instead of in your                                 theme which actually makes sense because                                 blocks by default to have classes based                                 on the modular that comes from and well                                 as a themer you don't really control                                 which modules are used was a good time                                 so you want to be able to make a module                                 developer decide the class himself once                                 he came up with a block and that way                                 your styling will automatically be                                 attached to the block that he came with                                 i believe the module also lets you                                 create templates for the blog that you                                 just create a class for but i should                                 never use that because most of the time                                 you just changed the stuff inside the                                 content veritable of the block the block                                 markup is by default which is just a                                 wrapper so manual attributes let you do                                 the menu items add classes to menu items                                 and                                 I see lots of people styling the menu                                 items based on the IDS that menu items                                 get which is possible but it can get                                 really risky when you work with multiple                                 environments like a development                                 environment in a production environment                                 the IDS will change maybe you know up                                 front so you ready on the safe side and                                 just use classes and attach them again                                 in the admin uses a little field at the                                 left bottom of the interface i believe                                 to just add a class that few and it's                                 basically the same with blocks you don't                                 know what the view is called me or maybe                                 there are multiple views that need to                                 have the same styling but they all have                                 different classes because the name of                                 the view is different so you can use a                                 field to add a class view component                                 semantic feverfew's                                                   classes two rows and feels so we have                                 just a little more control so control is                                 nice but the problem still is that you                                 can't really reuse it every time that                                 you need to change something interchange                                 multiple times if you have used it for                                 multiple views                                 so this place to do it again is also                                 able to add note this place for a few so                                 we just have a template for a note                                 layout and use it for certain views that                                 way it's in the repository so you can                                 have again just one place where you can                                 change things                                 please stop Loggins actually really                                 scary for most lemurs because its object                                 oriented PHP i know that i can't really                                 program object oriented PHP so but it's                                 also just really powerful if display                                 sweet or semantic fuse or whatever can't                                 help you out this might be your last                                 option and in that case I will advise to                                 work together and let some module                                 developer help you out with this                                 so it's important to invest in the false                                 everything has a default in Drupal so                                 when I said learn to think in the false                                 triple actually help you with that so                                 and the reason that this is important is                                 to make the acne not rely on fevers                                 people need to be able to do things that                                 mean where I'll constantly have to                                 consult themed look I've changed and now                                 it's broken and we want to keep the                                 codebase small yes                                 efficient and you won't do everything                                 once like I said when you need to change                                 something you want you don't want to do                                 it six times                                 so a good default is flexible so you                                 don't have to override but simple in                                 case you do have to override and that's                                 about just not having to do things for                                 this being the blue things easily really                                 you can have a really great default that                                 works for as long as it works but it is                                 really complex then you can really over                                 right at all and the thing with default                                 there's a lot of criticism on markup in                                 the group of committee of which part of                                 I agree with but it's also just a lot of                                 passion classes and extra lives and if                                 you don't know why the class and these                                 are there I can advise to read the                                 drupal market guide which was actually                                 written for module developers so you can                                 also just take a look at that what how                                 do I document like components for module                                 developers this is just kind of the same                                 thing but in more general way this tells                                 you like power struck classes structured                                 into a ball                                 that's really the lava just learn to                                 love the markup actually don't take                                 everything for granted but just don't                                 change it because you it wouldn't not                                 how you would do it because it's made                                 with the point of just making it more                                 flexible as n is a base seem that well                                 the mission is to have a place where you                                 can quickly improve defaults from core                                 or four complete modules and have a                                 benefit from that immediately wants its                                 committed and not just that major Drupal                                 releases so if there's a market that you                                 really can't live with then well just                                 change it but that I would say also                                 consider turn it into a patch as well                                 once you've done that anyway so                                 fix the default and just help module                                 developers out with this and hopefully                                 yeah you won't have to tweet everything                                 yourself constantly so you can just                                 focus on your own project we want to                                 keep everything simple so it's about                                 when I said I overriding should be easy                                 the idea is not to override in the first                                 place or a theme stay small it's like                                 one of the principles like key because                                 base small but there are actually times                                 when overriding is a pair of K so the                                 compass or SAS hype it doesn't really                                 have much to do with scalability but                                 there's one little thing that I wanted                                 to share with you in case you haven't                                 seen our people like using sprites a lot                                 and look it's great to just get a little                                 performance improvement but the problem                                 really is that once for example the                                 icons on the left just in a redesign get                                 a little bigger then all the images will                                 move and have to update all the                                 background positions in your theme which                                 can get really complex and                                 time-consuming                                 so what you're doing here is just                                 confessing things manually which never                                 been done actually you wouldn't compress                                 CSS manually Jesus Tripoli wide space                                 when you say that you can't edit it                                 anymore so as the same actually goes for                                 in his comp ads that you just keep your                                 images well organized and then lets us                                 create a sprite for you so in your own                                 code go f is and it will compile that in                                 two separate classes that you could use                                 in the market to get that specific part                                 of the sprite that spot and if you don't                                 want to use the classes and you can use                                 the mix-ins from compared to adam to                                 your own selectors                                 keeping templates simple as well                                 important and it's important to know                                 when to pre-process when you use the                                 functions we went to override and that's                                 a lot of things where people just stack                                 anything in the template but maybe they                                 don't know they can preprocessor maybe                                 isn't know which the functions are there                                 so when they don't know when to use it                                 pretty positive are basically just two                                 separate PTP logic from mark up so                                 markup states readable that's about it                                 through functions are basically like                                 components they always do the same                                 regardless of where you are modular                                 theme or once it's available it always                                 does that one thing so they're                                 predictable I've had a site with lots of                                 lists on it and for accessibility                                 reasons it would became a requirement                                 that every list have its own skip link                                 so if every module and every place in                                 the theme use the drupal theme item list                                 consistently don't only have to eat add                                 that's Kipling at once and then be done                                 just override a theme function put the                                 code in the to mean a lot of modules                                 don't actually so I have to change its                                 to it in                                                                 where I would like to just start making                                 patchy get all modules to use flu item                                 is consistently                                 it's also important to know when to get                                 someone else so some people might be                                 just a little afraid this I think                                 they're mad you will get upset or                                 something but                                 the principle is really about saving                                 time staying focused and doing things                                 properly so that thing about view stock                                 plugins with PHP here I could learn to                                 program like that but it would be a                                 great distraction from you as a                                 front-end developer so                                 to stay focused i would say got someone                                 else to do that get someone to help you                                 out with that so another example when                                 it's good to collaborate with developers                                 a client yeah once want something like                                 this so content type with a lot of                                 fields and all have a lot of text and                                 they want so like a table of contents at                                 the top of the page which could jump to                                 all separate fields so I could come up                                 with a solution for this as a theme                                 which would probably be something like I                                 create a template for the content type                                 and then at a preprocessor for it and                                 loop through all the fields and create a                                 variable table of contents and printing                                 template and then I would already filled                                 templates and well put the the IDs in                                 there so I can actually jump through                                 those but                                 guys is more of functionality than how                                 it should look so it makes it seem                                 bigger without ya being actually useful                                 so this is actually want just this you                                 want extra checkbox in the display                                 settings and say like what ok that new                                 fields and this one should come up in                                 the table of contents or not so we have                                 more control and you've made it more                                 scalable so                                 maintenance gets considerably faster and                                 you can reuse it more easily across                                 project if you want to                                 collaborating with fellow femurs work on                                 the same project it's not always easy                                 you'll quickly get in each other's way                                 so this is what a lot of companies do I                                 think just say the one theme of you go                                 through the block you the web show up                                 and you deform section or something so                                 based on site section you assign tasks                                 to people but this really could cause                                 conflicts because there could be a lot                                 of components that appear on multiple                                 sections of the site so then you still                                 don't know how you should do what people                                 will get in each other's way                                 a thing that a lot of people already do                                 is separate elements line from page                                 structure for example with a reset dot                                 CSS and a layout dot CSS is one way to                                 do it you could keep doing that with                                 components so I don't mean just create                                 separate style sheet for components                                 that's not necessary but assigned                                 components to people instead of side                                 sections                                 so this prevents people from having to                                 constantly touch each other's code but                                 yes you still need to document as                                 documentation is more about maintenance                                 than about initial development so you'll                                 still probably be confronted with each                                 other sooner or later                                 so so yeah so I think a lot of what                                 Martinus has said and gone through kind                                 of talks to the fact that you know you                                 want to you want to essentially you know                                 keep it as simple as possible so that                                 you know you divide up your your tasks                                 well between between your themas you you                                 you know you create a simple clean light                                 lightweight theme and you don't create a                                 situation where which you know we've run                                 into I'm sure we've all run into where                                 you know there's there's something                                 that's not themed and all of a sudden                                 people I I've created a new piece of                                 content and it pops up and it's it needs                                 to be themed anything that anybody                                 creates at any time in your site should                                 should should at least appear with some                                 kind of a default theming on it that you                                 that you've designed and that didn't                                 come from a module and it didn't come                                 from you know the default of the                                 defaults of Drupal so that's that's the                                 sort of Holy Grail that's the you know                                 the ultimate goal and I think that you                                 know a lot of these that you know the                                 sort of steps that Martin outlined to                                 you know and lead to that so and then                                 you know all the real thing that sort of                                 brings this you know full circle and                                 makes it you know so important is you                                 know remember when I talked about                                 chapter three and how they they updated                                 their brand will that we did the same                                 thing AHK we updated our brand companies                                 update their brands they change their                                 color palettes they changed their font                                 choices they they constantly evolve                                 their brands brands are not static there                                 there there there's you know I don't                                 know if anybody has ever seen this sort                                 of evolution of the sort of coca-cola                                 logo over the years you know things you                                 know things grow and change and evolve                                 and that's definitely going to happen so                                 what you don't want to have happen is ok                                 we changed our logo now I have to update                                 our company logo in                                                      would it be great to just be able to go                                 in and update the company logo in one                                 place and that single image file as                                 being referenced                                 winner you know that's just a simple                                 kind of a simple example of essentially                                 you know what we're talking about if you                                 theme intelligently and you use some of                                 these methods then what had you know you                                 theme intelligently both from a design                                 perspective and from a you know an                                 actual theming perspective then you have                                 to do things you know far fewer times                                 you change a few simple things and you                                 and they cascade through everything I                                 mean that's why we have a that's why                                 there is something called the CSS                                 cascade you know so that so that the                                 simplest changes can affect you know                                 everything in your entire site no matter                                 whether your site has you know                                          or five million pages it's all you know                                 there in the Cascade that's why we                                 create classes that's why this you know                                 the sites are structured as they are                                 that's why Drupal has a theming layer                                 you know so that so that these things                                 can be done quickly and simply and you                                 can you can make big changes to to your                                 design without having to worry about you                                 know going and cleaning up every little                                 place that you know that it might be                                 that it might be different throughout                                 the site so I'm designing repeatable                                 patterns and designing for the CSS                                 cascading now and if you didn't do it                                 right the first time which I think kind                                 of was the case with us then then you                                 really quickly learn this lesson because                                 you know you go through and you're like                                 oh well now I have to clean up all of                                 this cruft I have to go through and I                                 have to I have to you know do this sort                                 of you know back-breaking you know work                                 of going through everything and changing                                 all these little overrides and hunting                                 throughout the the site for you know                                 things like for instance inline CSS                                 styling which is you know the bane of                                 our existence so you know so don't                                 assume your old content will flow                                 seamlessly into the new theme that you                                 know it certainly if you didn't if you                                 didn't follow the steps you know                                 you're going to have you're going to                                 have big gaps and big holes and things                                 are going to things are going to reflow

             Martin talked about in terms of                                 documentation and the importance of you                                 know of the-- murs and developers you                                 know not just writing a little comment                                 in their code but but writing real you                                 know multiple paragraphs of detailed                                 documentation of I did this because and                                 if you use this here it will act in this                                 way you know and this can be reused for                                 these other purposes so real detailed                                 thought-out thoughtful documentation                                 throughout you know everything and and                                 that's true of designers as well I mean                                 you know we're all designers who any                                 designer who came out of the print world                                  you know as I did years ago is very                                  familiar with you know the brand                                  standards manual well you know I think                                  the brand standards manual is                                  essentially a thing of the past it's                                  kind of a an archaic way of looking at                                  things you have this sort of static                                  printed document that you disseminate                                  around but a brand standard site is a                                  much more sensible and an really                                  valuable document not just for not just                                  for the-- murs but and not just for                                  people who are who are who are                                  maintaining or building on to our                                  growing your site on an ongoing basis                                  but for all the people who are still                                  maintaining the standard that you know                                  the traditional printed assets of your                                  organization I mean if you're if you're                                  doesn't matter whether you're a                                  non-profit or a corporation you know                                  you're going to have printed materials                                  collateral at you that you send out to                                  people you're going to have training                                  materials you know you're going to have                                  all kinds of other assets that that are                                  there are digital assets that go                                  on with your brand and having all of                                  those things as well in a brand standard                                  site where any partner or any you know                                  or any you know branch office or our                                  other you know people who collaborate                                  with you can just go and quickly and                                  grab the assets that they need and have                                  permissions and roles to be able to get                                  into you know that brand standard site                                  and just and get that logo or I mean how                                  many times do not designers how many                                  times have you gotten an email from                                  somebody can you send me the logo you                                  know if you have a site where the logo                                  exists that task is now off your plate                                  you know they go they get the exact logo                                  they need in the format they needed                                  you've got it there in multiple                                  different formats and you know and                                  people can can can have a resource where                                  they can go to and constantly

                    theme as a theme for other sites which                                  is something that would that that we've                                  done you know you take a theme that                                  you've created for one site then you                                  know kelowna clone an entirely new site                                  from that so one with that well take                                  some questions                                  anybody                                  well first of all thanks guys great talk                                  the question that I had was in for                                  theming actually I use less CSS so it's                                  similar to compass and I try and use                                  stuff from Nicole Sullivan and the sort                                  of object-oriented CSS notion is that                                  something that you'll do an encompassing                                  functionality for a block to actually                                  enclose it in only one sort of ID                                  selector or that that kind of notion and                                  then have kind of have all your CSS                                  encapsulated within it well                                  I don't really understand question                                  exactly                                  like you mean like that certain style                                  should only apply within the blog                                  section well as sort of nesting                                  selectors inside sort of a global one                                  for that entity yeah you and you really                                  need to be sure that there are                                  absolutely no components on that page                                  that need to be used in a different                                  section of course I do think it                                  conflicts with the idea behind the                                  component silent because the idea is to                                  never                                  say this you never know when you might                                  need to reuse something so maybe you                                  aren't reusing it right now but maybe                                  it's kept redesigned just a little bit                                  so it can go on the web shop section as                                  well so I don't I don't think I'm                                  getting it across while I'm sorry                                  because I think it would support that                                  actually if it's this is how you                                  identify that component but it's just a                                  way of writing the CSS so it actually                                  isolates those selectors and they can't                                  kind of bleed out of that that styling                                  for that composite I think the part of                                  the components is that they can bleed                                  out once you would want that or once                                  someone who doesn't control the theme                                  but is doing things are adding things in                                  Backman that once he does that things                                  won't look like crap but nothing and if                                  you I so late that then there's no point                                  really in thinking components because                                  yeah once you've made them you you're                                  locking them so to speak you can't reuse                                  them in other sections of the site                                  thanks                                  all right parts the biggest problem                                  encounter so far is actually for                                  front-end FEMA coming in on a Drupal                                    project and converted to triple seven                                  for future expandability how would you                                  document a the theme for a full future                                  expandability                                  in suffice how would you itemized where                                  all the components the classes belong                                  within the CSS you give you a CSS cheat                                  off of two thousand lines how would you                                  easily summarize that an explainer                                  within the site all live in your style                                  guide for future front-end developer so                                  that their CSS is probably not well                                  structured or what really is that I mean                                  structure itself if you want something                                  to you easily go in there change in                                  image to another image how would you                                  easily explain that for another front                                  end developer coming in and taking the                                  project on maybe two years down the line                                  so i think i think i might be able to                                  answer these part of this because you                                  know that's one of the things that we                                  went through recently is upgrading you                                  know from from from d                                                     lot of times you really just need to                                  throw out a lot of that old CSS you know                                  and and and and and rewrite it you know                                  ideally hopefully you don't have to                                  throw away code that since but that                                  people have spent time on and and worked                                  hard on but but sometimes sometimes you                                  do and i but i think that you know if                                  it's well commented you know you know                                  right in the code itself that you know i                                  don't know whether you can talk to that                                  a little bit in terms of how you know                                  your processes for documentation or best                                  practices for documentation of CSS                                  stylesheets yellow I kind of see like                                  attempted that PHP with                                  a lot of repossessors and themed                                  functions they always have their typical                                  comment blocks about with just this                                  function does that and then the longer                                  description if necessary when I right                                  components I just have that the same                                  structure just blocks or components and                                  every blog has just a comment above it                                  just a small or big as it needs to and                                  particularly instructions for module                                  developers let me use it like that as                                  simple as possible but don't leave out                                  too much details for example with the I                                  need to document a component that is a                                  skip link or something then it's like                                  certain classes attached to it which                                  lean on maybe some helper classes like                                  in Drupal                                                               leans on element invisible so together                                  they make invisible links focusable with                                  a keyboard so things like that really                                  need to be documented                                  sister I really like what what would I                                  need when I were were a module developer                                  to use this it's really hard to explain                                  when I don't know what could exactly is                                  terrible                                  did that answer your question cuz it                                  does constituency yeah thank you                                  anything else                                  okay well there's no more questions that                                  I just want to thank everybody for                                  attending and enjoy the rest of the                                  drupalcon                                  you
