Brands grow organically and often undergo complete re-design. How do you prepare for change and build a scalable brand? Our session will show how, when you theme effectively, Drupal has the power to grow with a brand and make design changes simple.

We will talk about:

Tools and processes for envisioning the brand and the theme
Creating smart markup
Thinking in systems rather than 'pages', and building sustainable software
How the right tools can help you (CSS libraries, base themes, helper modules)
Finding balance between theoretical purity and practical solutions
Collaborating with themers, module developers and designers
Documenting the process and sharing assets
Intended audience
Experienced themers, module developers, designers, project managers.

Questions answered by this session
How to get more control over templates, and for instance, prevent tons of overrides when you have many views that require custom markup

How to make CSS systems (Or: why Drupal's HTML is actually awesome)

How do I 'design for Drupal'?

How can I use Drupal to manage brand assets?

How do I as a project manager, get the most out of my team?
