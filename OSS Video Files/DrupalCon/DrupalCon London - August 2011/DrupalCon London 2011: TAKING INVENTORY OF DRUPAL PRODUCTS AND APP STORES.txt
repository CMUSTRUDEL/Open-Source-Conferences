Title: DrupalCon London 2011: TAKING INVENTORY OF DRUPAL PRODUCTS AND APP STORES
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Robert Douglass
We now live in a world of Drupal products. The first "app store" was announced and launched, and more companies than ever are building (or want to be building) Drupal products. It's time to take a look and see what's working, and why. Who is succeeding with Drupal products, and what should newcomers to the market know and pay attention to for their products to succeed?

We'll be asking hard questions:

What products are doing well?
What ingredients make them succeed?
How does the GPL help us? Does it hold us back?
Are distributions and app stores the future of Drupal products?
What APIs and technology platforms are important?
Intended audience
C Types, business minded developers, analysts, and decisions makers of all stripes.

Questions answered by this session

	                              good afternoon everybody my name is                               robert douglas from Acquia and i'm here                               today to talk to you about taking                               inventory of drupal products and it was                               originally titled app stores but i'd                               like to redact the title of my session                               and make it marketplaces it's part of                               the shift in concepts that I'd like to                               convey today so it's been quite a week                                if I may say so in terms of                                announcements and press releases and                                blog posts I don't know if everybody's                                been following along closely but here                                are some of the titles we've seen                                recently so sub hub launches world's                                first Drupal powered App Store certainly                                written to raise a couple eyebrows and                                catch people's attention which it did                                aqua unveils apps market for Drupal the                                open app standard better usability                                Drupal wide open app standard now isn't                                that an interesting concept so a lots                                happened in the in the past couple weeks                                but actually things got started quite a                                while ago in terms of thinking about                                marketplaces app stores and whatnot so                                before we get into what all of those                                announcements mean and what it means to                                have an open apps standard and before I                                invite some guests to share the stage                                with me from phase two and sub hub and                                from aqua to explain some of these press                                releases and announcements I want to go                                through a little bit of history probably                                most of you saw some or all of it but                                just to give the rest of the whole                                conversation a little bit of context                                around what we're talking about when                                we're talking marketplaces why some of                                that might be important and how that                                might fit into your lives on a                                day-to-day basis as Drupal developers                                business owners Drupal users etc so last                                year at some point I had a conversation                                or a topic that I presented in Brussels                                at                                the dev days and i called it announcing                                the droopy App Store I used the hashtag                                Drupal App Store and what I what I                                learned was that that was a topic that a                                lot of people were quite interested in                                in fact have several of them had                                somewhat strong reactions to it                                emotionally it's fair to say that at one                                point it felt like it was going to                                unleash a worldwide Viking invasion and                                they were going to burn down cities some                                people even went as far as to say that                                you know the Drupal wars were starting                                so I appreciated this graphic                                unfortunately I didn't trace the credit                                on this one so it's uncredited but I                                think it's quite a great graphic so you                                know a little bit of a rabble rouser                                rabble rouser here it was it slightly                                intentional that it was inflammatory but                                the the whole thing started as a thought                                challenge for us to think as a community                                what does it mean to have an app store                                is it something we want and what it                                would look like and I think it actually                                after people got over the emotions that                                we've risen to the challenge quite                                splendidly and since then I've had the                                chance to talk about it in many contexts                                many drupal camps a drupalcon in chicago                                where Jeff Walpole and I shared the                                stage where he announced that phase two                                was actually launching an applications                                marketplace an app marketplace in the                                context of their distributions open                                public and whatnot so let me share with                                you some of the concepts that I've                                developed around this as I've talked                                about it in many places so that when we                                get around at the end of the session to                                talking about the open apps standard and                                what three different companies are doing                                about it and with it that you have some                                context how how the thinking goes and                                why it's important so backing way up and                                if some of you've seen these slides                                before we're going through them fairly                                quickly there there's a type of business                                that you can run where you essentially                                buy a product and you put it on your                                shelves and when somebody wants that you                                sell it to them for more money than you                                bought it it's a very good business                                 model i can highly                                 commend it doesn't work very well with                                 GPL code where you buy the code                                        these are called resellers you basically                                 take a product you don't alter it in any                                 way you resell it for more than you                                 bought it there's a variation on that                                 called the value-added reseller where                                 you take a product like a bunch of cut                                 flowers you put them into a bouquet put                                 a nice little ribbon on it may be a                                 wedding card or a funeral card or a                                 birthday card on it and you sell that so                                 you've added value to the actual product                                 you've added aesthetic you've packaged                                 them in a certain way that's called a                                 value-added reseller you can apply these                                 terms to the software industry as well                                 people take a product wrap it around                                 services may be combined products                                 together sell that their value added                                 resellers too and in fact in my view                                 most of what people do with drupal these                                 days and especially historically because                                 things are starting to change is act as                                 a value-added reseller you take a                                 software product Drupal you combine it                                 with some things that you download from                                 the internet such as modules maybe                                 themes you customize those maybe you                                 write some more modules you make a theme                                 you add value to it and then you resell                                 it and the customer that you're selling                                 to is what we typically know as a client                                 it's somebody who wants a website and                                 typically historically and still                                 probably the master vast majority of                                 people's business these days is being a                                 value-added reseller to people who want                                 web sites this is fine and by no means                                 what I encourage people to stop doing                                 that if that's what they're good at and                                 they're making a good business and we                                 definitely need people to do that going                                 on in the future so in by no means                                 always am I encouraging people that                                 that's a bad thing it's a good thing                                 however it does differ from the business                                 model of having a product something                                 that's self-contained something that you                                 can                                 put on the proverbial shelf somebody                                 walks in and gets the product they know                                 the product they know what it is they                                 know what they're getting you can define                                 it it's a whole thing in it of itself                                 they buy the product and use it now the                                 the good thing about a product like a                                 can of coke is that when you want a can                                 of coke on a hot day nobody has to get                                 out of bag of sugar add water and some                                 brown syrup put it in a tin can and hand                                 it to you it's there it's ready it's                                 done you know what it is they've                                 provided it and they can sell that can                                 of coke over and over and over again                                 because they've got factories producing                                 them out in the millions so the same is                                 true with software products I'm you can                                 think of a million examples Microsoft                                 Word made a couple people really rich                                 along the way because it was a product                                 that you could just duplicate at                                        to zero cost and sell over and over and                                 over again so software products have a                                 very valuable place in any software                                 ecosystem I think they have a valuable                                 place in the ecosystem Drupal as well                                 which is why I started talking about it                                 to begin with but my interests in the                                 matter actually have to do with these                                 people here now I'm of the opinion that                                 if you possess a development team like                                 that you can write any software you want                                 and it's going to be innovative and                                 great and it's going to be the best                                 software on earth right that is the best                                 development team ever assembled why                                 wouldn't we be the most innovative                                 product on the earth software-wise why                                 do we have any problem with velocity why                                 can't we get modules upgraded why can't                                 we get Drupal releases done faster I                                 mean there are all these complaints                                 about the velocity of Drupal it is what                                 it is we've got good velocity obviously                                 we're doing well in a lot of markets and                                 we're keeping up with the innovation                                 trend more or less but I believe we                                 could get more out of this development                                 team I think that if we managed them a                                 little bit differently then we'd                                 probably have better products that our                                 Drupal battle better modules and that we                                 would be more dominant and we'd start to                                 achieve more of greece's vision of                                 thinking big and becoming a dominant web                                 building platform for the entire                                 internet so why are not how are we                                 managing this development team                                 in ways that could be improved upon so                                 there are several ways first of all we                                 could stop encouraging them to work on a                                                                                                          many companies we have out there where                                 we sell the client essentially hours or                                 we sell them a fixed priced website                                 building project and we try and do it in                                 as small a number of hours as possible                                 so we have a margin left right those are                                 basically two variations of the same                                 thing where we either set the hourly                                 price in advance or we figure out what                                 the hourly price was once we you know                                 get paid for the work we've done in any                                 case that's not scalable you can't work                                                                                                     hours a day and you usually can't sell                                 the work product from a website building                                 engagement more than once the second                                 problem with how we're managing that                                 development team is that we're repeating                                 the same efforts over and over and over                                 again okay we're building websites that                                 for all purposes resemble each other in                                 a number of ways but in very few cases                                 we actually take that resemblance that                                 commonality abstract it take it make it                                 a product and just plug it into the next                                 website or better yet make it so that                                 everybody can plug it into every website                                 okay why is there no one single what you                                 see is what you can get editor we                                 haven't made it into a product why is                                 there no one single does everything that                                 you needed to image gallery we haven't                                 made it into a product so we're                                 repeating effort and every time we do                                 that we do it in a slightly different                                 way and it's inefficient now obviously                                 some things you need to customize for                                 every website and you're never going to                                 get around that and you're never going                                 to find a product that makes everybody's                                 dream website out of the box right                                 granted but there are things that we                                 happily standardize on and we forget                                 they exist like the log on box you might                                 theme it but it works the same way every                                 time right maybe hooks into your LDAP or                                 something and                                 it's got some customizations but that's                                 all within the product spec                                            the sites we build they've got the login                                 box and as long as they've applied                                 Vokoun look and feel they want to it                                 they forget it exists that's the example                                 of a product if we had to write the                                 login box over and over and over again                                 Drupal would have never turned taken off                                 we would have you know failed already                                 the next problem that I see with the way                                 that we're managing that amazing                                 development team is that we're                                 distracting our great minds so we have                                 so many people in the Drupal community                                 who think big already who think of great                                 products who think of abstracted                                 solutions to generic problems that would                                 help a lot of people okay but there are                                 very few amongst us actually if we look                                 at absolute numbers who can do what Jeff                                 eaten does and not only serve his                                 clients but then turn around and write                                 amazing tool kit modules or product                                 modules that he contributes to the                                 community not many people have that                                 stamina not many people are able to                                 actually fulfill their own expectations                                 of themselves for contributing back to                                 the community and writing all of the                                 innovative advancing ideas that they                                 have in their head so I believe that                                 that development team that we saw has a                                 large untapped potential for innovation                                 that we're not getting too because we're                                 distracting them with client work that's                                 repetitive and wasteful                                 so there's another reason that we want                                 to focus on products in the Drupal                                 community in my opinion oops wrong                                 direction and that is that if you have a                                 great product in an ecosystem it boosts                                 the whole ecosystem okay how many people                                 buy Apple products because the hardware                                 so great it's a great product so the                                 computer that I'm running I just love                                 the hardware how many people buy Apple                                 products because the software's great                                 right and then how many people move on                                 to other products because in the apple                                 ecosystem because they had this great                                 experience with one product you know                                 iPad users who then moved to mac OS x                                 iphone users who do the same people who                                 choose iphone over at Android because                                 they've already gotten a mac laptop                                 there are lots of examples of apple                                 products because of the greatness of one                                 product boosting the sales for other                                 products this it could be a great thing                                 for drupal but we are still sadly                                 lacking great drupal products in a lot                                 of areas now it's starting to change and                                 there are a number of companies several                                 of which are going to share the stage                                 with me in a moment who are actually                                 making great products and i think that                                 we're going to get a lot of the effects                                 that i just mentioned and hope for here                                 so there are other dangers though if you                                 don't make great products in your                                 ecosystem then you risk losing out okay                                 so i have an anecdotal story to tell you                                 there was a company that i've been                                 involved with as an advisor for the past                                 couple of years and that company has                                 always had a split focus on both web                                 services and development for wordpress                                 and web services and development for                                 drupal and when i started advising them                                 it coincided with a shift in their focus                                 towards drupal and they then went and                                 released a community module which                                 provided a great service to drupal and                                 that was a freemium model that was                                 supposed to draw people to their web                                 services didn't work out the way they                                 wanted to and they started looking at                                 other business models they thought well                                 you know one of the problems is we can't                                 really find enough money to invest in                                 the further development of our                                 our GPL module if we could only find a                                 way to actually pay the developers to                                 work on it more it could become greater                                 and then more people would use it and                                 more of those people would want to use                                 our web services but the web services                                 generation alone wasn't paying for the                                 development of the module so they they                                 post the hypothetical question on their                                 blog what if we started charging                                 everybody you know                                                    the download of this and used that money                                 for funding the development of it and                                 they basically got their heads cut off                                 by the Drupal community I mean gone                                 right there was it was pretty sharp                                 reaction that's not the way Drupal does                                 things the community won't stand for it                                 it's selfish it's not the way we do                                 things and so they said well okay will                                 do it for WordPress and they did they                                 did it for WordPress the developers                                 thanked them because then they could say                                 to their clients this is a supported                                 module by a actual professional                                 development company and came with a                                 support license and support forums and                                 an actual business model and the price                                 wasn't so big that in a                                 five-thousand-dollar site build it was                                 going to make any significant difference                                 and all of a sudden this company started                                 head having tens and then later hundreds                                 of thousands of dollars of sales of this                                 WordPress code which is basically just                                 like a drupal module based on GPL to                                 invest in WordPress development guess                                 what we lost out okay this is an area                                 where drupal could actually use a lot of                                 investment right now it's one of the hot                                 topics for us in what Drupal needs to                                 grow into it's one of the initiatives                                 for Drupal                                                          thousands of investment dollars that                                 could have been ours so that's what this                                 slide is about it's about not losing out                                 in finding sustainable development                                 models so that we can continue to invest                                 in Drupal development                                 so we're talking about selling stuff                                 let's talk a little bit about what is a                                 saleable asset for Drupal ok so we                                 identified a couple things when when and                                 Karen and I in the team were                                 brainstorming this so you can basically                                 sell usability if you can sell any sort                                 of convenience to the customer that                                 overcomes a pain point in Drupal we saw                                 it in Teresa's slide slides in the                                 keynote that people want Drupal to be                                 you easier to use if you can sell                                 something to them that simplifies the                                 website building process if you can give                                 them something then you can charge them                                 for it essentially is what I'm saying it                                 if you can solve any pain point in                                 Drupal then you can actually turn that                                 into a product that couldn't be for sale                                 you can take that money you can hire                                 more developers you can make Drupal                                 better how do you do that well distros                                 are a great example of doing that how                                 likely is a government agency going to                                 be to use Drupal if you tell them that                                 they have to go find the right modules                                 find out how to configure them theme                                 their site to look appropriate for a                                 government agency this could be                                 expensive build right it costs a lot of                                 money maybe they won't want to do that                                 how likely are they going to be if you                                 could say look there's open public it                                 was built for your use case it already                                 has a look and feel that's appropriate                                 for government and it's got some                                 targeted features that solve some of the                                 actual problems that you're trying to                                 solve around open data and profiles and                                 directories of people ways to collect                                 ideation and ideas from constituents                                 you've sold them already if you tell                                 them you can do that but you have to put                                 them together in modules no way so this                                 convenience ok that's another part of it                                 if I tell you you can build any                                 slideshow you want with Drupal if you                                 get views and you structure your data                                 the right way and you get the right                                 views plugins and you theme in the right                                 way so that they shift at the right                                 wrong to right time then you know some                                 of the developers in the room be like oh                                 that sounds like a nice challenge for a                                 weekend the rest of the people who are                                 just trying to get a slideshow on their                                 website of your pick no way but if you                                 can give them a downloadable app that                                 they just install and it does everything                                 you need configure the right way themed                                 the right way works out of the box                                 that's                                 venience and then there's a whole range                                 of stuff that you can sell around full                                 service okay this includes hosting this                                 includes consulting so there are lots of                                 things you can sell to people that you                                 can then use that money to pay your                                 bills invest back into Drupal hire more                                 developers around web services the                                 Mollom is a great example of that as                                 well as beauty nobody blocks these days                                 at the idea of selling a theme there are                                 dozens and dozens of stores on the web                                 selling themes for all major CMS's                                 including Drupal and they're making good                                 business so much business that a lot of                                 the joomla themes shops are now moving                                 into drupal space trying to replicate                                 the successful business that they had                                 for joomla for drupal think back to the                                 slide of the two guys running the race                                 and one of them losing the race if                                 joomla has a bunch of great professional                                 themes available and drupal doesn't                                 that's going to be one of the                                 differentiators for a lot of people who                                 are just looking to get a nice looking                                 site up so it's important to us that                                 these shops actually come in and provide                                 professional looking themes and we've                                 got a number of shops doing that and                                 finally one of the things that you can                                 sell to make people's lives easier about                                 Drupal's knowledge we've had that for a                                 long time we've had the Lola BOTS going                                 and doing trainings aquas got a training                                 program but what if you could deliver                                 that knowledge right into their website                                 experience right where they need it when                                 they need it right once you need a                                 delivery mechanism for that once you                                 want a billing mechanism to be able to                                 pay people who had paid content because                                 after all you do want to pay people for                                 your training content so that it's                                 really good nobody produces five hour                                 training videos at the best detail at                                 the best resolution at the best quality                                 with a lot of preparation for free some                                 people do but not on the topic you want                                 when you need it in the place you need                                 it so by paying people to provide the                                 services that we seek and need we                                 actually enable them to give them to us                                 okay so that's the context now we're                                 going to move into the bit of the                                 presentation where I start talking about                                 what's actually going on one of the                                 things that's going on and if you watch                                 the press releases if you watched aquas                                 website if you watch Twitter around the                                 matter you'd know that aquia has built                                 an API for their aqua network which is                                 now going to allow people to plug into                                 it and provide a number of services some                                 of them would be apps if you will and                                 we've done this we've been building it                                 for about a year and we plan to we've                                 now got some beta services that are                                 available to our customers now and by q                                  we want to make it generally available                                 public and looking at Chris Brookins to                                 make sure i'm not saying anything wrong                                 he'll start shaking his head if i do so                                 what would that provide so if you look                                 at the if you look at the graph I've got                                 here the Aqua network consists of our                                 support our cloud services and then                                 third party cloud services you've heard                                 of some of them before like Mollom                                 mobile Phi New Relic we've been                                 advertising that we have those for a                                 long time and those integrations were                                 basically one-off efforts you know we                                 work with the partner to figure out how                                 to get their services into our network                                 but what we've been able to do then from                                 that experience is generalize that we                                 know we want analytics and commerce                                 social media crm video and whatever                                 great idea is you're coming up with now                                 or in the future to offer we want to be                                 able to plug those in in a scalable way                                 and and let you know people offer these                                 to our customer base so the the services                                 that we provide in an aqua network                                 marketplace include things like listing                                 your product the ability to charge money                                 for your product and pass it on to you                                 the ability for you to interact with the                                 customer in some way                                 the things that you'd expect in a                                 marketplace                                 so some of the the new service that we                                 have we have a tool called blitz which                                 is a load slowed testing tool and this                                 is one of the beta versions or the early                                 adopter versions of the Aqua network API                                 that's going to be available later so                                 that's a great tool lets you set up a                                 load testing service for your website                                 and they've got a really great component                                 that I really like about it they let                                 there's a social component to the load                                 tests and I've been missing this in                                 Drupal for a long time if you if you                                 have                                                                Drupal website and they can compare                                 results that would be really interesting                                 like why is your site so much faster                                 than mine why is your site so much                                 slower than mine are they really that                                 different and they provide this that's                                 going to be really great and the the                                 other one that's not listed here is                                 Drupal eyes me that's a service that's a                                 website that exists built by the lolla                                 bots that's the home to their training                                 materials this is a subscription-based                                 service where you pay money to get                                 access to their great training materials                                 and starting immediately or in the near                                 future all of that material is going to                                 be available to customers of the Aqua                                 network so the important part of that is                                 that when we talk about a marketplace                                 we've already hit two really divergent                                 use cases one is a web service that                                 interacts with your website directly and                                 another one is a web service that                                 provides training materials to the end                                 customers so there are lots of different                                 ways that a marketplace can be used so                                 aquas built that we've been building it                                 for about a year and it's now going live                                 we've announced it it turns out that                                 there are a couple other companies that                                 are working on similar things and I'd                                 like to actually invite them to the                                 stage now                                 so we're going to bring up Karen                                 borchert from phase                                                   Rudovsky from sub hub and most weitzman                                 from aquia                                 and I'm inviting them to the stage in                                 the context of an initiative that has                                 grown out of the realization that a lot                                 of what a marketplace does and a lot of                                 what the marketplace has is is like                                 really similar from one instance to                                 another and it also comes from the                                 realization that if you're going to                                 build a marketplace you have great                                 incentive to make it the biggest market                                 place possible okay when you're a vendor                                 of a service or of a good then you want                                 to be able to sell it to the greatest                                 number of people possible so it's not                                 conceivable in Drupal at least at the                                 moment that there's going to be one                                 dominant market place like there is for                                 Apple I'm not even sure we want that                                 however we do see marketplaces emerging                                 so sub hub announced recently that they                                 have an app store and phase                                             in Chicago that they have an app store                                 and I can I've heard other people                                 talking about building some other things                                 and in a way drupal.org itself as an app                                 store or a marketplace so the                                 realization that there was the danger of                                 duplicating effort in five different                                 permutations that came the idea prompted                                 this group to come together and were                                 happy as a group to announce that there                                 is now a draft document about an open                                 appt standard that's been worked on and                                 now published on groups Triple DES org                                 the URLs at the bottom of the page so                                 the kind of the history of that so sub                                 hub was actually the first out of the                                 gate they launched their app store all                                 the way back in November of                                          they've got customers who are using that                                 and service providers using that phase                                 two back in Chicago in March announced                                 that and demonstrated that open public                                 was going to have an app store component                                 and that that would then become a                                 central part of all of their                                 distributions over time and then this                                 week och we announced that we to not                                 only have a marketplace for the Aqua                                 network but that in the future we                                 actually like to have something like                                 this Drupal gardens as well and that                                 we're joining the working group                                 for the open standard to participate in                                 it to you know show what we've learned                                 in building the Aqua network marketplace                                 and if possible to adopt it for drupal                                 gardens because we want the marketplace                                 to be as big as possible and as                                 inclusive as possible to give the people                                 who are going to sell things in it the                                 most incentive to be part of it and                                 that's very important so I'm going to                                 read the first bit from the open                                 standard draft and then I'm going to                                 turn the floor over to Karen Evan and                                 mosh so the goal and then we're going to                                 move to questions we've still got plenty                                 of time for that the goal for the open                                 app standard is to define the purpose                                 and high level components of an appt                                 infrastructure in Drupal and to define                                 the technical protocols required for the                                 creation use and distribution of apps in                                 the community and the larger marketplace                                 I think that's very carefully worded to                                 encapsulate and capture a lot of the                                 values and contexts that I try to convey                                 in the first part of the presentation so                                 I'm very happy then to turn it over to                                 my colleagues take it away sure hi                                 everyone big room so the two of the                                 members of the open app standard working                                 group that that you haven't heard about                                 yet in this session our phase two and                                 sub hub we've heard a lot about about                                 what aqua is doing so we'll just go                                 through a little bit about what were                                 what were each doing phase two we                                 specialize in Drupal distributions and                                 actually built apps as a module that was                                 a technical solution to a technical                                 problem an open source module we open                                 source a few weeks ago and built                                 documentation for building apps which                                 we'll talk a little bit about in a                                 minute but                                 the concept of apps itself we really                                 built as part of a distribution not to                                 launch an enormous war on App Store's or                                 the concept of app stores but actually                                 to solve the problem a usability problem                                 that people were having with our                                 distributions in Drupal and so that's                                 really the the history and like where we                                 came from at this towards this idea and                                 I'm going to let somehow can tell you                                 where they came from and then we'll                                 we'll take a look at what the apps or                                 supply so sub hub is maybe one of the                                 first companies to try to product size                                 Drupal in the way that Robert was                                 describing earlier kind of the coca-cola                                 model where we're trying to provision                                 thousands of websites to consumers to                                 individuals to small companies that are                                 very low price points and we're trying                                 to do that in an automated fashion while                                 also giving them the flexibility and the                                 control over what elements they                                 incorporate into their platform so for                                 us a nap model is really critical and                                 giving them that control but also making                                 it very modular and turnkey and                                 deliverable at high volumes and at low                                 transaction costs so that's really our                                 motivation for for being here and                                 participating and launching this kind of                                 solution                                 and this is actually a slightly blurry                                 picture of our App Store as it looks                                 today within our platform and you can                                 see a lot of similarities to app                                 implementations on other platforms and                                 it has many of the same kind of elements                                 apps are organized in various ways we                                 don't have a large enough quantity of                                 apps yet to organize them by category                                 but that will come and also users of                                 those apps can rate them and rank them                                 and write reviews of them so over the                                 time the marketplace helps to determine                                 which apps are most useful and most                                 successful                                 Thanks and this is the app store in this                                 is an open public so the apps that you                                 see here again you know easy to discover                                 and find read about see screenshots of                                 vote on up or down and then you know in                                 this case these are all open source open                                 source apps apps the modules themselves                                 are all are all open source and the                                 module itself the apps module that goes                                 into the distribution is open source as                                 well so it's you know again the the                                 concept of apps here that we're looking                                 at and the concept of an app market or                                 console or store is really you know it's                                 a very similar concept with a few                                 different implementations so I'm                                 together we in aquia these three                                 organizations came together and said                                 okay listen you know there's a lot of                                 these idea the word app flying around                                 let's get a conversation going in this                                 community about what this really is and                                 what it isn't and what it is intended to                                 be and help to develop something that                                 the community can agree on around the                                 concept of apps overall and then around                                 the concept of how those apps become                                 something useful in the marketplace in                                 the same way that themes have become                                 useful in the marketplace and training                                 has become useful in the marketplace as                                 a reasonable answer to a to a customer                                 need so we're going to talk a little bit                                 about what apps are and then we're going                                 to talk a little bit about what apps                                 aren't so we'll start with Evan                                 I get to do the positive one what our                                 apps basically they're meant to solve a                                 very specific problem they're meant to                                 contain a discreet bit of functionality                                 and be very easy to add to your website                                 without any technical skill required                                 that's part of improving usability as                                 well because if you can do that                                 obviously Drupal and the sites that are                                 the services that built on top of Drupal                                 become much more usable and                                 user-friendly at the same time it makes                                 it more usable for the developer                                 community it's a set of clear rules that                                 enable a developer to come along and and                                 write a discrete solution to a problem                                 and actually have that be very easily                                 deliverable across many many websites                                 all at once and similarly it also makes                                 it possible for companies and                                 organizations that are not part of the                                 Drupal community to build for Drupal                                 without having to get into the deep                                 detail of understanding Drupal so it                                 opens up Drupal too much wider audience                                 and much greater participation from                                 other enterprises and other                                 organizations that have services and                                 products to offer but need to do it in a                                 way that doesn't require them to figure                                 out Drupal first and then finally and                                 related to that point it facilitates a                                 Drupal economy so just as Robert was                                 saying earlier the example of the Drupal                                 solutions provider that ended up gives                                 me going to WordPress instead because                                 they found a more receptive economy that                                 enable them to make money we think this                                 is something that helps Drupal as well                                 because it creates a way for people to                                 build services and charge for them and                                 actually as a result of that facilitates                                 innovation and development of new                                 features and capabilities                                 motivated a bit by a profit motive which                                 is a good thing in our opinion now we'll                                 talk about what apps are what they're                                 not so earlier I said to these guys in                                 another room the best way I can describe                                 apps are convenience nuggets apps are                                 apps are really intended to be a                                 usability concept around functionality                                 in Drupal and what they're not is                                 intended to be something a way for                                 someone to go and immediately sell their                                 module just straight out it's not about                                 selling a module it's about providing a                                 layer of usability download configure                                 and find around functionality and Drupal                                 it could be one module or many so it's                                 not just a way to sell true cells it is                                 not a single at Drupal App Store to rule                                 them all it's not a push for a single                                 app store concept in Drupal that will                                 that will take over the the very                                 important part of that is the open                                 source community the most important part                                 drupal and it's not a plan to                                 commercialize Drupal or contract the                                 open source community and so again you                                 know where apps are coming from what we                                 care about in apps is the solution that                                 it creates in creating greater usability                                 in Drupal and and in what we where we                                 can go with that as a community you can                                 go to the next one                                 we'll try to kind of scoot through these                                 so people have time for questions okay                                 so why standardise obviously I mean the                                 reasons for standardizing are really                                 reasonable you don't want one person                                 saying you know hey MailChimp come and                                 build an app with us it's a Drupal app                                 and we'll put it in our and it will put                                 it in our App Store or our app market                                 and then have another company two weeks                                 later going hey MailChimp you want to                                 build a Drupal app not that kind of                                 Drupal app a different kind of Drupal                                 app that's where things get really                                 frustrating for third party service                                 providers and if there's one thing we                                 don't need Drupal to be anymore is                                 frustrated for any frustrating for                                 anyone else we want to make it easy so                                 interoperability between distributions                                 between SAS offerings between different                                 organizations is hugely key if somebody                                 builds a mailchimp app that can fit on                                 your distro and then on somebody else's                                 it's going to be more valuable to the                                 community overall and then best                                 practices and there are great ways to                                 package together functionality in a                                 usable way and there are not so great                                 ways and so standardizing around some                                 best practices there is something that                                 we'd really we really think is is a                                 value so we'll just go really quickly                                 through what the what the actual                                 standard is entails right now and do me                                 to do that or hear you okay so right now                                 there's a working group there's there's                                 three organizations in the working group                                 as of now but it's not a certainly not a                                 closed working group currently the                                 working group is all people who are are                                 doing or dealing with apps in some way                                 already the open app standard is in                                 draft on the group's drupal.org site for                                 open apps for the open app standard and                                 it is a draft it is here and ready for                                 comment question discussion and a forum                                 around that and then there will be                                 alongside that the ability to create                                 open documentation for apps built on the                                 open app standards                                 and the API how to plan and build for                                 them and then a manifest specification                                 as well so and then the last thing we                                 really see as an opportunity just going                                 back to that MailChimp example is that                                 those who are participating in the open                                 app standard can potentially go to                                 partners together and say you know hello                                 MailChimp we are                                                      have standardized around a simple                                 concept of usability in Drupal and we                                 want to build an app with you and that's                                 that that we think there's a lot of                                 strength in those numbers and so just                                 and finally how to get involved is you                                 know please join the discussion at                                 groupset drupal org and love it or hate                                 it we'd love for you to make your                                 opinion known bring your partners to the                                 table and understand what they need if                                 what they need is a usability and                                 solution and if what they need is                                 something that's more like a nap and                                 less like a customization may be worth                                 discussing building an app for it and                                 then start building apps is obviously                                 the the last one that we would really                                 encourage apps the module is out on on                                 do and documentation is coming out                                 around it thank you Karen Thank You Evan                                 so now I'm going to open the floor to                                 audience questions you can address them                                 to me speak nice and loudly so I hero                                 will repeat them and will keep all keep                                 our guests on stage so they can answer                                 to sir                                 so the question is how do abs differ                                 from features I mean stuff with us to                                 our take this to our technical team                                 member you thought you wouldn't get a                                 technical question and you did we're                                 calling in the back up so my name is                                 Eric summerfield I'm one of the                                 developers at phase two did a lot of the                                 work on the app's module so part of the                                 when you look at specification one of                                 the first things you see in the best                                 practices for making an app is it be                                 compliant so there's probably an                                 expectation that most apps will be                                 generated as features the apps part of                                 it is a lot more about these best                                 practices of combining those things                                 together and sort of finishing the                                 vision that dev seed started with                                 building the features module so                                 technically you know an apse of module                                 so like just just like people used to                                 ask what's the difference wien a feature                                 in a module and it's like I well it is a                                 module but it's a module that does this                                 extra stuff and an app is a feature that                                 does other stuff and allows us to                                 distribute it quickly and allow more                                 tions to third parties in that kind of                                 stuff so if I could then elaborate on                                 that you could imagine an app that would                                 deliver paid video content into the                                 website to give contextual help that                                 would be a type of an app that is module                                 delivered that's the technical level but                                 the product that's being delivered as                                 more of a training service so it doesn't                                 preclude those types so you had a second                                 question                                 so the question in short is how will the                                  commercialization of these apps change                                  the community well that's really hard to                                  predict and know therefore it's up to                                  the community to be involved and that's                                  why we call to you to be involved in the                                  standard that's why it's an open                                  standard and we'd like to hear your                                  opinions on that of course however one                                  thing that I do anticipate is that there                                  will be people drawn to the community                                  who weren't drawn to it before people                                  who might have written functional bits                                  that would be useful to Drupal but                                  aren't integrated now that's one effect                                  that I highly welcomed because I think                                  that will help us grow and help us be in                                  a more attractive offering for people to                                  use Drupal um I can take a crack at that                                  time but go ahead and the most most                                  hasn't had his voice heard yet okay                                  thanks you know for my perspective it's                                  a foregone conclusion that there's going                                  to be apps tours for Drupal all right so                                  you have to start from there and if you                                  agree with that premise then you want                                  app stores to be good for Drupal right                                  and to be done responsibly it's just                                  like sex happens and you want people to                                  have safe sex so you talk about it it's                                  a lot like that so what we've done here                                  is pretty remarkable you have                                  cooperation between three different                                  commercial entities in Drupal we                                  definitely compete at different parts of                                  Drupal yet we decided to work together                                  and we did it and we made an open appt                                  standard for drupal and and all of us                                  are making an open appt standard that's                                  something that Apple didn't feel a need                                  to do that's something that Google                                  didn't feel a need to do and lots of app                                  stores never have an open appt standard                                  and so I think you have evidence of the                                  Drupal community doing it in a Drupal                                  way already and you know if we can keep                                  talking about it and keep doing it in a                                  Drupal way then it's going to come out                                  strong in the end                                  thank you gentlemen in the front                                  so the question is how would you sell                                  software as a service product if the                                  basic component of the products are                                  modules okay so let's let's take a                                  little step backwards and look at the                                  people on stage and what they're                                  offering evan has a                                  software-as-a-service Drupal                                  installation as does Acquia Drupal                                  gardens in both cases that's the                                  software as a service product which the                                  end customer will never directly you                                  know install their modules on because it                                  makes it impossible to offer a                                  software-as-a-service product when you                                  open that up therefore we need a way to                                  get code from outside to the inside in a                                  controlled way so instead of giving the                                  end customer of the control to like use                                  FTP to move drupal code on to drupal                                  gardens we need a way to let them to                                  choose a product and a service from the                                  outside that they want that's met a                                  standard that has a standardized                                  delivery mechanism and then put that in                                  there now it could be that your software                                  is a service so note that we're not                                  selling Drupal gardens through the App                                  Store standard                                  I don't I don't I don't think we're                                  targeting go ahead Evan that's so that                                  that's basically the purpose of a                                  distribution and the purpose of a                                  distribution is to sell well are the                                  purpose of a distribution is kind of a                                  pre created type of website for a                                  specific use a marketplace for                                  distributions is not outside of the                                  realm of possibility but that's not what                                  it's not an app basically                                  what I would say is that at sub hub it's                                  kind of irrelevant to us whether or not                                  it's based on a module and we already                                  have examples of third-party software as                                  a service or service providers in our                                  apps or like MailChimp for example there                                  are others and basically in that context                                  the app is something that drives people                                  to them and then the customer then                                  purchases that service from that third                                  party and we get a cut so for us you                                  know the app is really just a way of                                  placing that third party presence within                                  our App Store and giving the customer                                  chance to purchase that service and                                  start by using a bit of that                                  functionality within the app to begin                                  with so I think there are lots of ways                                  that they can be implemented and lots of                                  motivations for creating an app the                                  module extension is one of them but it                                  could also be just driving people to use                                  additional services that are offered by                                  third parties Thank You Eva                                  so is the question is do we have to have                                  a software-as-a-service environment for                                  apps to succeed or are there other ways                                  if I understand the question right                                  you're asking could we actually like f                                  offer downloadable code right so I think                                  in the open public app store that                                  there's actually mechanism for fetching                                  code from a repository downloading and                                  installing it so I think that answers                                  the question they could be a                                  software-as-a-service or can be code                                  that you download                                  so is there a place planned where people                                  can add apps to sell them so the way                                  that this is constructed is that there                                  could be many places for that one place                                  will be the open public app store                                  another place will be the sub Hub app                                  store if Drupal Gardens moves to this                                  model then you would have a Drupal                                  Gardens marketplace app store that you                                  would be able to plug into and that's                                  everybody on stage has the intention for                                  making that place and what we're saying                                  is we see value in making the mechanism                                  for how to get into those places the                                  same so that we're not you know creating                                  those three different forms of video                                  cassette that I showed earlier and like                                  creating competing standards that make                                  it harder to integrate I mean Google                                  face is the same problem look at how                                  hard it was and still is for people to                                  write android apps for the android                                  phones just because the platform kept                                  changing so much every time good next                                  question user                                  that's a really great point that we                                  didn't address and that is the question                                  was how basically how do you curate the                                  offering so that falls and that's a                                  really important point but the beauty of                                  the standard is that it doesn't address                                  it okay right that's going to be                                  addressed by the individual app store                                  curators who run it and I'm sure at that                                  point the process for getting a nap in                                  Drupal gardens and having it curated                                  will be different than getting into sub                                  hub etc and that's up to the respective                                  maintained errs of the app marketplaces                                  themselves to be the curators for those                                  marketplaces and all of the technical                                  mechanism could be the same in all cases                                  the business terms and actual curation                                  process will most likely be divergent                                  yes sir                                  the question is doesn't this make it                                  more difficult to find the right app for                                  your business if you have to go to all                                  these marketplaces our hope is that you                                  could find the same apps in all three so                                  that if you download angry birds you                                  know you're going to be able to play                                  Angry Birds whether it's an iPhone or an                                  Android                                  so the question is doesn't having an                                  open appt standard seed differentiation                                  in the various products and to an extent                                  it does but the the growing the size of                                  the marketplace is far more urgent to us                                  none of us are big aqua is not big phase                                  two is not big okay the Drupal markets                                  not even as big as we need it to be to                                  really have a long future we need to                                  really be concerned much more about how                                  big the Drupal marketplaces and how                                  dominant is in the web content                                  management sphere we that's far more                                  pressing for us to solve then whether                                  we're beating each other over the heads                                  yes                                  yeah so what apps do you guys have Evan                                  oh sorry the question was concrete                                  examples of apps so Evan is running an                                  app store what's in it well we have apps                                  like MailChimp which has been cited a                                  lot as an example disqus is another one                                  so adding commenting to your web pages                                  there's a google search app to Google                                  Analytics apps sorry to add analytics to                                  your your site so again in our case it's                                  really just a way of giving people more                                  control over what they add and how they                                  configure their site by choosing a                                  supernap so those are some examples of                                  third parties and interview that's in a                                  few of those cases we've worked directly                                  with those companies to get the app                                  built and to get it integrated properly                                  and Karen what apps do you have in yours                                  we have an ideation app that creates a                                  place for constituents of a government                                  website to add ideas for what they want                                  to see in their world and then vote them                                  up and down and then an app called                                  project mapper that utilizes development                                  seats mattebox technology to map the                                  projects of an organization or of an                                  entity so you can show a map of all of                                  your offices or all of your or all of                                  your projects around the world for an                                  organization and again a good way to                                  think about an app is solving a very                                  specific problem for a very specific                                  audience                                  and I and I think that's that's the                                  that's that's what makes a good app is                                  something that solves one thing solves                                  it well sounds it completely and these                                  are also examples concrete examples that                                  are integration points for a marketplace                                  the Aqua network doesn't yet use the                                  open app standard maybe we will maybe                                  our experience running it will instruct                                  the open app standard that's yet to be                                  seen we've been working on it for a long                                  time it's already launched but in any                                  case the fundamental goal is going to be                                  the same user                                  of them                                  so the question is how how does                                  licensing fit into all of this so it's                                  an interesting question because there's                                  just like Therese head and his keynote                                  yin-yang sign showing the conflict                                  conflict between easy to use and                                  flexibility we have a conflict between                                  the benefits of open source which we're                                  all well versed in you know more                                  eyeballs on the court more people are                                  able to do it you can customize it it's                                  got a kind of almost an infectious                                  license so that if i distribute code                                  that I've based on GPL code it has to be                                  GPL that holds true so the apps and                                  karen's app store are all GPL they're                                  all hosted on drupal.org you can                                  download them there it's just a matter                                  of in this case convenience and                                  usability that you can actually find                                  them and install them from within your                                  web site experience and since they're                                  curated you know what you're getting you                                  have guarantees about the provenance of                                  source of that code and there are a lot                                  of value adds so there's no change in                                  when you distribute code there's no                                  change in the licensing that's                                  impossible for us legally we've got our                                  hands tied we can't escape the gravity                                  of the GPL nor would we want to so in                                  the cases where your model is to                                  distribute GPL code you have to find a                                  way to monetize around that and that                                  could include support contracts that can                                  include customization that can include                                  web services that call out to external                                  services that run code that you don't                                  distribute like Mala Mala Maz a                                  component that's a GPL module and a                                  bunch of servers that run a secret sauce                                  algorithm that protect your website did                                  they answer your question it's a very                                  important question and it was one of the                                  fundamental ones then last question                                  sure I can answer that question so Ben's                                  first question was do we have a                                  preconceived notion of the price ranges                                  of different apps and the second                                  question was and how will that revenue                                  be split so this is a really easy                                  question to answer because it once again                                  depends on which app store you're trying                                  to get it into okay are you trying to                                  get it into phase twos app store then                                  we'll talk to them okay trying to get in                                  the aquas marketplace talk to them                                  different business arrangements                                  I don't think you know I don't think I                                  can answer that question I think we have                                  time to go through that but I know that                                  for example a lot of the web services                                  that och we would like to offer will                                  range from you know free you get them as                                  part of the network when you subscribe                                  to it like most of the ones we have now                                  or possibly in the future the value-add                                  is so great that we don't have a                                  freemium model for or there's an upsell                                  from a freemium model where you then                                  would pay something usually predicated                                  on the external providers pricing more                                  to get that premium service an example                                  for that is mobile Phi the mobo Phi's                                  that you get when you subscribe to the                                  Aqua network you don't pay any extra for                                  that you just pay the subscription price                                  and you get something that is a tick                                  above their freemium offering so you                                  actually get better analytics and                                  statistics from your mobile I experience                                  than if you went to them directly but if                                  you want the full deal for mobile file                                  with all of their tools that they offer                                  then you pay them                                                        already different price point than your                                  five dollar example so and I've seen                                  other services you know think Salesforce                                  what do you pay for Salesforce right                                  what if sales force were in one of these                                  marketplaces hypothetical we don't have                                  plans for that I'm just saying that                                  their price points out there that are                                  interesting for the running of a Drupal                                  site that are way beyond five dollars                                  and the eventual splitting of that                                  revenue will definitely depend on which                                  partner you're talking to okay thank you                                  everybody for coming will be around for                                  more questions afterwards and thank you                                  to my guests for sharing the stage                                  you
