Description: 
	Presented by
Robert Douglass
We now live in a world of Drupal products. The first "app store" was announced and launched, and more companies than ever are building (or want to be building) Drupal products. It's time to take a look and see what's working, and why. Who is succeeding with Drupal products, and what should newcomers to the market know and pay attention to for their products to succeed?

We'll be asking hard questions:

What products are doing well?
What ingredients make them succeed?
How does the GPL help us? Does it hold us back?
Are distributions and app stores the future of Drupal products?
What APIs and technology platforms are important?
Intended audience
C Types, business minded developers, analysts, and decisions makers of all stripes.
