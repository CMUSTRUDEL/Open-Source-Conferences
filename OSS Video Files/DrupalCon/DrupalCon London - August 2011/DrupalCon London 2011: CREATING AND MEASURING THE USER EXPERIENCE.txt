Description: 
	Presented by
Jeff Noyes
This session will cover:

Methods to flush out requirements and uncover both good and bad ideas
Tools and methods to accelerate user interface design
Tools and methods to test designs for accuracy and measure for continued improvement
All of the above will provide you with tools and processies to ensure that you are both building to meet your customers needs by making informed design decisions, and getting better over time.

Flushing out requirements
Well look at several ways to get multiple stakeholders engaged and on the same page. We'll learn to quickly identify both good and bad ideas

Accelerating interface Design
Well look at tools, proceesies, and the roles needed to create both wireframes and visual designs in an expedited way

Testing for accuracy and measuring the user experience 
Well review many tools and processes used to test for effectiveness, and demonstrate methodologies that will ensure that each new feature or enhancement improves the experience.

In conclusion, I'll show some examples of how such tools and processes had a positive impact on business.

This session applies to people working in waterfall or agile methodologies, and applies to both website and web application design. It applies to business or product owners that are looking to increase traffic and adoption.

Last, the session will use Drupal and Drupal Gardens as the basis of this discussion.

Intended audience
Designers looking to learn to accelerate their artform Developers looking to include design, or some of it's user centered practices into their artform Business or product owners looking to build products that map to user needs and improve over time

Questions answered by this session
How can I make sure that my work improves the product I'm working on?

How can I weed out bad ideas and focus on good ones? What processes can I put into place to validate my thinking?

What tools can help me during the lifecycle of concept to creation?

How can I accelerate my design practice while including feedback from my peers and users?

	                              my name is Jeff I'm a user experience                               designer and and design manager I work                               for och weel as the slide suggests and                               I've been doing a user experience                               designed for about                                                     time my work has been focused on                               creating web applications versus                               websites so in those web applications                               it's largely role-based permissions                                based profile base so not unlike Drupal                                so Drupal was a was a pretty good fit in                                addition to being a user experience                                designer I'm also a design manager so I                                spent a lot of time working with                                companies building user experience                                departments and making sure that design                                and user experience fits with an                                engineering and product and marketing                                and in that time I've learned that                                selling design is is really hard and                                that most most of my customers albeit in                                in through the freelance world or                                through working for their different                                companies I worked for I've just learned                                that I've learned that customers have                                sort of expectations on design like they                                sort of think design is just brand the                                thing at the end that makes that makes                                pretty pictures or that makes a pretty                                interface that ties on to the end and so                                a lot of my work is trying to like                                convince them that's that's not                                necessarily the case and I think some of                                their some of the obstacles that I've                                hit is that they like I said they map                                design to something up to you know like                                a just visual design but additionally on                                top of that they see deliverables and                                user experience like usability testing                                and                                and they have preconceived notions and                                ask questions like why would I do                                usability testing when I have QA do i do                                I have to pay for both of those or why                                would I do design research because I've                                done the business analysis I've done the                                competitive analysis and because of that                                I can accurately represent the user so i                                don't really want to extend my timeline                                and pay for design research research or                                usability testing and so being a design                                manager is a lot of solving problems                                like that and and ultimately trying to                                avoid situations where you have                                interfaces like this so um you know I                                gotta you know as bad as this looks I                                got to give a few props back to                                Microsoft believe it or not I mean it                                took it takes a lot of work to build a                                UI like this you actually have to go in                                and and assemble all kinds of toolbars                                but the thing I find interesting about                                it is like if you look at all the                                redundancies in here I think you see                                things like the check box mod thing                                though check box will control here I                                think it probably shows up like three                                times you know so there's this they                                haven't done the work for solving the                                redundancies in the UI I know but I also                                think that even though this isn't the                                default out-of-the-box experience it                                paints a really good pitcher in terms of                                a general design rule which is you know                                try to focus on the eighty percent in                                this case you know using Microsoft Word                                you're eighty percent is to create a                                document bullets you know justification                                italics and so you're eighty percent is                                down here you know you type in this                                little tiny place versus your twenty                                percent is all this other stuff you know                                so it's it's it's exactly reverse of                                what you'd expect in a user interface                                but again props to Microsoft and the                                fact that most of the time they did lead                                with the eighty percent                                you none of these toolbars show on the                                surface so                                about about                                                            video that that NBC produced where they                                interviewed I do is everybody know I do                                company I do not many so I do is the                                company in Santa Clara California and                                you're probably all using I do products                                they are probably the most successful                                product design company in the world                                they've designed things like the wall                                they designed the original mouse they                                 also designed you remember the                                 toothpaste things there we always had to                                 screw on a cap of the to space and                                 always made a mess it well they designed                                 it so that you can stand a toothpaste                                 bottle straight up and the flip top cap                                 just general things and when I watch                                 this video I realized that the video                                 does an awful lot in terms of painting a                                 really great pitcher in terms of solving                                 the obstacles that I was having with                                 with my clients albeit in freelance or                                 through jobs they do a really good job                                 at showing the value of of creating an                                 end to end user experience process and                                 the thing that's interesting about them                                 is that they in this video they were                                 asked to do this and in five days time                                 and because they're so successful it's                                 really kind of hard hard to argue with                                 their design process so it's it's the                                 the video series itself is actually like                                 an hour along obviously i'm not going to                                 show you the whole thing i've cut it                                 down to its bare bones but if you're                                 interested in creating a culture that                                 that fosters innovation i highly suggest                                 you try to find this series and watch                                 the whole thing because it's just it's                                 just a brilliant video                                 here was the premise of the program we                                 went to idea of the product design folk                                 and said take something old and familiar                                 like say the shopping cart and                                 completely redesign it for us in just                                 five days nine in the morning day one                                 and these people have a deadline to meet                                 so welcome to the kickoff of the                                 shopping cart project this is palo alto                                 california in the heart of Silicon                                 Valley and these are designers that I do                                 probably the most influential product                                 development firm in the world we're kind                                 of experts on the process of how you                                 design stuff so we don't care if you                                 give us a toothbrush a toothpaste tube                                 abbr tractor a space shuttle you know a                                 chair it's all the same to us we like                                 want to figure out how to innovate in in                                 by using our process applying it and so                                 for the next five days the team will                                 apply that process to bringing the                                 supermarket shopping cart into the                                      century the team splits into groups to                                 find out firsthand what the people who                                 use make and repair shopping carts                                 really think okay go home of the placer                                 part is the wind catches it yeah and                                 these things have been clocked at                                    across the parking yeah that's actually                                 very good point the trick is to find                                 these real experts and so that you can                                 learn much more quickly than you could                                 buy just kind of doing in the normal way                                 and trying to learn about it yourself                                 from everything I read these things                                 aren't that safe either you know so                                 probably the seat itself is gonna have                                 to be redesigned what you're seeing here                                 is the kind of social science like                                 anthropologists you know like you go and                                 study tribes what is it that that they                                 do that we can learn from that will help                                 us design a better cart one of the                                 interesting things for me is looking at                                 how people really don't like to let go                                 of the cart except a bit professional                                 shopper whose strategy is to leave the                                 cart at various places each team is                                 going to demonstrate and communicate and                                 share everything that they've learned                                 today people went off into the four                                 corners of the earth and are coming back                                 with the golden keys to the                                 to innovation yeah shopping cart has                                 been clocked at                                                  traveling through a parking lot in the                                 wind here in the store went two hours                                 and and it was truly frightening just to                                 see the kind of stuff going up you ought                                 to designate some people to make damn                                 sure that the stores point of view is                                 represented after nine straight hours                                 the team is tired they call it a day day                                 two and the start of ideos unique brand                                 of brainstorming they call it a deep                                 dive a sort of total immersion in the                                 problem at hand ideos mantra for                                 innovation is written everywhere one                                 conversation at a time stay focused                                 encourage wild ideas defer judgment                                 build on the ideas of others that's the                                 hardest thing for people do is to                                 restrain themselves from criticizing an                                 idea so if anybody starts to nail an                                 idea they get the bill the deep dive                                 begins and for the next few hours the                                 ideas pour out and are posted on the                                 walls or the blind be the privacy blind                                 like when you're buying six cases of                                 condoms you know and see more nesting is                                 it sort of has to nest if it doesn't                                 nest we don't have a solution oh don't                                 throw pants and velcro seats for the

          ideas if then you'd build on those wild                                 wild ideas and end up being better ideas                                 than if you said if you if everybody                                 only came up with same things you know                                 kind of appropriate things you'd never                                 like have any points to take off to                                 build a really innovative idea good for                                 you honey tail was a nice kid it's now                                 organized um what it is is it's focused                                 chaos by                                                                 down for hundreds of ideas written or                                 drawn on the walls how by voting for                                 them vote with your post it not not with                                 an idea that's cool but with an idea                                 that's cool and buildable ok PA we're                                 done back up the shop it is six o'clock                                 the four mock-ups are ready for showing                                 baskets also Kennedy                                 think you will have more volume baskets                                 can be put in a modular shopping cart                                 you pile hand baskets on to thank you hi                                 tech cart that gets you through the                                 traffic jam a check out that you could                                 mount a scanner on the shopping cart so                                 you as the customer as you pull it off                                 the shelf with scan each item one that's                                 built around child safety and another                                 that lets shoppers talk to the                                 supermarket staff remotely uh yeah where                                 can I find a yogurt but the adults again                                 decide more work needs to be done before                                 the mock-ups can be combined into one                                 last prototype why don't we have all the                                 cards come up here for a second I think                                 you take a piece of each one of these                                 ideas and kind of back it off a little                                 bit and then put it in that yeah in the                                 design the design is still not there but                                 there's another motto at I do fail often                                 in order to succeed sooner some of the                                 team will be up half the night trying to                                 put together a design that finally does                                 work so so we took the best elements out                                 of each prototype designed this entire                                 cart in a day and then this cart was                                 fabricated in a day with an amazing team                                 of people in our machine shop pulling us                                 off working in shifts throughout the                                 night wow I'm impressed so are we the                                 cart which is designed to cost about the                                 same as today's carts is different in                                 every other way hand baskets that stack                                 in a metal frame and major improvements                                 for all you you just lift the handle up                                 you drop to put the children in and then                                 you can close the the handle right over                                 them and they instantly have some little                                 bit of a work surface that they can play                                 with what do you think well I'm very                                 proud of the team I think it's it's                                 great this does this work for you works                                 for me great it's all so beautiful I                                 mean lets you know take it over to a                                 local supermarket and see what they say                                 yeah works really well                                 the carts wheels turned                                                  could move sideways no more lifting up                                 the rear in a tight spot and you shop in                                 a totally different way rather than                                 taking a cod everywhere you go in the                                 store through a crowded store like this                                 much more efficient to take a small                                 basket rush around to where the tick the                                 shelves aren't come back and put the                                 back put them here treat this is like a                                 center for your shopping and with a                                 high-tech scanner so that in the future                                 you skip the checkout traffic jam that's                                 how you would scan an item reach over                                 and pick up anything like like the salad                                 dressing and I would I would scan it if                                 I want to accept that item I would just                                 press + and then drop it in my basket                                 because stores don't yet have those                                 high-tech scanners the team designed                                 checking out today means doing it the                                 old-fashioned way but the bags are hung                                 on hooks on the carts frame remember                                 there is no basket here why get rid of                                 the big basket the basket is tyranny the                                 basket is tyranny because it's not                                 really needed if all your stuff ends up                                 in bags why need the basket in the first                                 place it's me about theft                                 there's no value in this cart without                                 the basket because you can't carry                                 anything it's useless to anybody can't                                 there's a barbecue so it's not gonna get                                 stolen that's right so this all to                                 appeal to score on it yes i love it i                                 think it looks great at first I was a                                 little shocked but I think it's you have                                 some fantastic ideas here it needs a                                 little refining that I think that it's                                 great I mean we would we would want them                                 it makes me feel great and she also gave                                 us some really good comments about how                                 we can make this thing better so here's                                 why I like that number one they went out                                 and they basically assumed that I don't                                 I don't know what people who need                                 shopping carts need you know it if I was                                 to just tackle this without doing                                 contextual inquiry anything I might just                                 look at just shoppers and maybe                                 streamline the shopping cart but by                                 doing contextual inquiry they learned                                 that safety is a concern that speed                                 across these things across the parking                                 lot                                 cern that theft is a concern they                                 learned that the regular shopper which                                 is probably your default expectation and                                 if you were to do this itself is like                                 I'm just going to design us for the                                 shopper that that's not the only actor                                 that that there's that there's the store                                 owner there's the guy that pushes the                                 cart there's the shopper there's the                                 professional shopper in addition to that                                 they basically were able to brainstorm                                 on all different kinds of ideas really                                 rather rapidly and on top of that they                                 basically said a design is not good                                 enough I have to actually use it I have                                 to prototype it I have to play with it I                                 have to understand how it works and and                                 then after that they brought it to                                 market to see how that prototype                                 actually works which is pretty much a                                 user experience design process on the                                 web today now the other interesting                                 thing about this is that all of this                                 work was done in five days and not a                                 single ounce of money or on some her any                                 money was spent on manufacturing so they                                 now have a design that's completely                                 validated they know it works for their                                 target and nothing has been spent on                                 engineering which i think is just                                 phenomenal so there's a like I don't                                 know how old the study is I think it was                                                                                                    software fails and they basically said                                 something along the lines of overall                                   trillion dollars is spent on IT and of                                 that one trillion dollars fifteen                                 percent of all projects fail because of                                 a lack of requirements and on top of                                 that fifty percent of that is work                                 that's unavoidable and then last fixing                                 an error that happens after something                                 has been manufactured costs a hundred                                 times more than that as if it was found                                 a head of time and so these guys have                                 fixed all of those problems and                                 something that actually took                                 manufacturing you know like that I mean                                 they had machine presses and everything                                 to build that thing and so they've                                 solved all of these problems and if we                                 can do that on the web imagine how much                                 we could actually save so this statement                                 seems so obvious it's written by Whitney                                 hesketh happy cog who is a really                                 wonderful interaction designer that                                 basically says to find the right                                 solution the how we need to prioritize                                 the features we invest in the what and                                 to determine our priorities we need to                                 define the problem the why and to define                                 the problem we need to identify the                                 intended audience which read backwards                                 means you pretty much have to know who                                 you're designing for in order to                                 understand what their problems are in                                 order to come up with solutions to those                                 problems in order to execute against                                 them and despite how elementary that                                 sounds I see over and over and over and                                 over and over and over and over again                                 people that cannot do this so let's                                 transition a little bit into the web and                                 the types of things we're doing it aquia                                 to try to I guess not all of us is a                                 tech way but it's the things that I                                 advocate for and try to do some of this                                 stuff doesn't quite make sense in Okwe                                 but I've included it because different                                 products may require this more so than                                 ours so identifying the who and why                                 who's using your software and what                                 problems are they having or why do they                                 need a solution the first one is pretty                                 much what we saw and in the video which                                 is contextual inquiry it was I think the                                 video is a little dark I couldn't tell                                 from where I was standing was one of the                                 where they headed and in the quad                                 section and it's basically field                                 researchers that I rooted in ethnography                                 or anthropology that that go out and                                 observe people and try to understand                                 what their natural behaviors are it's                                 really good for flushing out the Y or in                                 the case of the shopping cart we can                                 just go to the shopping go to or grocery                                 store also understand you know                                 who who's using it and what problems are                                 they are they facing in terms of the                                 cost may not depends it depends on                                 whether you're going to do this yourself                                 and just go and observe or but basically                                 it comes down to you know something like                                 it's some moderator or a field                                 researcher they'll see up above I have                                 one to two moderators and if it's if you                                 have to compensate the participant it's                                 you know                                                         compensate them again in the case of the                                 other grocery store there is no                                 compensation you just got to go there                                 and observe and figure out how people                                 are shopping surveys kind of goes                                 without saying but us you know surveys                                 are another way to kind of reveal why                                 people are having problems on on your                                 site it's not you know even though I say                                 it's good for flushing out who it's it's                                 not the best for flushing out who but if                                 you do lead your surveys with things                                 like you know what what's your primary                                 role then you may learn through doing a                                 survey of your software that maybe who's                                 using your software is different than                                 you expected I've listed on the side                                 this whole presentation is kind of                                 format it this way there's these                                 different services or tools that I use                                 some of them I know a little bit more of                                 than others some of them I actually                                 learned through creating this                                 presentation and the ones on the you                                 know with arrows pointing to them a                                 tools that I use or we use regularly so                                 gufu and SurveyMonkey have been around                                 for a long time you probably know what                                 those they just good survey with a lot                                 of good analysis Drupal Gardens has web                                 forms built into it so that's also                                 really good for doing some basic surveys                                 the analysis needs to come up to the                                 other tools but still                                 still good good things zoomerang is a                                 lot like a lot like wolf ooh or                                 SurveyMonkey except i think they give                                 you two more questions for free over a                                 wolf oops like wolf will you get                                    questions a hundred response for free                                 versus zoomerang get                                                  response interviews are probably my                                 favorite method of coming up with an                                 interface since basically it's just a                                 one-on-one one-on-one interview with the                                 experts of your of the the problem that                                 you're trying to solve so how many of                                 you guys have used views three yeah so                                 views three was a good portion of it was                                 my design and the way that I did that                                 was it was actually one of my favorite                                 recent projects just because working for                                 aqua we have we have a staff of people                                 that train people in Drupal we have a                                 staff of people that help people with                                 their problems and we also have a staff                                 of people that kind of go on scene and                                 you know get people you know up to up                                 and running on these things so I had                                 experts all around me on this views                                 project and so it's really just sitting                                 with them learning about their problems                                 learning about their desires and you                                 know taking all that analysis and                                 blowing it up and be like okay well                                 eighty percent of the people wanted                                 these particular features and therefore                                 that's that's what we're going to build                                 unfortunately there's no services or                                 tools it's just a matter of you know                                 using your time to to schedule it and                                 make it happen                                 usability tests so I'll cover this more                                 later when we get down and start talking                                 about the what and coming up with ideas                                 but it's basically just if you have a                                 product already it's really just you                                 know asking people to go through your                                 product and understanding where the pain                                 points are those products there's two                                 different types of tests which I college                                 I'll cover more later too which is                                 moderated versus self moderated and then                                 there's actually a third one called                                 static self moderated and then of course                                 is analytics right probably everybody's                                 using analytics if you're on the web you                                 know some of the popular ones Google                                 Analytics which is probably what most                                 people use but crazy egg is another                                 another really interesting tool crazy                                 what crazy does is it has it has a bunch                                 of different things with the two things                                 that I think are most interesting about                                 crazy egg is it provides heat maps that                                 show where are people clicking and where                                 they scrolling are they actually                                 scrolling all the way down and or not                                 and missing important content but where                                 it gets really interesting is it                                 understands the data that's coming to                                 the site so if you searched let's say                                 you are using aqua calm as an example if                                 you had crazy egg installed and somebody                                 came to aqua calm and had searched for a                                 Drupal well it'll provide a heat map                                 that's based on that search criteria so                                 you can see where people are clicking                                 based on that search versus if they had                                 come into aqua using yahoo and searched                                 you on CMS or something maybe they're                                 the same clicks maybe there maybe                                 they're not the same I guess one thing                                 to note about analytics is a lot of                                 people pay an awful lot attention to two                                 unique page views which you know                                 obviously can tell you some things but                                 there's there's things that you get a                                 walk you out there watch out for there                                 too and that just because your site                                 bumps up and you're getting more traffic                                 it doesn't necessarily                                 you know translate to exactly maybe what                                 you wanted I think there's a lot of work                                 to define the metrics that you want to                                 use in your site so for example again                                 Paige spikes that page spikes doesn't                                 necessarily mean what you wanted to                                 maybe if your do if maybe if you look                                 for number of comments or something like                                 that that could tell you a little bit                                 more about loyalty or a number of                                 comments by by the same user I could                                 tell you a little bit more about loyalty                                 too and then there's other things that                                 come into question like what's more                                 valuable somebody that comes to your                                 site every single day for                                               somebody that comes to your site for                                 four hours and leaves and goes and tells                                 all his friends about about about the                                 about the product that latter one you're                                 not going to be able to get through                                 analytics so if you're going to use                                 analytics a lot of these other things                                 come into play to like you may get that                                 information through a usability tests                                 where they get done doing it some tests                                 and they're so ecstatic about the                                 product and they maybe they tell you I'm                                 going to go tell everybody about this so                                 analytics is only one form of method to                                 kind of understand what problems might                                 you have on your site                                 oops I lost my control here                                 so what you know now we now we know who                                 is using our product and what problem or                                 why they're having problems why there's                                 a need to to do anything here now we                                 kind of got to understand what are we                                 going to do for them what's what's the                                 process of arriving at various different                                 solutions one way that we use is using                                 design principles and a design principle                                 is sort of a guardrail to the design                                 process so I've listed aquos design                                 principles on the right here these are                                 from yeah they're differ much every                                 product I was going to say they're                                 mostly for drupal gardens but negative                                 for every product and so you know a                                 really good example is let's say you're                                 trying to figure out whether you want to                                 add a feature or or not you got a couple                                 people on opposing sides I you know I                                 think our users need those I think they                                 don't need them so you're not really                                 sure that's probably a case for them to                                 use it but not a hundred percent                                 positive and so you can have a design                                 principle that says when in doubt go                                 without right so that doesn't you know                                 if you were to look at your personas                                 that doesn't tell you you mean your                                 personas it doesn't answer that question                                 but a design principle does so a good                                 solid set of design principles is really                                 helpful to kind of keep a experience                                 creation process going in the right                                 direction I'm really just scratching the                                 surface here there's a if you google                                 design principles by Jeremy Keith he                                 does a just a fantastic job it's talking                                 about what's what goes into a design                                 principle and how they work and                                 if he's got like an hour long session                                 just on design principles                                 so ideation one of the things just to                                 point it out I've got this little                                 accelerate tag at the top and so the                                 point of that is that I think there's                                 ways that that we can accelerate design                                 which also addresses some of the                                 concerns up front about selling design                                 and some of the misleading facts about                                 design I think that if we can accelerate                                 and get faster than we don't have to                                 answer the questions of why do we you                                 know or respond to the cutting of                                 usability or cutting a design research                                 because they're too expensive so if we                                 can accelerate and get faster than you                                 know obviously the whole entire design                                 process is going to get cheaper so what                                 ideation is is very similar to what I do                                 did in the beginning where they did the                                 contextual research they know their now                                 they know who and who and why and                                 they're all kind of getting together in                                 brainstorming and coming up with a                                 solution that potentially works the way                                 we've done it in the past is we create a                                 we create a design brief which is sort                                 of a loaded word that sounds a little                                 scary a lot of people when you think a                                 design brief you think                                                  that's not what this is this is um maybe                                 two paragraphs outlining the problem                                 that you're trying to you're trying to                                 get to and and then you you go around                                 you have you bring in all the                                 stakeholders that matter if it's if it's                                 a whole bunch maybe you get to do a                                 bunch of these series or maybe that the                                 duration is a little bit longer we try                                 to keep these to an hour and at an hour                                 we've found that six participants is the                                 max that we can hold in an hour and the                                 way that it works is everybody has this                                 design brief and all the people that are                                 involved in the room are asked to sketch                                 a solution to the problem and after they                                 sketch a solution to the problem they                                 they have to present it say this is                                 usually the sketch eat I mean you don't                                 have to go be a good drawer in fact most                                 of the sketches that come out are hardly                                 even legible but they at least give you                                 points that you can talk to and so they                                 present their designs and and after                                 they've presented everybody in the room                                 goes around and critiques that design                                 they give three positives and three                                 negatives and then at the end of that                                 you have a document that that looks                                 something like this                                 so I know it might be hard to read but I                                 kind of walked through it so you know at                                 one point time we had this problem in                                 that Drupal Gardens team builder where                                 width and height we put that in there to                                 control the divs and change the columns                                 of things and it was causing all kinds                                 of problems and so we had a design brief                                 that said you know we need to fix the                                 design who we need to fix the width and                                 height but it's not a process of                                 removing it what's the solution that we                                 would actually do to put it in and so                                 this is only a subset of the people that                                 participated but it and everybody went                                 around the room sketched just as I said                                 and and as they critiqued the person                                 that did the design is inside of a                                 Google Doc capturing the feedback from                                 other people and as soon as you hear                                 something that two people liked it gets                                 an additional tick etc etc so it looks                                 like the colors are a little off here I                                 can't really tell from my perspective                                 but you know I did I did this just for                                 this presentation but what I did was                                 outline all of the issues that nobody                                 liked and all the issues that people did                                 like and the great thing about that is                                 you know when you leave that you can at                                 least know that you're designing                                 something that's not going to the stuff                                 that it's just not going to go anywhere                                 because nobody none of the stakeholders                                 liked it you may go an entirely                                 different direction but at least you're                                 not going down that pitfall of coming up                                 with designs it gets the things that                                 nobody's going to nobody's going to buy                                 off on in the end                                 so task flows I actually thought about                                 omitting this slide they're kinda mean                                 they've been around for a long time but                                 the reason why I mean I don't do them                                 anymore but there is reason why I don't                                 is because mostly I'm working within a                                 predefined system for example views                                 doesn't really need task flows however                                 when we started doing Drupal Gardens the                                 whole process of registration and how                                 you know understanding all the touch                                 points or registration those had tasks                                 those and that's really the main point                                 of a task flow is to is to understand                                 the site at the                                                         you were to like think of you know an                                 analogy of Google Maps you know you the                                 u.s. boundary with all the different                                 states might be a page flow it doesn't                                 give any details it's just really kind                                 of talking about you know the high level                                 stuff you know some of the tools that                                 have been around forever things like                                 illustrator and visio of PowerPoint but                                 lately there's been services coming out                                 like Kaku I think it's how you pronounce                                 it lucid chart and mine master I think                                 they're probably you know better than                                 the old school tools like illustrator a                                 vizio because they're immediately online                                 and everybody can kind of collaborate in                                 terms of what what what that task flow                                 is outlining                                 this is an example of a task flow I did                                 probably like I don't know                                              and it's just a furniture exchange                                 connecting manufacturers and                                 distributors and it's for a given use                                 case and my point was to figure out all                                 the pages that were going to be involved                                 and and then kind of break out I even                                 started getting to this wire frame to                                 understand what that might look like                                 once you know once it once i actually                                 did get to this phase                                 grey boxing i think is is kind of a new                                 term that's popping up it's and my mind                                 is not any different in a wireframe                                 except it's it's it's a conceptual                                 wireframe it's just kind of looking at a                                 specific page and trying to figure out                                 what are the big areas that are                                 important and you know you're using them                                 too if you have a customer and you don't                                 really want to get down into the weeds                                 and have them you know you know                                 critiquing what a specific link says or                                 where a specific link falls or the                                 structure of a table it's that's what                                 it's for us to kind of say you know                                 these you know just look at the page and                                 and you know try to get a general sense                                 of what it is this is a gray box that                                 was produced by floor from chapter                                       in my mind it's actually this is                                 actually a little close too close to a                                 wireframe if this was my idea of a gray                                 box they'll you know the navigation at                                 the top there wouldn't have been broken                                 up into into five buckets because then                                 you're starting to make connections like                                 oh are you only saying that I'm going to                                 have five links up there instead I think                                 it's better if it's just a single bar                                 that says this is navigation                                 additionally you get into these things                                 right here where it says like block                                 header you know and kind of gives it                                 pitcher in the details and that kind of                                 creates questions like well what kind of                                 imagery we're going to put in there or                                 why does it say block header if this was                                 my gray box it probably would have just                                 been you know a feature goes here a                                 feature goes there this would be content                                 that's the primary area for displaying                                 you know your major featured content and                                 what it does is it allows the you know                                 the customer to to at least understand                                 what your where your head is at in terms                                 of how things are going to be placed you                                 know where is my logo going to go etc                                 storyboards storyboards are sort of my                                 sweet spot and I think they're they're                                 different than a wireframe in that a                                 wireframe by nature or by definition if                                 you were to look at wikipedia a                                 wireframe is a is a black and white                                 skeleton of a site or a UI and a                                 storyboard in my mind can be that if it                                 wants to be but more importantly it's                                 sort of representative of the end state                                 and I think we haven't seen storyboards                                 around an interface design largely                                 because of the tools that are available                                 to us or the historical perspective of                                 the tools that are that were available                                 to us so for example in in                                          Norman coined the term user experience                                 so that was what sixteen years ago my                                 math is not all that good sixteen years                                 ago so the industry is really you know                                 young and                                                            think about you know this user                                 experience space that is blossomed into                                 what it is now                                 back then there were just a couple tools                                 available to you probably illustrator                                 Vizio and photoshop right and you know                                 when you're working with a customer you                                 need to iterate as fast as possible to                                 just turn through the turn through the                                 different designs and if you were to use                                 Photoshop to do that I mean you just                                 might as well just kill yourself you                                 know it's like though just to take way                                 too long but you know fast forward to                                                                                                          can produce designs that are that look                                 exactly like the the end state but at                                 the speed of Vizio or illustrator and so                                 I kind of think the reason why we do                                 these black-and-white designs is as just                                 based on history but you know that I try                                 to move my department away from that so                                 that you're doing visual designs and                                 interaction designs at the same time or                                 at least you have that choice to do that                                 so this lost my thought there but as                                 kind of an example so I've got this                                 little test for you so which tests and                                 sells better and so what I mean by that                                 is that by test better I mean if I was                                 to put this design in front of you and                                 ask you to use it                                 how well do you think it would test by                                 cells better what I mean is if you are                                 my customer and I'm trying to present                                 this UI back to you which one of these                                 designs are you going to get excited                                 about which one are you going to                                 probably sign off on and say yes take                                 that to the next level oh I lost my I                                 lost my connection here                                 the Wi-Fi in this conference is out of                                 control                                 okay so based on that now that you know                                 what would I mean by tests better sells                                 better tell me which one of these you                                 think tests better ourselves better a B                                 they're all the same design just                                 different different levels of fidelity                                 or C                                 I mean it's sort of rhetorical question                                 in this case right if I put a paper                                 napkin in front of a customer or end                                 user and I have done that a lot of times                                 they look at you like you're smoking                                 crack you know like what do you mean you                                 want me to test a napkin you know this                                 versus if I put something like this in                                 front of them they at least make the                                 connection that this is an interface and                                 that you know you want me to do                                 something in this in this space and so                                 you know because it's a rhetorical                                 question it doesn't have a lot of value                                 but bringing her back to what I was                                 saying you know now let's ask that same                                 question in terms of which one of these                                 do you think is faster to produce a                                 be                                 or see                                 I'm interested                                 B&BS fastest is that the general                                 consensus                                 yeah see is fastest                                 yeah which one was that all right so                                 answer both of those c is fastest i was                                 able to produce that in a bit probably a                                 fifty percent faster rate than i was                                 able to produce be a may have been                                 faster if it was truly a napkin sketch                                 that i sketched that I'd scanned into                                 the computer or something but that's not                                 what i did i actually had a walk-up                                 tablet and i was trying to draw this and                                 i had to push them down hard to make it                                 like show up and so so you know if you                                 can do this at the speed that you can do                                 those other ones then why would why                                 would you do a wire frame and before i                                 come back to your question claudio it                                 was Claudia all right yes some people                                 may say yeah but it's black and white                                 Jeff of you know that's we're not even                                 talking about the same space here but                                 this is a wireframe too right it's                                 completely in in the end state it's a                                 hundred percent vector-based outside of                                 a few objects like these are some                                    rendered files that were pulled into the                                 vector based file that allows you to                                 still you know take this guy here and                                 scale it and change the text and                                 whatever so it's it's pretty much just a                                 wireframe except in its end state and                                 when I present ideas like that my                                 customers get excited right they're not                                 looking at a black and white thing and                                 they have to somehow meant mentally map                                 that to what it's going to be                                 additionally I don't you know if I don't                                 want to go to my customers first if I                                 want to prove out the design i can                                 actually go and test this with users and                                 then go back to my customer and say                                 guess what you know this is the design                                 and guess what it tested really well in                                 terms of maintaining c is still easier                                 to maintain as long as you're using the                                 right tools there's ways to create                                 symbols and so you know i use fireworks                                 for a tool to create all these things                                 and i'm constantly in drupal so the way                                 that the way that it works for me is                                 actually i'm constantly in drupal and                                 going back and forth between this site                                 even though this is a little bit of an                                 older design and so what I've done is                                 I've created libraries of things like                                 I've got a seven you know the Drupal                                 admin theme is called seven so I've got                                 a                                                                     said I've got a seven you know overlay                                 admin so for me it's just a matter of                                 taking the fields and dragging them on                                 so so let me stop for a moment and and                                 show you an example of the views project                                 so this is um you see that you know so                                 this is a storyboard of views and                                 basically the way that I map all these                                 storyboards is for something as complex                                 as as views that has I don't even know                                 how many use cases in it what I what I                                 try to do is first map the general flow                                 of of the eighty percent case through                                 the tool which I'm not actually doing                                  right here at this moment but you know                                  for example i want i want to create the                                  view i want to show what's a good                                  example i want to show just blogs i want                                  to create a page of the blogs i want to                                  show the blogs as teasers as well as i                                  want to create a block of titles and be                                  done right that's a that's a pretty                                  common case or maybe i'm not quite done                                  but i want to tweak that view and add                                  some add some various fields to it                                  that's kind of the common case and then                                  you get into edge cases like I want to                                  configure a table wizard I want to add                                  relationships i want to add arguments                                  you know all the different edge cases                                  and so when you look at a file of mine I                                  have it I have it broken up that way so                                  you have a main main flow through the                                  through the file and then the various                                  edge cases and all of these are listed                                  in one file so let's get to the so                                  here's your list of views I've got some                                  spec stuff on the edge to just so that                                  it can actually go over to a module                                  maintainer and they can execute on                                  against it how you could if you browse                                  different code based views select the                                  codebase view this is your creation                                  process this is what it looks like you                                  know on the surface let's look like they                                  were a reversal of it but if you say                                  you're going to create a page so you                                  kind of like you're showing a sequence                                  of events through through a different                                  product                                  different contextual fields what it                                  looks like when you get into the view                                  and just kind of see if I can screw this                                  up on a Mac                                  I want this one right so you know this                                  file what it looks like is                                  I've got them in Jesus I can't drag it                                  I'm lost without a mouse                                  so I've got these different states you                                  know I've got the main flow I've got                                  other views you know table settings of                                  what it looks like with the mastic query                                  what you know how to filters all work                                  out of the filters and or you eyes work                                  all of which are certain task flows                                  flows and then when you drive into a                                  specific page so all of these are pages                                  a page has many different states so                                  these are the ones that i was walking                                  you through all the different states and                                  this is this is how i create storyboards                                  and the interesting thing about this too                                  is that these are all ping based files                                  so what i could do is just export this                                  and they'd be immediately ready for                                  consumption in a web-based prototyping                                  tool which i'm going to talk about in a                                  moment to additionally i got that same                                  Wi-Fi issue again sorry additionally if                                  every now and then I get stinks every                                  now and then I get somebody who sends me                                  wireframes or design mockups of                                  Photoshop and I'm instantly like                                  flashback like                                                            a zipped up file and as if the file is                                  like                                                                      inside the                                                            wireframes and I'm like to                                  this file which has I don't know                                  probably something like                                                   in it it's its base file is probably                                  something like eight mix so i can send                                  this file around to a bunch of other                                  people and it does it's not all that                                  taxing another example rather heist if i                                  go back to my own maybe i should do that                                  just because so another example here is                                  this idea of a marketplace so aqua has                                  been toying around with building this                                  theme marketplace or template                                  marketplace and and so these are some                                  storyboards for for those and note that                                  there's a slight difference here and                                  that the in this case I've consciously                                  decided that I don't want to worry about                                  brand I don't want my viewer to be                                  asking me you know why do the stars look                                  like they do why do you know why why are                                  the links that color or stuff like that                                  so I tried to strip it down to the to                                  the wireframe approach but I still                                  consider this a storyboard because it's                                  still task-based and from this wire                                  frame i can i can scale up to i can                                  scale up to the final you know finished                                  results really quickly and what i mean                                  by that is even though this is a                                  wireframe mode I can come over to this                                  this style guide that we have here which                                  has everything in here and let's say I                                  wanted to just start to upgrade my                                  upgrade the skin thing really quickly I                                  can just paste attributes really fast                                  maybe I don't want that one who don't                                  want links                                  right so everything just automatically                                  comes up to a wireframe like I can even                                  small T select yep and they all get                                  adapted really quickly take all these                                  things and just you know really quickly                                  I'm able to take this wire frame that                                  I'd used solely for the purpose of                                  stripping out this final result but in a                                  matter of an hour I can roll this up to                                  so maybe probably even under an hour I                                  can roll it up to look something like                                  that so that's kind of how i                                  differentiate wireframes and storyboards                                  is that it's it's primarily you know                                  task-based you gets a sequence of events                                  unlike a wireframe you can't really it's                                  not really a great tool to show how                                  transitions work and transitions are                                  becoming a part of everyday web design                                  you with things like jQuery if you were                                  to kind of show what drag and drop might                                  look like and and a black and white wire                                  frame it's not really helpful especially                                  from a user testing perspective                                  okay so the next one prototypes so you                                  know one of the things that we can do                                  from a storyboard like that is export                                  all the different states and because                                  they're sequential you expect that you                                  know you can just click and you can in                                  and if you're going to be if your plan                                  is to do usability testing you can map                                  out these tasks and have those tasks                                  work to those master flows export them                                  out and then use some of these various                                  services out there to to start to build                                  these prototypes to figure out how how                                  it actually feels to work with now a lot                                  of the services that are out there they                                  don't they're not really super rich                                  interactions they're good for you know                                  testing basic click throughs if you have                                  you know really rich jquery interactions                                  and you probably want to use something                                  more like dreamweaver a text mate and                                  more of a professional developer to take                                  it to the level but i just wanted to                                  outline you know what they are and why                                  they're important and just like the i do                                  video if i was to leave if i was to take                                  that views design that I'd the                                  storyboard that i just showed you and                                  send it over to a developer and say                                  develop this it wouldn't be happy when I                                  got it back because sometimes just you                                  learn things through interacting with it                                  just like with that shopping cart they                                  learned like you know I don't I don't                                  know what they learned but I know they                                  learn stuff to interacting with it so I                                  really kind of encouraged this notion of                                  building prototypes and kind of learning                                  from other industries as I you know                                  going back to that user experience is                                  only                                                                   other things that that have been built                                  for four years that that cost a lot of                                  money and if we were to learn from those                                  industries you'd learn that all of them                                  do prototypes like for example if you                                  were to build a you know some type of                                  skyscraper you can bet that there's a                                  prototype showing how the Sun hits it                                  and what it's like at different times a                                  day additionally car is also really                                  expensive there's always prototypes                                  for cars so I think there's lots to                                  learn from other industries and trying                                  to build prototypes before we take them                                  to market safe can save a lot of money                                  oh I got it back so now we know who                                  we're designing for why they have                                  problems now and all and we've come up                                  with a bunch of ideas to to solve for                                  those problems we basically need to                                  validate and so I put this quote up here                                  because I think it's a really good one                                  which is you know an expert is the man                                  who knows ii stuff he knows the answer                                  as an academy self I I i follow this to                                  heart I really i mean i have some good                                  ideas from doing this for a long time                                  and i have i have some assumptions in                                  terms of how things will work but I                                  never really believed that I know the                                  answer I believe that my customers know                                  the answer and so I think you always                                  should validate whatever you're building                                  doesn't seem to be working                                  I got it back but it doesn't work                                  so how do we do that we can do it                                  through moderated tests which is what                                  most people know by usability testing                                  and a moderated test is just that you                                  have somebody that's sitting in a room                                  that's trying to guide a customer                                  through a specific task these can happen                                  in a lab setting they can happen in a                                  remote setting I've actually learned                                  through doing both for many years that I                                  think a lab setting is kind of a waste                                  of time and that you can get largely the                                  same results from from a remote test now                                  given the tools that are available to us                                  and you don't have the problems that                                  come into play with the lab like if                                  you've got a lab and you get multiple                                  resources well you get a schedule around                                  that lab and so the lab becomes a                                  bottleneck additionally a lab is just it                                  costs an awful lot of money Taylor I                                  lost it again                                  self moderated tests we kind of mix and                                  match the two of these things so                                  moderated test we do if we are really                                  really interested in getting the right                                  customers involved you know we don't                                  because recruiting can take a lot of                                  time and and for example one you know I                                  cover this later but you know one of the                                  primary things that we used to find                                  users as Twitter using my account or the                                  Drupal gardens account and so the people                                  that are going to come in through those                                  accounts are going to be people that are                                  somewhat familiar with either Drupal or                                  Drupal Gardens versus if I want to learn                                  more about designers that have don't                                  have any knowledge of those things then                                  we would use a professional recruiter                                  and then along the sides there are these                                  different services that are out there                                  that allow you to do usability tests                                  that are unmoderated and there are some                                  problems that come into play with that                                  but there's still a great way to                                  supplement what you're doing to to make                                  sure that your designs work so user                                  testing calm as the service that we use                                  and we use it because they have their                                  own pool of people that are already                                  ready to go so all you have to do is                                  create a survey so that you're                                  soliciting the right kind of people and                                  then you can then use your testing comp                                  does the rest to try to bring those                                  people in and you basically set up a                                  series of tasks that you want those                                  users to do and they go forward and and                                  do those tasks and the outcome is a                                  bunch of recorded videos that you then                                  have to do analysis on but you know it                                  doesn't really take any of your time                                  except for setting up the test and                                  pointing them to the right location and                                  then all the testing and everything                                  happens and the sidelines which allows                                  you to do two or three or four tests at                                  once you can have one big moderated test                                  going on at the same time you've got                                  four or five or ten                                                                                                            there's these static image self                                  moderated tests this verify app up there                                  is my new favorite of all of the                                  usability tools that have come around                                  what a static image self moderate test                                  is is you're basically taking a image of                                  a page like the Drupal Gardens wireframe                                  I showed you earlier putting it up to                                  one of these services and you're asking                                  them to do things with it you know maybe                                  they're maybe it's a five second test                                  where they have to tell you what stands                                  out to them and say if you present a UI                                  to them and then take it down yet they                                  have to tell you what stands out or                                  there's different things you can do with                                  label tests lots of lots of stuff you                                  can do there but it's basically all                                  around you know a static image getting                                  feedback off that static image                                  navigation tests so there's there's this                                  tool that's been around for an awful                                  long time web sort which was if you're                                  trying to figure out the navigation of                                  your website if the idea is to take a                                  bunch of index cards and organize them                                  all and such or ask people to organize                                  them all in such a way that you can                                  analyze and figure out what are the big                                  patterns it requires a lot of users to                                  do the test but it's it's good if you if                                  you're not really sure what your ia                                  should be you can use a service like web                                  sort to try to help you figure that out                                  there's two different types of tests                                  there's open sorting tests and clothes                                  sorting tests and the differences a                                  closed sorting test is you have                                  navigation in mind and you're trying to                                  figure out how a bunch of people place                                  you know various pages into that                                  navigation and an open test is you've                                  got                                  you know people are just organizing it                                  how they see fit a clothes or test you                                  need less people than an open sore test                                  the other tools there I think are pretty                                  interesting to a tree jack and plane                                  frame plane frame is actually a child of                                  web sort and what that does is it allows                                  you to test your navigation devoid of                                  the interface itself so in other words                                  it's like all you're doing is                                  interacting with a tree structure and                                  you ask people like using aqua calm for                                  example we might say you know how would                                  you learn about Drupal garden soooo aqua                                  calm and they're not going to the Aqua                                  com site they're actually just using                                  this tree structure and when they get it                                  right they say that they think they've                                  found it and that way you can tell is it                                  your navigation that's working or not                                  working or is it the site design that's                                  working or not working DIY testing let's                                  do it yourself testing you know so I                                  hardly believe that that anybody can do                                  their own usability testing there's just                                  certain things you've got to watch out                                  for like you got to make sure you're                                  targeting your the right audience you                                  certainly don't want to do a usability                                  test with the wrong with the wrong                                  people or else you're just wasting a                                  bunch of money you have to learn to be                                  unbiased and that is you can't ask                                  questions that have the answers in them                                  like if you were to do if you were to                                  ask people and ask drupal users to find                                  content well the answer is given away in                                  your question so instead you have to ask                                  questions like suppose you created an                                  unpublished article a month ago how you                                  know can you tell me how you'd locate                                  that article and republish it right                                  that's how you can be unbiased in that                                  case you'll have to do more listening                                  than talking that's a really hard thing                                  to do but ninety-five percent of                                  the job is just as just listening and                                  when they ask you questions which they                                  will ask you questions it's pushing                                  those questions back on people usually I                                  tell people you know I'm going to do                                  this I'm going to push them back on you                                  and only we only when you feel that you                                  would quit or bend in our call support                                  don't tell me when you would reach that                                  point and then I'll give you the answer                                  and then I'll just know from that it's a                                  task failure so I'm not leaving him                                  hanging and then the last is you've got                                  a document patterns it doesn't do you                                  any good to like fix every anomaly that                                  shows up you're looking at all your                                  tests the results and looking for the                                  patterns that that show up and you're                                  trying to address those patterns you fix                                  those patterns and then you reiterate                                  and test again so another test for you                                  which of these tests which were these                                  you is do you think tests better a or b                                  a show hands                                  be show hands                                  hey interesting so                                  so this is from jareds pool a while ago                                  so I mean you can read it for yourself                                  but you're wrong be tested better and be                                  tested better because what happens is                                  people people try to sniff out                                  information they're looking for a                                  specific keyword and sometimes you can                                  shorten that information so much so that                                  the information no longer makes any                                  sense but what the point that I'm trying                                  to make here is a lot of times when                                  you're looking at a UI and you're making                                  your own judgments a lot of times you                                  make incorrect inferences in terms of                                  what the problem is and so when you look                                  at what happened after this is really                                  kind of funny so you know this is what                                  the guy that the customer of the                                  specific test said so seems that                                  business executives prefer to look at                                  fairly plain textual content online                                  rather than cheerful graphic interfaces                                  plus they prefer vertical to horizontal                                  groupings of options longer were to your                                  texture click links after I thought                                  about it a while it made total sense                                  users are trained to allow their eyes to                                  scan down something that looks like                                  search results which was what it looks                                  like graphics and images are not what                                  the eyes trained for online you know                                  it's like so this guy is like he's made                                  these inferences and if he didn't have                                  somebody like Jared spool on there to                                  help him through it you know you'd run                                  into trouble am I out of time okay all                                  right so that's all I had I guess so                                  thanks                                  you
