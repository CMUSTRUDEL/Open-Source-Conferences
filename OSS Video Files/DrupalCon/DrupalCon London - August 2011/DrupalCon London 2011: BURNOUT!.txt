Title: DrupalCon London 2011: BURNOUT!
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Problem: 
We have an incredible group of people who invest deeply in our common project. Some significant portion of this group is near burnout at any given time, and we've lost important contributors, some famously, as a result of this.

The more general problem is: How can we help our contributors to manage their work so they don't get so close to burnout? How can we help people find (or regain) balance while dealing with the technical and social problems of contributing to our great project?

Proposed solution: 
* Begin a concentrated initiative to grow and keep our contributors, and to keep them happy.
* Make this a goal a key project responsibility.
* Learn from other organizations and resources ways to approach this.

	                              it is on well thank you everybody for                               coming I wouldn't have my feelings hurt                               at all if you would just come as far to                               the front as you can because what we're                               supposed to be having here is a                               conversation and I think we all have                               things to contribute to this                               conversation so I'd love it if you came                               up here I think everybody here knows                                something about the topic of burnout and                                it's been a conversation that we've been                                I guess I should introduce myself I                                forgot to write I'm Randy fam RFA on                                drupal.org and I'm like many of you kind                                of a droop aholic and Drupal holics can                                have some trouble with the with burnout                                so with that how long has it been since                                you beautiful here i am at drupa holic                                synonymous yeah that's right so just to                                get to set the stage for what we want to                                accomplish today we want to just go                                quickly into understanding what burnout                                is kind of as a as a diagnostic not as a                                it is a formal area of study there's                                formal research about what it means it's                                a serious issue in our current world                                just in general you know it it has                                specific characteristics and there are                                specific things that can be done about                                it and there are ways of looking at it                                both from the individual point of view                                and from the organizational point of                                view so one of the most important                                researchers basically says that burnout                                is all the fault of the organization I                                think we all know that that's not                                entirely true but the fact that she is                                written a whole book to that effect                                tells us perhaps that we can adjust our                                organizations to affect how we how we                                take care of our individuals so                                so we're going to talk about burnout                                from the individual and the community                                perspective and the big point the reason                                that we're having a conversation is to                                talk about what we as a community can do                                to prevent to cure to deal with this                                whole thing okay so that's the that's                                the point of this yep go for it thank                                you I appreciate it so burn out if                                you're kind enough to be here you might                                have read the set of vlog entries that I                                wrote about about this that go into more                                detail than then we'll go into today but                                kind of a formal description would be a                                state of emotional mental physical                                exhaustion and you're probably familiar                                with they can't do anything syndrome                                from having work too hard on something                                for too long that at some points can be                                quite difficult to recover from you know                                if you run a marathon you may be sick of                                the marathon but probably in a week or                                so you'll probably be okay but it seems                                that some kinds of burnout can just                                stalk us and stay with us in a way that                                we wish they wouldn't and it can be                                difficult to to get our lives back                                together so the key researcher on this                                points to three dimensions of burnout                                exhaustion emotional physical cynicism I                                think we've seen that in burned-out                                members of our community sometimes where                                you say oh that'll never know that'll                                never be fixed in Drupal ah you know no                                way you're going to get any you're not                                knowing you know what you're going to                                get so and so to do that like move the                                core directory what quick skids has                                burned out on when it when was that                                issue opened                                                           been                                                               first it's going in so yeah                                and ineffectiveness is a is a third a                                third dimension you know you start to                                feel like you can't do anything when in                                reality you know you used to do stuff                                but as you begin to feel an effective                                you you don't seem to be able to do it                                anymore go ahead and hit that next one                                if you would things so I actually don't                                want to minimize what we as individuals                                should be doing to to deal with burnout                                even though that's not what this                                conversation is about I think it's                                really important for us to recognize                                that we have responsibilities and                                individuals for marshaling our own                                resources and that's not just for the                                 community that's for us so obviously                                 these are very these are things that                                 your wife or your husband has been                                 telling you over and over again you know                                 I mean these are very obvious things but                                 it doesn't mean that they're not true so                                 budget your physical resources eat good                                 food get some exercise get some sleep                                 well and and and these may need to be                                 true over the long term like I said                                 sometimes with the marathon you can                                 recover in a week or a day or whatever                                 your recovery period is but sometimes                                 when you've done some damage to yourself                                 by working too hard working too                                 intensely or becoming too emotionally                                 involved with some thing for some reason                                 it takes a lot more time of dealing with                                 these things honestly to to get that                                 straightened out obviously prioritizing                                 there is a limit to what we can do we                                 are not infinite and we are going to                                 have to make choices about what we do                                 work on and and that you know it's just                                 obvious one of the key things that was                                 pointed out in everything I read about                                 burnout was that your social connections                                 are fundamental to maintaining your                                 equal                                 equilibrium so we're all doing great                                 socially right here now we're having a                                 great time with all of our Drupal                                 friends but a lot of us are can be                                 fairly isolated you know you go on IRC                                 that is not the same as having a close                                 friend it's not the same and I tend to                                 get most of my social involvement                                 actually most of my social involvement                                 is either through my wife's friends                                 because she's a good friend maker we                                 live in a little town and she's done a                                 great job in the last couple of years of                                 getting involved with some people there                                 and I have not so a lot of my own                                 personal social involvement is in fact                                 IRC and drupalcon and it's just not                                 gonna it just doesn't cut it so anyway                                 very strongly pointed out in there that                                 you need to have real social activities                                 going real friendships going on and I                                 thought that this quote here was                                 absolutely fundamental and that we                                 should all just memorize it the                                 Scientific American article on burnout                                 said as early as possible in your career                                 you must absorb internalize adopt the                                 idea that your physical and mental                                 health are at least as important as                                 anything you can do seeking success at                                 work and of course in this context work                                 means Drupal community your modules that                                 you maintain and blah blah blah whether                                 that's work or not but that idea of                                 recognizing that you are more valuable                                 than the work that you can do is so                                 fundamental if if you don't if you don't                                 keep yourself alive then you won't be                                 producing anything next year or two                                 years if you don't keep yourself it from                                 your own perspective if you don't take                                 care of yourself this year                                 you won't be contributing to Drupal next                                 year it's it's an easy equation right                                 but how many of us really get it we you                                 know we you probably have screwed up                                 before because you're here right I mean                                 it's just you know it's just that you                                 definitely wouldn't be listening to me                                 why is he talking about there was a                                 tweet today why is he talking about is                                 something wrong you know why is he                                 talking about burnout okay thank you go                                 ahead and so as I went through this this                                 great book by the by the most important                                 researcher in this field she said a                                 number of really really important things                                 and and went into those and some more                                 depth but some of the things that were                                 listed we feel overloaded that's a                                 pretty easy thing as a contributor in                                 the Drupal world to get yourself in that                                 position a lot of us are basically                                 suckers for love you know I'm you know                                 if somebody if I could do something and                                 somebody says something nice to me I'm                                 going to do more of it right and and and                                 if I see something that I can do and                                 that somebody will love me if I do I'm                                 just a sucker for it and I think in                                 communities like this there may be a lot                                 of us out there well that very very                                 quickly leads to overload and there are                                 many ways that the Drupal community is                                 maybe worse than that worse than some                                 other situations because I can see that                                 this needs to be done therefore I could                                 do it and this needs to be done                                 therefore I could do it and we have to                                 figure out a way to deal with that as a                                 community one of the classic examples is                                 we have that there's many many examples                                 like this but we have some we have some                                 module                                 creators in our midst and I think that I                                 think quick sketch would probably be                                 among them and Dave Reed and eaten and a                                 number of other people who are just                                 generating modules you know just I mean                                 just Dave Reed we joke about every day                                 right I mean it's like every day there's                                 a new module well in the Drupal                                 community when you create a module                                 you're actually expected to maintain it                                 so if you generate things like that you                                 are going to be overloaded very very                                 very quickly and how to deal with that                                 is one of the things that we have to                                 talk about a second area of burnout how                                 organizations can burn out individuals                                 is the lack of control over what we do                                 and in this book that talked a lot about                                 that from a like a corporate standpoint                                 where you don't have enough control over                                 your own work but in the in the Drupal                                 world there's so many dimensions of it                                 you just can hardly stop you know it's                                 like if you work on core work you might                                 be working on an issue that you were                                 became interested in in                                                  been able to figure out a way to get it                                 in yet you might you know you might have                                 worked on if you've worked on core stuff                                 then you have issues that you wrote up                                 and you solved a year or two ago that                                 haven't yet landed and maybe the and you                                 have a few that never will it it it's                                 extremely painful not being rewarded for                                 our work we're actually pretty proud in                                 the Drupal community that we do reward                                 people for their work but all you have                                 to do is talk to a few people and you'll                                 find that not everybody feels that way                                 all the time especially in some of the                                 less visible areas I think we could find                                 a lot of people who work on the                                 documentation project who don't feel                                 rewarded for what they do they don't                                 feel acknowledged they don't feel like                                 what they do is important there's a                                 whole bunch of different places in the                                 community and even though we've worked                                 on that                                 and we value that as support is another                                 great example and there's a long-running                                 tragic issue about that right now we're                                 even in the issue people are feeling                                 unappreciated and so even though I on                                 this one even though we claim that we                                 know how to reward ourselves for our                                 work I don't think we do and I think                                 it's easy to find out if you just talk                                 to a few newbies or a few people around                                 that you find that that's not that we're                                 not as good as we wish we were the                                 breakdown in community bullet I find                                 really interesting I I remember as we                                 were getting close to having Drupal                                   come out did you remember seeing some                                 core contributors saying horrible things                                 on Twitter like this will never work and                                 it's all going down in flames and                                 essentially that's it's probably both                                 cause and result of a breakdown in                                 community you know where people aren't                                 people are depressed themselves the                                 community is not working the way it                                 ought to of people start to snap at each                                 other just what you would see in a poor                                 morale in a shop with poor morale or a                                 family with poor morale so this whole                                 breakdown and community thing is another                                 thing that we have seen happen and we've                                 seen it happen periodically I thought                                 the fairness bullet that we aren't                                 treated fairly was really interesting                                 there are lot if you're going to work in                                 the Drupal community you actually have                                 to already accept that you're not going                                 to be treated fairly that you're not                                 going to be necessarily acknowledged at                                 the level that you expect or or the                                 things won't go the way you expect how                                 many of you as a young contributor and                                 early contributor to Drupal were                                 treated poorly in IRC or yelled at or                                 you know that was your first experience                                 Angie right get jumped in IRC or or you                                 posted a patch you'd like to figure it                                 out the whole patch thing right you                                 posted a patch and and then you just get                                 ripped up some one side and down the                                 other or from another perspective you                                 you try to solve a problem and there's                                 no way to figure out how to solve it you                                 know it if if you take the time to solve                                 a problem in a community as open and as                                 you know as soft as Drupal is Drupal is                                 soft you can find your way to do things                                 in the Drupal community there are ways                                 to get things done but a lot of times                                 especially when you're new you don't                                 know how in the world you would do that                                 so who do I talk to well there's only                                 one answer right if you want to get                                 something done you just talk to web                                 chick but that doesn't scale very well                                 in fact I think there's a hole eaten has                                 a whole domain right web chick doesn't                                 scale or something like that so that's                                 another area of the whole fairness thing                                 that I found really interesting is that                                 because it's not clear who the leaders                                 are or what the roles are and because                                 the organization is a self-organized                                 rather than having a hierarchical or an                                 obvious hierarchical structure we have                                 some serious issues with that and I                                 think one of the ways that we have to                                 deal with that is we have to we have to                                 make it more obvious who people are what                                 roles they play make it more explicit                                 you know we have a lot of areas of that                                 we think about in terms of drupal.org                                 and users but it's actually an                                 organizational characteristic that we                                 have to find our way through and then of                                 course the conflicting values thing with                                 all geeks with you know with phones or                                 on the internet all the time and where                                 we can work as much at home as we work                                 at work if they're not the same place                                 and how do we sort out what we're doing                                 that is work from what's community work                                 and are they the same thing there are so                                 few boundaries in our lives in general                                 it's not just the tech issue that lots                                 of people deal with it's the fact that                                 we are in a community that has something                                 to do with work that has something to do                                 with hobby lots of us work at home we                                 just have all these conflicting values                                 in addition to of course classic                                 conflicting values like can I get this                                 done and what quality and in one time                                 which are just standard software type                                 conflicting values so I think the Drupal                                 community is actually got a number of                                 very explicit and I mean add the this                                 book just nailed many things about the                                 Drupal community so let's go on to that                                 next one how are we doing we've got ten                                 minutes left yeah yeah yeah so you have                                 you're the only one in the Drupal                                 community that has boundaries which                                 basically means you're way too lazy                                 yeah yeah she doesn't do enough i can                                 tell you she doesn't do enough yeah yeah                                 thatthat's I commend you for doing that                                 and I try that I have a long ways to go                                 because creating those boundaries in                                 keeping some boundaries is a                                 fundamentally important thing you're a                                 smart person you give lessons yeah yeah                                 yeah that's good ok so now I want to I                                 want to do some brainstorming I did a                                 blog post with a lot more bullets than                                 this but I'd like to do some                                 brainstorming and have you come up with                                 you know with some ideas and we'll                                 describe those and and get get some of                                 those in there but it's fundamental to                                 us that we have to keep our contributors                                 and keep them healthy that's us right I                                 mean we're the future of Drupal or we're                                 going to get replaced by all the newbies                                 one of the two right but wouldn't it be                                 better to have us and the newbies I                                 think so we're pretty good we got Drupal                                 where it is right we're we've what we've                                 all been a part of this it'd be better                                 if we were part of its future as well if                                 we burn up ourselves we aren't so my                                 opinion is that we have to rethink and                                 drop unsustainable processes we just                                 have to recognize them and we have to                                 say this has to be fixed and I can name                                 a number of those the the handbook is                                 one that's unsustainable I don't know                                 any way that we can get the handbook                                 ever under control given the what it is                                 today and its history so we have to                                 figure out what we can do about that                                 that that's an example I I listed some                                 others the UX team leads that's another                                 one you know it just it goes it goes on                                 and on the number of things that we have                                 that we just oh well we're going to have                                 it                                                                       about the full project application                                 process okay which we tried to do                                 according to our values a year ago but                                 well and two years ago and three years                                 ago and we have not succeeded in                                 actually doing what our values say we                                 want to do so we have to do something                                 different we have to come up with                                 something that we actually do instead of                                 just intending to do so I think                                 increasing resources is a great thing it                                 doesn't always work there isn't an                                 infinite amount of money in the world                                 but you know with the drupal.org                                 redesign it got done with some increased                                 resources and and the give migration I                                 don't think good of society succeeded                                 without increased resources that was so                                 that was brilliant another idea is                                 recycling our responsibilities so I                                 think that the day breeds of the world                                 should be able to drop their modules off                                 in the recycle bin and people who are                                 interested in those modules should be                                 able to pick them up we have a process                                 like that but it's much scarier we call                                 it abandoned modules and and it's not                                 nice right it's like oh well this was a                                 module and somebody went away and left                                 it and now it's abandoned you know we                                 need to explicitly recycle                                 responsibilities we need to make that                                 normal and good so that people can move                                 on I like that so she said you could                                 make it where you sign up for a new term                                 so you can make it you can make a                                 commitment to a module but it has a                                 limit it's not perpetual I like it I                                 like it yeah                                 yeah yeah I think adopt instead of                                 abandoned would be a good idea yeah well                                 I I totally agree so so Eaton's point is                                 he got in trouble for giving away a                                 module to somebody that maybe was                                 unknown but you know if I don't take                                 care of my module how am I better from                                 somebody that's unknown you know we just                                 have to deal with that I you know if if                                 somebody comes along and they're willing                                 to take care of a module and I am not in                                 reality taking care of it I should give                                 it to them yeah but yeah i agree i think                                 we have to work on that and we all know                                 if you maintain modules are maintained                                 projects we all know that there are                                 issues that people come in their                                 interest for a little while and they go                                 away and it's not that easy to keep a                                 smart person invested in a project or                                 documentation or whatever it is that                                 they're working on but i think i think                                 just coming up with a way to i heard a                                 couple of great ideas just now about                                 tourmalet more not term limits but but                                 signing up for a time-limited commitment                                 on on on a thing that you do and                                 explicitly recognizing when you when you                                 can't maintain something and looking for                                 others                                 so roarsome rules I think we're talking                                 about everywhere and I think that's                                 important yeah yes so so the idea is                                 that you need to set expectations and                                 and maybe move a little more gently                                 between maintain errs you know like with                                 weave we should probably let new                                 maintainer Xin more easily and we should                                 probably take over maintainer ship and                                 modules more easily Co maintain ership                                 we should probably let that flow even                                 though there's some risk involved but                                 the risk of us over-committing is                                 extremely high and that's what we need                                 to realize is that it's not just a risk                                 that you get some newbie that will screw                                 up the work that you did there's also                                 the risk that you'll screw yourself up                                 so that you can't contribute in new                                 areas and you know there's real                                 opportunity and burn out if you can take                                 somebody who has has found a way to                                 recycle themselves and restart in a new                                 project they can do new things with some                                 energy that they couldn't do if they                                 didn't get out of there so um civility                                 is a long term theme of the Drupal                                 community when we are not civil we                                 damage the people around us and that's                                 kind of like that breakdown and                                 community thing but I think that                                 civility is something that we have to                                 pay attention to we've had some twitter                                 twitter escapades lately where people                                 going pylon and Twitter                                 probably how they will probably wouldn't                                 in real life and we probably have to                                 stop piling on and Twitter yeah or stop                                 using Twitter yeah twitter is pretty                                 well established you might not notice                                 that but if you've already proven that                                 she says she's made like                                                                                                                       proven that she's smarter than we are                                 because she turns off for IRC at five so                                 so what else can we do what else can we                                 do Claire practical one my first core                                 patch ever just not a big patch is a                                 small little feature edition back into                                 the triple for seven days I think but at                                 that point we're still small enough                                 trees always remembered when he                                 committed a patch to say thank you and                                 the issue queue after he said it                                 committed thanks still doesn't like                                 ninety-eight percent of time and that is                                 very much to his credit if you maintain                                 a module please please please say thank                                 you every time you commit patch yeah                                 that's right there's some some                                 maintenance that are very explicit                                 thanks for reporting that you know I                                 like that I mean yeah it's and saying                                 thank you when you commit is a great a                                 great influence on civility and thanks                                 for the it just needs a little work and                                 then go and try to be constructive in                                 reviewing it as opposed to saying this                                 is garbage you really should have read                                 the specs first you know especially a                                 fabulous set especially for dealing with                                 a newer contributor who sent you spray                                 do that word thank you with the more                                 high-profile you are in the community                                 the more important is that that's that's                                 a good point that's a good point Jeff                                 we have to actually say ok when they                                 said I agree with that so yeah one of                                 the things that the Drupal code of                                 conduct says very explicitly is that we                                 will step down gracefully it needs to                                 say a little more that was all copied                                 from a boon to of course but I think it                                 needs to say a little bit more it needs                                 to say we will step down gracefully and                                 this is what it might mean and here's                                 where the recycle bin is and you're                                 welcome when you come back you know so I                                 definitely think that it did drupal.org                                 / DC OC Drupal code of conduct so yeah                                 yeah we are if you we're done we're done                                 with everything so where we have to move                                 on to the we have to move on to the                                 project review committing to a                                 particular term for responsibility just                                 want to contribute and you know Bobby                                 with contribution then they just want to                                 leave it asking someone to say that i                                 spend like six min today yeah i don't                                 think we're saying that so so his point                                 is that we don't we probably can't make                                 everybody commits for a time limit to                                 every responsibility I don't think                                 anybody was suggesting that I think they                                 were saying that                                 instead of a perpetual responsibility                                 module maintenance for example should be                                 a time-limited responsibility doesn't                                 mean that you can't make a single                                 contribution in the queue oh that's the                                 abandoned module process but that's a                                 different thing meters inactive you can                                 try to take over modulated yeah yeah                                 anyway what I think this is an important                                 conversation I'd like us to continue                                 this conversation throughout the Drupal                                 community and see if we can adjust our                                 processes to with respect to what they                                 do to our people I think we have to                                 think about that in all these different                                 angles and I appreciate you coming and                                 conversing about it so
