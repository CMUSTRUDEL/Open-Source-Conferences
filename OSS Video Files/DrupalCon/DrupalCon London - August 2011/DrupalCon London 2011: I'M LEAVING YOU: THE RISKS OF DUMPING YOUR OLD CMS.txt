Title: DrupalCon London 2011: I'M LEAVING YOU: THE RISKS OF DUMPING YOUR OLD CMS
Publication date: 2013-03-23
Playlist: DrupalCon London - August 2011
Description: 
	Presented by
Nicole Lind
In the old days, moving to Drupal often meant converting static pages or templates to Drupal nodes. Today, it is rare that we get to build a site from scratch. Reality is that most major Drupal projects are now migrations from other content management systems.

Taking on such a migration is not a trivial decision for an organization. There is a great deal of complexity in the reasons for migrating, but the decision is often not understood well amongst the various stakeholders.

This session is not a workshop about why to choose Drupal. Rather, I will discuss what to expect after the decision is made and techniques for managing the change given the various reasons you may have for doing so.

Intended audience
This session is geared toward project managers and managers dealing with significant risk associated with migration from a legacy CMS platform to Drupal.

Questions answered by this session
How to set realistic expectations with stakeholders?

How to document an appropriate risk analysis and mitigation strategy in regards to a migration to Drupal?

You got "attitude" from legacy CMS users? Strategies on how to best deal with them.

dumping your old                               woman for drupal and they often times I                               feel like a custom that talked about                               moving to group alittle liners can move                                to drupal and I have kind of the idea of                                actually because education the ones who

         of the things I'm going to talk about                                thing is of course the hidden dangers of                                moving and we have people the fabulous

                       code and again smaller knowledge and                                then often and bones are getting some                                understanding and what required and get                                into the details over colleges like to                                get my head straight as I'm cause and                                formulate from the key issues but I'm                                going in power as a cohort of this                                subject and it contained and again we                                can't going to have to leave some of the                                white carcass important what I call                                Google CC and essentially group will                                double speak and I'm going to have to                                get low online for everyone here and                                it's basically it's kind of refilling                                them folks I went there that don't go                                down fighting over here's why penalizing                                sounds a little softer and gentler than                                Rolla so there's a lot of Drupal switch                                that goes into the propulsion project is                                to get familiar with gareth edwards and                                of course going first which is I think                                we've all heard the model for that being                                able to easily with them cater to you                                and you start going to the particle                                 I'll the fighting levels already                                built I think we've heard that quite a                                bit the truth is is that there's general                                a lot of customization their development                                work with no income on putting the                                design and functionality the decline or                                your organization is involved working                                for                                 that's the first of all people finally                                 Donald loved one my favorite of course                                 the design they're almost balance and                                 discipline work week essentially you                                 know we'll have what knee but it retains                                 any functionality once again be wary of                                 this was often just even some of the                                 smallest changes into diamond contains                                 some significant

lot this one table a couple lot                                 and the US Department of Energy is there                                 was a constant statement after they have                                 kind of fold the idea of what Drupal and                                 that we want more flexible content                                 management system what does that really                                 mean and what we came to find out is                                 that they wanted a CMS that essentially                                 active abhi we'd like a knowledge about                                 proof grasshopper with no but the truth                                 internet was in that case we result in a                                 completely custom implementations you                                 know and most people think that it's                                 time to roll out and often they're my                                 buddies while you're doing the                                 deployment so be mindful of equity                                 hospitals often on your wrist is that a                                 farce

                                apparently want to do people development                                 analyst so no it is not only we can do                                 mobile again that not only on the                                 confronting final corner you're                                 composing different management styles                                 specific service

       I call next probably spectators of                                 desire I know you get food thanks                                 oftentimes don't have a fun you know its                                 large impact on if I was utter but it's                                 often feel will maybe and faithful those                                 who yells louder and this may be                                 embarrassed of essentially to keep those                                 sort of things so again the doublespeak                                 and one of the things about

                 will do it but it's very very important                                 that there is strong management bill                                 could cloud that dialogue and that there                                 is a catalyst mechanism that they can                                 restaurant so open communication with                                 your queen is critical and making sure                                 that they are getting different but once                                 again well i probably will cost the                                 client really                                 can the difference between a bulb and                                 takis conclusion they have no idea and                                 so it's a little bit of it is poison to                                 teach people the difference between and                                 don't you what you're doing I can work                                 for them I
