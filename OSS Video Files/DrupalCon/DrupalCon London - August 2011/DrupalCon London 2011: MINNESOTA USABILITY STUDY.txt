Three years after our first round of formal usability testing on Drupal 6, the UX team returned to the University of Minnesota in May 2011 to uncover usability issues and patterns for Drupal 7. After making broad changes in D7, it was critical for us to validate if we are inching forward in our goal. With this aim in mind, we tested eight participants and asked them to perform some tasks. All the participants were site builders with no experience with Drupal.

The intent of the session is to share findings from the study, and discuss how the community can take this initiative forward to make a more usable Drupal 8.

Intended audience
Attend this panel presentation if you are interested in usability, understanding the user experience and the usability road map for Drupal 8.

Questions answered by this session
How was the study conducted?

What was tested?

What works well and what needs improvement in D7?

How was the overall experience for our users of using D7?

What does this mean for Drupal 8?

	                              welcome we're here to talk today about a                               set of usability of tests that we did                               back in the University of Minnesota back                               in May this was the first sort of formal                               use abilities testing we have done with                               Drupal                                                            formal usability testing a couple of                               them actually with Drupal                                                                                                              also test drupal                                                   bunch of work in Drupal                                             address some of the issues we found back                                there so we'll talk a little bit about                                that here so with me is I'm I'm Angie                                Byron or web chick on drupal.org i'm                                here with brad Bowman or beer ad be Jen                                Lampton or Jen Lampton and Boyan summers                                or Boyan all right so this was the team                                who came down for doing the usability                                testing we had representation from the                                University of Minnesota we also had                                boyens summers who is one of drupal the                                drupal projects UX leads dar mesh is                                another usability specialist works at                                aquia Jen Lambton it does a whole bunch                                of training with chapter                                               very cognizant of the kind of things                                that new users bash their face against I                                also came in my capacity as a Drupal                                  core maintainer I was very interesting                                to hear like what what you know what all                                overworked did brad is also a member of                                the usability team David Rothstein is a                                core developer who did want to work on                                the d                                                                  a creative lead so designer we all sort                                of got together to try and bring our                                observations to the table so what do we                                been up to what were we up to in that                                week this is us goofing around around a                                table um the lab facility is kind of                                interesting it'sit's like you sit in a                                room like a small room and then there's                                one way glass and you can see what                                participants are doing and you have like                                a feed of what their eyeballs are                                looking at and also like you know what                                what they're saying on the microphone                                and it was interesting to like hear them                                get progressively more and more                                frustrated but we'll talk about that                                later so um so why usability why do we                                care about usability we basically care                                about usability because that's you know                                that's sort of what                                makes Drupal fun to interact with that's                                what you know brings new people to the                                project and that sort of thing and so                                the way that the testing was done is                                that the person was in the room alone                                and they were asked to think out loud as                                they were doing things so in other words                                like you know they'd say okay I'm                                supposed to change the color of this                                thing so i think i'm going to go under                                appearance and oh there it is right                                there you know or i'm supposed to create                                a piece of content maybe you go under                                help you know or whatever that kind of                                thing and just talk through their                                process and where they're getting stuck                                and stuff like that why do we care about                                usability has anyone seen this graphic                                before okay so drupal kind of has this                                reputation of being a little bit hard to                                learn and so these are the learning                                curves for popular CMS's and you'd see                                you know WordPress kind of does that and                                joomla does this and you know mod X does                                this and then Drupal kind of goes up and                                it becomes this cliff that people hang                                themselves from and I'm bold those are                                shoveling bodies of yeah so we're trying                                to avoid like this perception we're                                trying to make Drupal so that you know                                people who aren't you know as embedded                                in the project as we all are can enjoy                                it as well so the goals of the testing                                were to validate the solutions to the                                Drupal                                                                we also wanted to start really early                                because Drupal                                                        you know a couple months prior and this                                would give us like a great starting                                point to know what issues we need to fix                                to do like I told miles inside so we we                                tested eight participants and suddenly                                it's interesting about these                                participants is everybody but one of                                 them had no previous experience with                                 Drupal but they had used other CMS's or                                 dreamweaver or that kind of thing so                                 these were web developers these weren't                                 like you know random people off the                                 street these were people at directly in                                 our target audience so these are people                                 who build websites and then we wanted                                 them to try Drupal and see what they                                 found and so for the most part we looked                                 at the site builder persona we weren't                                 testing like the DX of Drupal or some of                                 the developer features um but but yeah                                 so it was a pretty pretty awesome group                                 of people                                 yes we guess and to do a number of tests                                 tasks that and basically we gave them                                 this mock-up image and we said you know                                 go ahead and create the about Us page of                                 this you know site that you have here                                 you know change the background color                                 create a little block on the sidebar                                 that sort of thing when you when you                                 write up these tasks you can't actually                                 use any terminology that would clue them                                 in so you know you have to basically                                 point and say okay can you put this this                                 sponsor thing right here on the page and                                 then they would have to look at the                                 interface and sort of figure out from                                 there you know what how they wanted to                                 do that um and I'll hand it off to Brad                                 here to talk a little bit about some of                                 the past usability studies that we've                                 done and sort of the work we did in                                 Drupal                                                                   said in the past we've done usability                                 studies we did it at the University of                                 Minnesota back in two thousand eight and                                 also the University of Baltimore in two                                 thousand nine so some of the things that                                 some of the things that we were dealing                                 with in this test were things that were                                 problems that we found before so I'm                                 just going to you know quickly cover                                 some of the things that we found before                                 so you kind of have some perspective on                                 what we were coming into for this round                                 of testing one of the things that we                                 found in previous rounds of testing is                                 on the create content screen the default                                 content types in Drupal                                                 make sense to people a lot of people                                 were thinking of a with page they were                                 thinking of you know not just a content                                 on the page but everything that                                 surrounds that as well and then with                                 story I think a lot of people didn't                                 really know what to make of that they                                 either just didn't know usually or some                                 people would say it was like a like a                                 multi-page piece of content so they                                 expected it i mean almost like the book                                 module or something like that where you                                 could click through multiple pages of                                 something you were creating                                 if they did actually choose which                                 content type they wanted they were                                 presented with this screen which has a                                 couple issues the first is the the menu                                 settings is really prominent in most                                 cases when you create content you don't                                 actually want to put a little menu item                                 so people you know they click into that                                 and you know sort of be overwhelmed when                                 they were trying to create content the                                 other it's the the split summary at                                 cursor now right up there which has                                 pretty cool functionality but it's not                                 something that we really want to expose                                 to most users you does anybody know how                                 that works in Drupal                                                 like click the button in the form or the                                 field like cuts in half and the idea is                                 that the top is supposed to be the                                 teaser for the content and the bottom is                                 supposed to be the main content but                                 people would click that and they just                                 see the body field get cut in half and                                 they'd have like no idea what they were                                 supposed to do with that so I mean a lot                                 of people thought it was really cool and                                 would sit there and click back and forth                                 for a few minutes but very few people                                 actually understood what it was supposed                                 to be another issue is the collapsible                                 field sets there were kind of two                                 different things that you saw there the                                 first is that people saw that they were                                 links and they were editing content and                                 they didn't want to lose the context of                                 inputting things than their content so                                 they wouldn't click it the other is that                                 people got how it worked but thought it                                 was really important so they go through                                 and click every single collapsible field                                 set and look at what's inside of it and                                 you know there are things like authoring                                 information and you know revision                                 options and things like that but the                                 majority people just don't care about                                 going back to the menu so it's really                                 prominent on the Edit Page and then you                                 click into it to create a menu item and                                 this is what you get if you look at this                                 this form field that has like every like                                 all of Drupal's menu options in it                                 including everything under the                                 administrative section so you know user                                 would go to put something in a menu and                                 they'd have this drop-down with hundreds                                 of options including you know things in                                 the administration section so you know                                 who really wants to like create a node                                 and put it under the administrative                                 section like there may be a use case for                                 it somewhere but it's not something I                                 think that we want to expose to the                                 majority of people another one this is                                 this is the screen that you get after                                 you install Drupal it's basically a big                                 wall of text and in general people don't                                 really read giant walls of text so                                 that's one problem but even if they did                                 read this in this giant wall of text we                                 give them links to different sections of                                 the site like create content or the                                 administrators or the administrative                                 section and things like that and we                                 teach them that you know this is how you                                 get around triple this is how you do                                 tasking dribble and then as soon as you                                 create a piece of content and promoted                                 to the front page this screen gets taken                                 away for good so people install Drupal                                 you know they learn to get around using                                 this page and then as soon as as soon as                                 they put anything there it's wiped out                                 and they have to relearn how to do the                                 things that they've just learned how to                                 do                                 this is the screenshot of the                                 administrative section it's just it's                                 really overwhelming there are tons of                                 options here a lot of them the majority                                 of users you know don't want to know                                 about or don't care about things like                                 actions being above the fold or post                                 settings RSS publishing you know this is                                 something that the majority of people                                 you don't really care about and we're                                 just we're giving everyone this                                 information with the same prominent so                                 it just becomes overwhelming for a lot                                 of people also i mean if you compare                                 these two slides the actual i mean the                                 actual layout is pretty similar in both                                 cases it's just a giant wall of text so                                 we're really making people pay a lot                                 more attention than they should have to                                 anything another problem is what we call                                 the node orphanage after testing in                                 Drupal                                                                  node in Drupal                                                           a menu there's no way to get back to                                 that content well there's only one way                                 it's through the administrative section                                 here clicking that content link and                                 you'll get a list of content from there                                 but otherwise you know there's no you're                                 just on this random page there's no menu                                 item a lot of people would create                                 content and then immediately think that                                 that content was lost or have no idea                                 how to get back to it and I believe                                 Angie's going to talk about fixes for                                 Drupal                                               um yes so this is a bit about like what                                 we try to do to combat these problems in                                 Drupal                                                                   looks like this and this is basically                                 you know so some of the things that we                                 did for instance we took that                                 administrative page that was sort of all                                 over the place on the admin link and we                                 put it all at the top and sort of split                                 it out we also reorganize the                                 information architecture so it's more                                 task based so when people are you know                                 doing something with content we put all                                 that stuff under one area when they're                                 doing something with configuring their                                 site we put that all on our separate                                 area so you're not looking at the you                                 know content and then switching between                                 oh you know in this list of five things                                 content is the one that actually lets me                                 manage content but post settings in RSS                                 publishing or things i'm going to set                                 once if ever and never look at again and                                 then we have the contextual links this                                 is to allow us to you know if I'm                                 looking at a block in Drupal                                           to configure that block is to go back go                                 to admin site building blocks find the                                 block in the list click the configure                                 link twiddle something and then click                                 Save and then by the time I've done that                                 I have no idea what I was doing when I                                 happen to see that thing on the block                                 that needed fixing so contextual links                                 was an attempt to fix that so now you                                 look at the thing you click here click                                 configure block and you get right in                                 there we also added this shortcut block                                 a shortcut bar in an attempt to appease                                 sort of like power users who you know                                 you know memorize URLs and just type                                 them in or that kind of thing and                                 basically you know because there are                                 sometimes more clicks to get two pages                                 that you got to before by you know just                                 going to the admin page and going right                                 there this was a you know an ability to                                 sort of like take the most frequently                                 access pages and stick them in an easy                                 bookmark thing and that's configurable                                 user role we also made a number of                                 changes to the create content page so                                 the first thing over there is we renamed                                 page and story to article and basic page                                 because nobody knew what a story was and                                 again that page they thought was the                                 entire page from the top left or the                                 bottom right of the browser window we                                 also added the                                                     notice that these two things look                                 different from each other                                 of both the overlay and the seven theme                                 and that's an attempt to create stark                                 visual contrast between you're looking                                 at your site or you're doing something                                 to maintain your site we also made the                                 story content type very different or                                 side the article content site very                                 different from page because in Drupal                                   page and story are both just title and                                 body and that's it there is no                                 difference to them whatsoever visually                                 at least while you're creating it when                                 you get done creating it there's a                                 subtle difference which is one shows up                                 on the front page and shows off their                                 information the other one doesn't so we                                 decided let's make it very different so                                 we added a tags vocabulary you can see                                 we also added image uploading there so                                 it's very clear like this is for article                                 kind of things this other one is for                                 pages we got rid of the teaser splitter                                 made that just a little subtle link on                                 the body field that you click if you                                 need it and we replaced all of that you                                 know huge chunk of collapsed field sets                                 that was sort of mystery meat you didn't                                 know what you were getting into kind of                                 popped in there with the vertical tabs                                 pattern and that allows people to see                                 not only what the settings are that are                                 available but also what they're set to                                 so they don't actually have to click                                 into something unless they need to see                                 it so you know let's let's talk about                                 the positives with that because you know                                 we did a lot of work in Drupal                                           a long time so let's find out if it                                 actually worked or not so some of the                                 stuff did for example when we asked                                 people to add content they were able to                                 get right there um they found it and                                 it's funny actually this circles like                                 all of the places in a default                                 installation that you can get to the add                                 content screen so apparently we wanted                                 people to be able to get there but they                                 did struggle with that in Drupal                                         so these are some of the comments that                                 people said you know it's pretty simple                                 straightforward when they're asked how                                 it was to do that task so you know that                                 worked out pretty well the one exception                                 though is if some people come at this                                 kind of like you know people use                                 Dreamweaver especially come at these                                 task of like create a bout us page with                                 like oh I'll me I'll create the menu                                 item first because they're thinking in                                 terms of like I want to create my site                                 structure when they did that they didn't                                 fare as well because I don't know if                                 you've ever tried to do that but it's it                                 asks for things like a path and if you                                 try and just enter something in it says                                 that path doesn't exist yet and it's                                 kind of                                 messy but anyway but if they found the                                 ad content first page first they did                                 really well with this task everybody got                                 this distinction um so they understood                                 that when they wanted to create an about                                 Us page they create a basic page that                                 would not create an article they                                 wouldn't deliberate between the two of                                 those so that changed need to be really                                 well um they love the color module these                                 are some of the designs that they made                                 aren't they all beautiful I especially                                 like that like geocities special one                                 over there that's that's pretty cool so                                 you know they they said that that the                                 finding their way to appearance was                                 really easy in contrast to finding                                 themes because themes in Drupal                                        under site building right along with                                 modules and like                                                       so they found it really easy to find out                                 how to do this um and so this was some                                 of the comments they said there was like                                 oh that's cool you know people really                                 like the color module um but something                                 that's interesting is what color module                                 does in Drupal                                                          this sort of interactive preview thing                                 here so as you change things up in the                                 interface then it changes it down here                                 as well people love that but then the                                 problem was that it set their                                 expectations they expected to find that                                 everywhere else so expected that when                                 they for example create a piece of                                 content hit preview they wanted to see                                 it like that they want to see what does                                 that look like in the context of my                                 entire site they wanted to see what a                                 block would look like before they turn                                 it on in the context of their larger                                 site so preview was a big thing                                 overlaying toolbar despite many angry                                 comments in the issue queue seem to have                                 tested really well people found the                                 toolbar right away they thought it was                                 very well organized they were able to                                 find what they needed and then most                                 people got that uh you know you could                                 stay in the admin context and then close                                 out of it when you were done but there's                                 one person who kind of got fixated on                                 that and thought you had to click on a                                 link click the overlay clothes click on                                 another link click the overlay clothes                                 so you know if they had had a little bit                                 longer to to work on that that might                                 have helped but but but in general it is                                 it did what it was intended to do which                                 was make it clear when people were in                                 edmond context when they weren't                                 some of the first impressions people                                 said was Drupal is really simple it's                                 clearly laid out there's a lot you can                                 do not very cluttered what we did is in                                 the first minute or so of the test we                                 just ask them to just explore you know                                 take five minutes about five minutes                                 it's like two minutes just click around                                 we watched what they did and they sort                                 of go through the menu items and stuff                                 then we'd ask them what do you think and                                 so they were all pretty positive about                                 it at least at first because then the                                 trouble started not really I'll hand it                                 off to jen and she'll tell you a little                                 bit about the things that weren't tested                                 so well okay so there are a lot of                                 little problems but I'm just going to                                 kind of recap on the biggest ones that                                 we ran into the first one is Drupal                                 terminology this is not a new problem                                 there's something we've known about for                                 a long time as there are a lot of words                                 and Drupal that mean things to us as                                 people are familiar with Drupal and                                 maybe means something else to people                                 outside the Drupal community sometimes                                 people come into triple with                                 preconceived understandings of what                                 these words may mean and sometimes the                                 words had absolutely no meaning to them                                 at all so a couple examples are thing                                 looks like dashboard everybody expected                                 the dashboard to contain an                                 administrative place where they could do                                 everything on their site things like                                 structure meant different things to                                 different people everybody's used that                                 word before but not in the context of                                 building in Drupal site and then where                                 it's like module we're really confusing                                 to everyone some people thought maybe                                 with experience with other content                                 management systems that that was                                 something like a block and a whole bunch                                 people had no idea whatsoever so when                                 people were struggling with it we went                                 in and asked them like what do you think                                 a module is in there these are some of                                 the answers we got something that goes                                 on the homepage that you click on so                                 maybe a button and then hahaha I don't                                 know which is great and then some people                                 just you know I have no idea what that                                 is so expecting people to click on a                                 link to find something specific when                                 they don't even know the word and the                                 link was was also kind of problem                                 demon region names so this is the kind                                 of thing that once you understand how a                                 theme works do you understand that                                 there's different ways you can configure                                 blocks within a theme you understand the                                 different parts of themes have different                                 names for somebody who doesn't                                 understand how the system works at first                                 they don't know what a default theme is                                 let alone the name bartok so trying to                                 get someone to get that was was really                                 painful so we have a little video here                                 for you                                 um let's see i'm pretty sure bartek and                                 seven I think I was on Bartok okay                                 sidebar oh my god um header help                                 highlighted okay I don't want it to be                                 featured cuz i'm pretty sure that's um                                 like the Welcome block so Oh shipped                                 here what does that mean footer okay I                                 don't want to be funner i'm pretty sure                                 it's sidebar the first thing on the                                 sidebar so my goodness um which one is                                 which one now and seven or bars bartek                                 sidebar oh my gosh okay well I'll try                                 this one I wish she could preview what                                 I'm doing there should be a little                                 preview preview button so it's a pretty                                 good example of what we were feeling                                 and then the next biggest thing we                                 realized is that when we asked people to                                 create this little area of sponsor                                 content every single person now that we                                 gave them five ways to add content of                                 course just want to create content so                                 people didn't differentiate between                                 block content and page content as being                                 something distinctly different so blocks                                 in Drupal are always an administrative                                 thing right you go under admin site                                 building you build a block you put it                                 where it goes but every single person                                 thought of that is content which is                                 something we hadn't thought of before                                 okay so so one of the kind of more                                 overarching problems that we saw is that                                 users kind of expected visual feedback                                 of their changes no the as they're going                                 to the different side building tools                                 they're kind of getting used to that                                 wait a bit and i'll demonstrate blocks                                 or something like that you can actually                                 see some of the things that you're doing                                 and they're kind of focused on the end                                 result you know what it will look like                                 in the front end side and drupal as all                                 doesn't really accommodate well for this                                 model and an example of this is kind of                                 in the block sections as as the previous                                 participant video kind of you know it                                 they asked for a preview button and when                                 people see kind of the administrative                                 interface they do not really see how the                                 options that are shown there relate to                                 the front end web site and you know we                                 kind of have some tools to bridge this                                 gap for example with blocks we have the                                 demonstrate locks page where you kind of                                 see where stuff goes but for other parts                                 in Drupal for example the menus you                                 don't really have this model you know                                 you can't really feel where are my new                                 goes                                 and when people got to for example this                                 page and they saw the options this is                                 there they were confused where these                                 menus would go and quite often we had                                 people that thought you know we asked                                 them to put something in the net taps on                                 top they see pointed you know that's                                 where we want this link to the about                                 page to go and they saw these options                                 and they were like I don't know where to                                 go and and they often tried navigation                                 which doesn't actually help yet have to                                 pick main menu so there were some                                 confusion about the terminology as well                                 there so something like a demonstrate                                 menu page here would really really help                                 so so the demonstrate blocks page when                                 they actually got to this page they were                                 like I want to add like a block here you                                 know they were clicking on the yellow                                 part saying like that's where I want my                                 block to go and this is kind of in line                                 in in the model that people kind of want                                 to perform actions on the front end or                                 at least on their actual website rather                                 than you know being a part of some some                                 administrative context contemporary view                                 this this was a whole other issue when                                 people created content and they click                                 the preview button it actually shows up                                 in the overlay so you know the thing                                 that they're creating opens up in the                                 administrative context and I kind of                                 confuse people there like they often                                 actually missed it even they didn't see                                 where where they might be if you go and                                 other than that the actual preview                                 there's a trimmed version and a full                                 version that wasn't clear either so yeah                                 there's a whole lot we can do to improve                                 that                                 modules so so one of the the later tasks                                 that we did is to extend Drupal this is                                 really something that we introduced in                                 Drupal                                                                kind of like a dated with FTP and just                                 upload it and we thought we were testing                                 this screen I was really our expectation                                 but it turned out it wasn't really what                                 we were testing we're kind of testing                                 whether people understood that you could                                 extend Drupal and you know both extends                                 it confirmed modules but also enable                                 existing modules in core and this this                                 whole process is a bit awkward when                                 people come to the module page there                                 immediately overwhelmed and they don't                                 really notice some of the important                                 links there important information there                                 and turn to kind of scrolling down the                                 list trying to figure out what it's                                 about and this kind of makes Drupal come                                 office as limited you know the biggest                                 strength of Drupal is obviously it's                                 concert space like the ability to extend                                 it and we don't really inform them them                                 that well about this strength                                 so let me show a quick video over for                                 user trying to do this trying to                                 understand what it's about                                 not sure actually okay what do you think                                 you would see if you would click on                                 well actually i would think I'd probably                                 like the website outline but I mean I                                 saw that on a different page but that's                                 what I think of when you think of                                 modules like like the different styles                                 of the website well it's click on                                 modules and see what's there and see if                                 that how it compares to what you were                                 expecting                                 oh ok so now addition contribute in                                 matters of standing with us                                 functionality is this what you thought                                 you'd see no                                 yeah I don't know which like how what I                                 find a platform but if you'd have to                                 like redo my eyes a lot of it like                                 they've been after read through all                                 these in try to see which one is the one                                 kind that I'm looking for read them all                                 through yeah I've read all these                                 descriptions like I would I mean I would                                 hope that it be like something on here                                 under name but it's not yeah so so we                                 asked people to basically install web                                 form and well she did she obviously                                 didn't know just yet new module link and                                 that seems pretty much a pattern on                                 really busy pages that for example the                                 action links kind of get missed but when                                 they did get to Jupiter dork to kind of                                 find that particular module they were                                 confronted with this and this listing                                 just doesn't help it's it's it's really                                 difficult than they they often just miss                                 the ability to you know do a lot of good                                 searching so to show another video kind                                 of to show the importance of that that                                 they're missing that                                 oh well I was in the right page I knew                                 it um                                 oh I was on the right page I knew it um                                 registration oh my god                                 registration form no                                 great one you know what I'm on here I                                 feel like I need to create one ok                                      module developer                                 just want a simple button at a web form                                 okay maybe well I was on the right page                                 I I knew it um registration oh my god                                 registration form no                                 great one you know what I'm on here I                                 feel like I need to create more okay so                                 one of the things that you saw is she                                 didn't actually notice the the search                                 field and web form is one of the the few                                 that is actually in that actual page                                 it's like a number five or six something                                 like that so she could have just scroll                                 down and see it but she was kind of like                                 hypnotized by you know the form to                                 ability to search for it or at least                                 filter down but then she missed the most                                 important field on that which is                                 obviously the search text area so no                                 that's that's one of the things that we                                 can optimize on google dork you know                                 work on that and improve that field to                                 kind of know bring that forward more and                                 when people got to this page we saw one                                 interesting thing is that like on top                                 you have the gets instructions which                                 looks an awful lot like get instructions                                 so yeah people went there got like oh                                 yeah that's that's gonna help me and                                 when they get to that page they see this                                 okay this is not good it's not where I'm                                 supposed to be so yeah we have two real                                 able that and I was actually in Drupal                                 dork already                                 but again there's more problems when                                 they're trying to install module when                                 they get to this page or at least this                                 part of the page they're unsure what                                 version they need they often kind of                                 result to just using the top one which                                 in many cases help but in some case when                                 they at the wrong module they were                                 installing a Drupal                                                    only when they got to the part in the                                 Installer where it gives feedback where                                 you at the right version when they                                 understood that they were downloading                                 the wrong one so there's definitely                                 something we can do it doing kind of                                 improve that relation between no                                 browsing for modules and getting the                                 right one additionally the the download                                 options the tar.gz and zip that is just                                 big one it didn't really make sense the                                 differentiation there and some people                                 were like I don't know if I can get the                                 target GC to to kind of work on this pc                                 so yeah there were there were some                                 problems there and a lot of this this                                 part of the screen was kind of picked                                 randomly so there's there's room for                                 improvement there and general                                 alright so in summary there was a lot of                                 Drupal specific terminology that really                                 seemed to trip people up and we asked                                 them to perform some basic tasks and                                 people really liked the few places we                                 did have a visual representation of what                                 was actually going to happen but then                                 they expected that everywhere else so                                 everywhere we had a visual                                 representation that wasn't accurate or                                 no visual representation whatsoever                                 people seem to get really confused or                                 frustrated and not know how to proceed a                                 differentiation between blocks and                                 content was also something people had a                                 really hard time with and downloading                                 and installing modules was near                                 impossible the way our setup was                                 configured at the lab is that every                                 person was allowed to call the helpdesk                                 they had a phone on their desk that                                 called in to us and so we had one person                                 who was designated as a help desk and                                 every single person who went through                                 this usability study had to call the                                 helpdesk there was nobody was able to                                 complete all the tasks without help and                                 in the end when we asked people what                                 they thought about if they would use                                 Drupal again                                                             the helpdesk always available because we                                 were so great that you know she wanted                                 all the time um we had a the whole thing                                 was over we had a period where we got to                                 go in and ask people what they thought                                 about Drupal after they'd actually had a                                 chance to use it so in the beginning we                                 let them poke around without actually                                 trying to perform any tasks and I                                 thought that it was really great easy to                                 figure stuff out when we came back at                                 the end and said okay well now what do                                 you think their perspectives had changed                                 a little bit they said that it you know                                 it was really hard people struggled with                                 it one person thought she would need to                                 ask somebody who's a little bit more                                 technical to get her to help her through                                 it and yeah if you know what you're                                 doing it'll be fast and you can get                                 right through it if you don't know what                                 you're doing it's a little shaky and                                 confusing at first but once you get                                 familiar with it it would be fine so                                 that and then of course not as user                                 friendly as I thought after you try to                                 actually accomplish some cats                                 and the good thing is that everybody                                 even though they thought that it was                                 hard to perform some of the tasks they                                 could see that Drupal was really                                 customizable that was the number one                                 word they had all chosen to describe                                 Drupal but they also were allowed to                                 choose a out of a bunch of different                                 words to describe their experience they                                 also choose words like confusing and                                 time keeps using and too technical                                 frustrating and overwhelming so even                                 though they could see that there's a lot                                 of really good things about Drupal they                                 did also have some less than favorable                                 words to use for it so this is a                                 representation of we let them choose how                                 easy is Drupal and how valuable is                                 Drupal so everybody said you know it was                                 probably a little bit harder on the                                 usage size that I've been expected but I                                 also saw that it was also going to be                                 extremely valuable so goods and bads                                 yeah so what sex um well first I mean                                 just fix everything we found right no                                 problem no but seriously obviously you                                 know working on the issues that we found                                 you know we need to we need to do                                 additional testing you know a lot of the                                 things that we did in this round of                                 testing showed that you know changes                                 that we made in the past were helpful                                 and other things I mean there were other                                 areas where changes that we've made in                                 the past we're not effective so as we                                 continue to make changes just continuing                                 the test and make sure we're on the                                 right path is important another thing is                                 obviously attracting more designers and                                 UX people to the project and having them                                 help us I think I think everybody would                                 say that we don't have enough designers                                 and UX people right now so finding a way                                 to to get them interested in helping                                 it's a big deal and if you want to help                                 there's a handful of ways that you can                                 do it everything that we found or                                 validated is should be tagged in the                                 issue cheese with the UNM or um in                                      tag so if you're interested in looking                                 at the statuses of any of those issues                                 can filter on the issue queue by that                                 there's a usability group on group spec                                 drupal.org I recommend signing up and                                 then following what's happening there                                 there's also a Drupal community                                 initiative page for usability which is                                 basically leave going on actually                                 administers that and it has information                                 on what the UX team's priorities are and                                 what's going on in that area and also                                 there's a user experience sprint on                                 Fridays so we'll be doing some work on                                 some of these issues there as well                                 and thank you to some of the sponsors                                 for this the University of Minnesota for                                 giving its lab space drupalcamp Twin                                 Cities for for helping us out with                                 airfare and stuff like that and crimson                                 and aqua as well for donating as well as                                 a ton of individual sponsors alright                                 guess we have we have                                            yes so we have a few minutes for                                 questions anybody has them                                 of five minutes                                 I I realized this session is mainly                                 about Rupert going forward but based on                                 your usability studies a group of six or                                 seven do you have any recommendations                                 for modifications for the Drupal sites                                 we're doing now stuff we should be aware                                 of modify modules                                 what can we do now for drupal                                      improve its based on what you know                                 well in drupal                                                        things like the admin menu and that will                                 get you with toolbar at the top you                                 install it at some kind of an                                 administration theme that will get you                                 front end back in separation things like                                 that there's a I don't know the name of                                 this module but there's a module that on                                 the lights say the menu settings page                                 will let you actually create a piece of                                 content what's that I shouldn't have to                                 dribble six this like                                                    so in seven I mean a lot of what we                                 found was about brand new users who                                 would not be brand new site building                                 users who would not necessarily be your                                 customers so your customers probably                                 never going to have to find the modules                                 page themselves and things like that um                                 the actual content editing stuff that                                 actually did test pretty well um I mean                                 we didn't hit a lot of issues with that                                 kind of stuff um but but for some of the                                 the people who the biggest like content                                 editing issue we found is like blocks                                 and also with when they go into the menu                                 first and then try to create a piece of                                 content so there is a module that sticks                                 a no dad forum at the bottom of that                                 menu of page which is awesome but I                                 can't remember the name of it but                                 someone will probably tweet it or                                 something and then for the block stuff a                                 lot of people use things like panels or                                 display sweet so that your entire page                                 is just bits of content around the page                                 that's definitely the mental model that                                 people have coming into Drupal its core                                 doesn't core makes you kind of                                 differentiate between whether                                 something's a node or a block or a view                                 or a block with a view in it or you know                                 like that kind of thing but the way                                 people gently expect the web to work as                                 just little bits of content I don't know                                 that I was overly helpful we didn't get                                 a chance to test a range of things oh                                 there's one other thing which is there's                                 this google Summer of Code project that                                 integrates a web browser like a browser                                 functionality into Drupal so when you go                                 into the modules page instead of having                                 to do that janky thing where you like                                 copy and paste the URL into the the text                                 field it actually pops up kind of along                                 the lines of WordPress it pops up like a                                 big like for more you can like search                                 for modules and you see view of modules                                 and some statistics about them and stuff                                 like that that's something you know I                                 I'd love to see an initiative to get                                 that's something like that into Drupal                                   because that would that be really                                 powerful um but so there are people and                                 contributing on on some of this stuff                                 you know and the usability team is                                 working on some of it as well but you                                 know a lot of a lot of the the bigger                                 issues are more targeted towards site                                 builders than                                                           to usability test content editing                                 experience because in many cases people                                 will customize that interface for                                  whatever task their clients are trying                                  to do so it's hard to like you know test                                  that aspect if it's a lot easier to test                                  you know are we are we getting the                                  people who will actually build Drupal                                  sites to figure out Drupal's so dunno so                                  there's also the the terminology problem                                  there's a module called string overrides                                  that will let you find anything funny                                  like taxonomy and change it to category                                  so there are some things that you can do                                  to help other problems                                  my question is about graphics and                                  iconography in core in general I don't                                  know whether they're it seems to me like                                  there's there is or was a concerted                                  effort not to use iconography in Drupal                                  core that I think that came out                                  specifically the getting seven and two                                  core I feel like that the theme that                                  seven was kind of based off of a little                                  bit had a lot of different icon icons at                                  the top am I right or wrong about that                                  as far as that being a kind of a policy                                  or an unwritten rule and if either way                                  is that something that                                  you know we would consider changing but                                  one of the decisions we made with the                                  Drupal                                                                 resources in terms of icons I mean that                                  make a lot of icons but additionally to                                  that I mean yeah it was initially in the                                  proposal for the shortcut bar to have                                  icons next to the menu items and we                                  decided against that because we feel                                  it's probably unlikely for module                                  developers to create icons for their                                  modules and therefore kind of expecting                                  them to do that out of the box would be                                  kind of I don't know asking for                                  something they don't like doing in in                                  addition to that it you know what tends                                  to happen with more modular systems that                                  whenever you do something like you know                                  making it more using more icons is that                                  they get a lot of dummy icons if you                                  look at other systems that try to do                                  this you see a lot of dummy icons and I                                  mean that's not really helping so you                                  really need to kind of have that                                  community from the start like no Apple                                  has that community from the start that                                  people are you know into making good                                  icons but we don't really have that so                                  that's why we decided against it                                  can I just add to that as well on the                                  iconography front I actually contributed                                  to the Drupal                                                         biggest reasons that we were against                                  putting a lot of iconography in is that                                  icons are only really useful if the icon                                  can work in isolation from the word that                                  it represents most of the stuff that's                                  going on in Drupal we have enough                                  trouble describing in words let alone                                  trying to get it into an icon so if you                                  start trying to create icons for all of                                  this stuff actually what you're doing is                                  just creating more visual clutter more                                  cognitive overload and even though again                                  you know it's like that I what I say                                  about Drupal                                                             really great job of creating the                                  impression of a better user experience                                  and in some places creating a                                  definitively better user experience and                                  I think the testing kind of proved that                                  where you know people diem was saying                                  you know it wasn't quite as user                                  friendly as I expected it to be so I                                  think you know that's the first of many                                  steps along the road and I think that                                  iconography can sometimes do exactly the                                  same thing you look at it you go oh this                                  is going to be easy because there's                                  pictures instead of hard words                                  everywhere and then you start using that                                  you go but I don't know what any of                                  these pictures mean this is actually a                                  problem so that's that's that the trick                                  with icons and when to use them                                  you                                  yeah so I think we're a couple minutes                                  overtime so we should probably wrap it                                  up but thank you for coming
