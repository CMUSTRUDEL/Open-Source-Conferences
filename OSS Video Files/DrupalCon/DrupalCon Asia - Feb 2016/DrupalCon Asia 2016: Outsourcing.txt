00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:35,350
before we start let's just have a look

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:39,930
at this so what comes in your mind in

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,930
your cat is deficient

00:00:42,030 --> 00:01:03,160

papers etc from a bottle of gossip and

00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:10,570
the natives in ethic but la luna bespoke

00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:13,770
perfectly browned so what do you think

00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:17,040
they are moving actually are you like

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,710
you never imagine Paris Hilton doing

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,470
investment advisory or Oprah driven

00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:28,710
development all such a thing for any

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:31,210
standard already you imagine that no

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,250
however fast you may run into positive

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,890
the imagination but will be really hard

00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:41,229
to imagine but one of these are

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:42,790
successful people now why is that any

00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:48,180
guesses

00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:48,180
saying that I feel any yes

00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,270
right and right decision okay so in

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:59,670
short they're all focusing on the Google

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,780
competencies so as Bill Gates says

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,440
completion focus on their core

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,240
competencies and also everything else

00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,420

firm you do not immediately have access

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,130
to skilled employees even then companies

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,280

costs cost reduction is often listed as

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,410
one of the main reasons companies

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,580
outsource depending on your goals

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,199

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,569
incentives allow you to save blending

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:49,620

technology to keep up with a vast based

outsourcing big else's

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,730
so now that we know why outsourcing

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,020
should be done should we just get crappy

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,540
please close the session and probably

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,000
start outsourcing work would you be able

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,270
to do it right and what if you do it

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,570
wrong let's just have a look at some

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:56,420
interesting examples this one very

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,330
interesting relation between apple and a

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,460
china-based company called Foxconn

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,770
Foxconn's massive capacity of producing

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,390
iphone and other apple products I don't

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,330
really fast pace was an advantage to

00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:11,450
Apple which is why outsource work to

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,250
Foxconn however they were plenty of

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,340
reports about foxconn's of this new

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,580
treatment to its co-workers which is why

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,500
a lot of Americans were outraged and a

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,120
lot of Apple officials were embarrassed

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:29,030
in shoddy company's reputation suffered

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,670
another poster example for outsourcing

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,560
would be boy the boy was not mean to

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,930
outsourcing it had outsourced a couple

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,930
of times it it also see production of

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,030
landing gears engines and batteries to

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,430
different contractors in fact fifty talk

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:46,280
to your contractors now what it did in

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,410
the process was that it completely

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,350
surrendered the oversight of

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:54,140
subcontracting as a result of which

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,990
there were too many players doing too

00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,620
many pieces at one time with no

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,530
centralized system of quality control

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,680
well quality and buoys reputation both

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:10,130
suffered inevitably and then there is

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,680
this example of Samson so as per the

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,870
economists south korean companies do not

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,200
prefer outsourcing and they think that

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,450
American

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,000
in countries who outsource work are

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,820
making a huge mistake in outsourcing as

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,460
much manufacturing as they do this is

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,640
because they leave the other firms with

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,040
an insight to their internal processes

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,660
it's because the blueprint that Samson

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,610
followed was saying that if or when he

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,650
used to work as suck on platter for a

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,780
Japanese firm so the loss of

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,210
intellectual property security threat

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,360
and plenty of other reasons how it could

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,910
go wrong but this doesn't mean that we

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,620
should stop outsourcing that's probably

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,420
a corny because we need to make sure

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,760
that we are only focusing on our core

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,190
competencies so we still need to do it

00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,420
right there so the question here is how

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,310
do I do it right you have to make sure

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,250
that we choose the right partner when

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,250
you do outsourcing and then I say

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,140
partner think of it like this if you

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,360
have to choose a life partner would you

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,300
think of making even even the mighty to

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,670
see mistake in choosing a life partner

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,670
what could terribly go wrong if you do

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,890
one small mistake so choosing an

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,930
outsourcing partner is equivalent to

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,240
choosing a life partner because your

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,930
projects life is depending the only

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,760
choice tabulated and people have

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,970
different ideas or qualities that you

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,800
live for their partner and just some

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,700
down some of the qualities that I feel

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,700
should be important

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,200
this was my I got the quality that we

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,030
should have maybe also slower in your

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,860
partner and you should never call the

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,960
records should treat them as partners

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,730
fees until I lose you think of your

00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,010
waiter set your partner's you're not

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,230
going to have successful project so what

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,050
are your ideas or what do you think

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:09,470
should be some feeble qualities in any

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:24,330
part of you also she worked any inputs

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:26,310
for 23 or so insured need to have the

00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:30,120
bare minimum quality to your part of the

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,490
axles about 20 now now that you move

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,350
qualities are you need to use in order

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,870
to charge somebody while you're also

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:41,010
seeing your project the next question

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,510
that comes is how do I go about it so

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,810
the first thing that you do on the list

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:48,300
is ask yourself and ask a lot of

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,820
questions as many as you can because you

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,610
first need to know where you with help

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,350
how much help is required and what is it

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,720
at night by which you need to get will

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,420
help you be so you need to ask yourself

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,270
these questions once you have your

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,130
requirements you need to have a very

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,900
crisp checklist based on your

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,210
requirements now that way in from

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,070
poverty project though is they can

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,230
always be a jetway checklist but then

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,750
patiently requirements the dentist will

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,760
die so you pretend you're ticklish from

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,380
the valuation retirement all your

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,430
requirements that you need to get done

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,860
in your browser itself after that make

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,720
sure you will go to just one partner or

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,330
you will just lightly go and pick up

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,330
what are you it's always good to have

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,300
good prospects so you going to find out

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:40,340
a couple of prospects who can become

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:43,470
other which one can become your father

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,780
and then why you do that in to choose

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,990
whether the person the the popular you

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,010
are picking up is right there was no not

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,550
so you have to make sure that these

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,710
shores of swallowing place so which one

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:59,250
will you choose gaining a list of

00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,800
prospects is properly simply you can

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,610
always get that make

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,470
publicity listen but which one do you

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,440
choose and how you go-go juice into the

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:14,060
right partner well in order to do so

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,490
first you need to make sure that you

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,310
follow the simplest possible criteria

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,010
for fat research which is thus we see

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:26,600
criteria as we know it compatibility

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:31,940
capability and commitment is ever in the

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:38,149
room here aware of Drupal yes sir is

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:40,579
pants right so now that I am just

00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,200
focusing on percentage audience I talk

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:46,010
about how you are so sleepy little

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,140
projects so they saw these three

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,279
materials we talk about each one tell me

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:54,110
take this is just a bit so basically

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,920
what is it we decide how we go out to

00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:00,410
the oxygen parking and the reason why I

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,220
pick up choosing this this is the topic

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,680
is because we got a project and there

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,690
are so I expect in the throat me realize

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,899
that there were countless news from

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,329
different companies and not one not two

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,459
not filled by a different companies we

00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:19,130
were actually the right one and my

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:22,070
question was not widely the night my

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:25,490
question was how much pain how much

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:28,250
money how much time was spent by client

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,040
in order to go over it doing something

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,510
getting built nothing so they spend of

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,370
our family money we're actually got

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,579
nothing in return so that was

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,600
communication point and I when we came

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,850
up with this

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,279
sweet redhead choosing a combative

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:47,120
partner when you talk about

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,190
compatibility you have to make sure that

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,250
the parking issues with your legal value

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,860
to work without working partner and here

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,790
mostly mostly outsourcing happens maybe

00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,709
countries which have different samples

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,269
deny also were 12 when your boyfriend's

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:04,220
everything is happening in class

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,350
different you also have to take care of

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,829
the cost benefits that you can get out

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,779
of outsourcing so you use across tots

00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,690
actually outsourcing and then you learn

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:18,019
how to make sure how manageable and

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:21,350
cross-cultural and corporate culture

00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:23,089
differences so both of you are cultures

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,259
need to align in some way or the other

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:29,660
at least in in the vision of fold so in

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,819
terms of in terms of your goals how you

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,279
can manage the time zone differences in

00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:36,050
language differences and better you our

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,329
work ethics align with your partner and

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:42,560
aaj leave some in shape factors to our

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:44,870
way now language is not the only factor

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,269
and I'm you should not come thru out for

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,579
internal languages but it's also about

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:52,160
the vocabulary of the terminology that

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,959
can use in order to communicate to each

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,630
other and understand be required to

00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,819
write for example what I have concerns

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,680
of a module will be very different off

00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:02,380
what a person who will not take a

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,940
background would

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,800
simply make sure that these missions

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,140
with sessions you cover the same page

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
and you have to develop that

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,310
understanding required is very easily

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,260
and again the number one is asked many

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,420
questions as many questions as possible

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,500
a lot can go wrong with you don't ask

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,160
for any questions last analysis

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,500
management practices we know that

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,080
developers are eludes without them the

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,700
open source project with rt delivered to

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,040
trust mean cause balances or stars

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,780
without that you cannot the chances of

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,940
having successfully deliver everything

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,970
is lame so to make sure that you have a

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,620
right wanted contact is where did I put

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,960
probably understand their language and

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,490
their me because of what they move but

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,050
it will make sure that some reason these

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,760
lands in it as well I hope it's

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,790
something from your partnership as well

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,940
both have that non-technical language of

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,100
conversational girl because if you were

00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,200
clearly need to get done and then why do

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,640
you do that if you choose whether the

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,819
person look the part where you're

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,230
picking up is right there was no not so

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,680
you have to make sure that these shorts

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,319
it's fall in place so which one will you

00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,650
choose painting a list of prospects is

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,569
properly simply you can always get back

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,900
on recommendations as well publicity

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:23,740
kicks in but which one do you choose and

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,740
how you go up to

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:31,289
well in order to do so force you to make

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,150
sure that you follow the simplest

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:36,210
possible criteria for parking search

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,760
which is the sluicey criteria as we know

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:43,559
it too far ability capability and

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:52,860
commitment is ever going to hear aware

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:55,590
of Drupal the answer is fans right so

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,179
now that I am focusing on Pacific

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,990
audience I talk about how you do a

00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:03,330
socially political projects so based on

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,039
these three materials we talk about each

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,929
one of them in detail but this is the

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,330
gist of it so based on what are these

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:13,080
feel anything what do you decide how we

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:15,779
go back to the oxygen parking and the

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,149
reason why I wake up choosing this this

00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,659
is a topic please because we got a

00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:23,640
project and there are so I expecting

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:25,529
without me realize that there were

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,950
competitions from different companies

00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:30,720
and not one not two not three but a

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,450
different companies we were actually the

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,779
nice one and my question was not widely

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:39,510
the night my question was how much pain

00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:43,830
how much money how much time was spent

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:46,409
by client in order to go about it doing

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,360
something game built nothing so they

00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:50,820
spend a lot of money but I actually got

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,730
nothing in return so that was a real

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,620
pigeon point and I when we came up with

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,890
this

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:02,520
choosing a combative partner when we

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,380
talk for compatibility you have to make

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,090
sure that the parking issues with your

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,300
little value to work without working

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,610
partner and here mostly mostly

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,850
outsourcing happens maybe countries

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,650
which have different time zones can also

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,290
work to work when you're presented with

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,420
it is hardly any cars different you also

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,760
have to take care of the cost benefits

00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,790
anything get out of outsourcing so you

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,830
do the cross-talk actually outsourcing

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,740
and then you learn you have to make sure

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:34,640
how manageable are you cross cultural

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:38,040
and cross corporate culture differences

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,590
so both of your cultures need to align

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,830
in some way or the other at least in the

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:46,290
vision of fold so in terms of in terms

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,060
of your goals how you can manage the

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,340
time zone differences in language

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,110
differences and whether you are work

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,450
ethics align with your partner or not

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:59,370
need some extra practice to run away now

00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,440
language is not the only factor and then

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,090
you should not come throw up for

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,610
regional languages but it's also about

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,980
me vocabulary of the terminology that we

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:11,220
use in order to communicate to each

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,780
other and others can be required by for

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,330
example what I have understandable

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,160
module will be very different off what a

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,260
person who may not be a bad one would

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,880
understand in the morning so you can

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,130
make sure that truly wishes with

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,680
sessions you come on the same page and

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,840
you have to develop that understanding

00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,300
with wire which I easily and again the

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,190
number one is asking questions as many

00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,560
questions

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:37,880
a lot can go wrong if you have any

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:41,300
questions last analysis management

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,000
practices we owe that developers are

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,220
eludes without them we'd open source

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,710
particular key delivered but trust me

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,120
cause balances or stars without that you

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,060
cannot the chances of having

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,470
successfully delivered mini slim so to

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,050
make sure that you have a right point of

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,390
contact is where did I put probably

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,370
understand their language and very thick

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,440
ass upon the moon but it will make sure

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,700
that some recently transit is well I

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,980
hope it's something from your

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,260
partnership as well both have that

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,470
non-technical language of conversation

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:15,350
as well because it but you may not be

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,390
able to look it straight but you should

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,820
have enough trust on your on your choice

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,650
and partners anything to tie him for

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,930
such things and it might be very

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,550
important research that you miss out and

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,620
take it one other if you delete

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,100
something like this in fact my spirits i

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,530
can say you also get X plus y teacher

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,220
body so that that way misconceptions you

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,220
won't have to try

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:49,400
talk about an apple successful

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,340
partnerships will try I guess there was

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,700
Alicia probably implies not being

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:59,180
treated well that is great right how

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,360
they fixed it is a back in the in

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:05,000
context like not choosing happens from

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,900
outside how do they did hit an order

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,240
like people treat their people well how

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,730
do you assure them that you do that and

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,980
where is it like I don't see anything

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,070
any cultural implication how does the

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,910
person across like saying los angeles

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:25,160
california new york know that the

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,900
company I'm outsourcing with the

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,870
actually Molly replies well paying them

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:34,060
the web how does it show how do you guys

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:37,730
do that so if you really want to judge

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,770
on why is it off in culture or what kind

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,520
of activities they do but they're boys

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,440
are you happy or not one easy we not a

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,060
very nice

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,800
we are doing that will be checking your

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,900
company's website from lofts in

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,540
particular written by mortgage or not

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,880
culture which are not develop that

00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,890
recently blocks by cultures and he loves

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,110
people and that would not be written by

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,910
company officials they will be enjoy

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,230
your threads for you it will

00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,060
probably be published ratings of

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,310
companies content drinking always check

00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,590
out blogs and work on that now is the

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,510
time social media go check out the

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,170
company's Facebook page then we got it

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,880
also feature depicting cockneys cultures

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:18,190
that yes that depends on the kind of

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,170
something you are hiding it will be very

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,320
difficult to find out the culture of the

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,750
company which is very huge because the

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,930
path inver outsourcing or the smaller

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:31,090
things are also true given aren't able

00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,130
to specifically find out that particular

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,810
part in the movie we can do some work

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,180
for me one of the company is a home

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:40,590
where you can always check out so damn

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,590
go here so extend

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:57,340
which i have seen being walking into

00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:01,090
sales and pre-sales typically when they

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,490
release the RFI then rfp RFI itself they

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,260
will have no heart of bushes what is

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,320
your thought of condom what is your

00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:11,530
judgment talent management whatever what

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,320
about your privacy policies or what

00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,930
about your security stuff and whole lot

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,150
of quality in all that set of questions

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,820
they'll ask in rfid which is not very

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:25,870
high level rather and then then when you

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,550
go to rfp with they in Vietnam and when

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,530
you get further selected for the

00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,690
presentation in defining negotiation

00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,960
they really really get everything

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,790
martinique so that's a I see but loving

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,130
the digital wallet you see all the

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,920
social medias and gone and all that even

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,690
that gives you more clear picture you'll

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,850
always ask for information when you

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,740
don't believe again we have to knock us

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,810
if you don't believe that information

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:55,740
providing up-to-date okay enough is

00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:59,460
opening yet yeah just too actually

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:03,059
nice place for a morning like you see

00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:10,230
lot of companies doing contribution from

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:14,460
the cosmati building that special open

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:18,330
source Thank if any company is masking

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:22,640
you going to keep dr. developer that's

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:25,290
also smell I think I get that so if

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,500
companies can do that that speaks about

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:31,830
the trust that you could be as they are

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,640
masking is something wrong I know some

00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,640
companies like

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:42,100
I think that will if anyone that answer

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,100
gives a confidence for time

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,170
and I'm Manson is the kind of confidence

00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,679
that you know you can have it of the

00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,690
interface directly with a client and

00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,510
company has trust and culture is very

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,700
open otherwise right now there is few

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,850
favorite people going put stuff in wash

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,280
your vagina averages of the ratings ops

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,080
constant they became out from the box is

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,390
both sides of stuff it was intro-

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,090
reporting right which is very difficult

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,850
into the small companies writing yes I

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,980
think these are things which people do

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:35,510
come please put the employees in the

00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:37,520
front and they can break in the face you

00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:40,429
raise the issue which was related to

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,980
many of comedy sitting in u.s. they are

00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:45,370
also sick a project

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,990
which is not that they're right so say

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,630
there is a language barrier also a

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,059
developer may be best at coding things

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,770
right but may not be there said you know

00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:55,600
negotiated or dealing with the clients

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,640
directly so there that's where the

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,500
interface is also acquired but at least

00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,179
when we when we talk about culture of

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,590
the organization you know which are who

00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,750
you believe in that there are certain

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,940
value system that pick up keep sitting

00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,530
in u.s. have and if certain very system

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,630
that because of me sitting in India has

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,120
right if there is a map between the note

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,860
maybe a small nap maybe not everything

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,870
would be right but any couple of things

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,610
if they are not it okay i'm at a comfort

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,130
zone okay they have a certain value

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:25,900
system which is not good mind and i can

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:29,290
talk about it is good in the beginning

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:32,110
linear outsourcing predictability you

00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:35,470
stay developers for you but for katie of

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,179
reasons one being that you cannot be

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,179
shown earlier today also since we cannot

00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:42,370
change a diaper time in dupage sales so

00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:44,230
they make me not for developer as a face

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,820
in the company they will put somebody

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:50,700
else

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:54,169
something that if I do you can always

00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:57,779
talk to and we're always ask the vendor

00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:59,250
directly is it okay if I speak to your

00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,630
preferences the people that you

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,059
mentioned as references they should be

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,620
good to talk about you Ray so you can

00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:08,309
always ask for the references they would

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:10,460
know that if when because what happens

00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:12,330
is that when a project is in progress

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,250
you would always see the team

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,139
interacting with a client directly that

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:20,250
happens and when the teams interact with

00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:23,460
lines then you see that that openness or

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,370
that the employee culture that comes out

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,779
during those conversations but if it's a

00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,490
little hard to know that in the very

00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:31,139
beginning so to move that you can do

00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,330
that reference check and social

00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:35,700
media-based working law of course not

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,440
the larger purpose but let me make off

00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,929
you got post written by Kathleen

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,440
provides here and then that hurts and

00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,480
like we mentioned the outs are the open

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,549
source occupations any company who

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:56,700
doesn't have a good culture may not

00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:59,340
promote yeah so nomination speech

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,500
and laughter the list was communication

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:04,179
so everything apart if you cannot use a

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,120
separate project if there is improper

00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:08,980
communication from all ends whether it

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,500
is questions from the developers or

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,090
questions from the pre-sales feed our

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,070
questions come new client who is

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,360
outsourcing the questions have to come

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,700
and they have to come on the right way

00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,630
so you can really really well

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,929
communication is if you have a

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:26,580
successful project outsource say now is

00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:29,200
all of it that's how each event partner

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,360
there are other things as well which

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,029
will be specific to your projects so she

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,580
having additional questions you can

00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:38,500
write to me will be my card you can

00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,840
write to me or you can follow directly

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,880
or you can also mean he has a conscience

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,289
vote if needed for now we just have a

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,440
quick question on your section in there

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:52,029
are recent questions here how okay yes

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,610
that's a good question how do you

00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:57,190
identify what you need to outsource so

00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:03,190
here percentages like to know what

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:05,049
exactly are you doing right now okay I'm

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:09,100
do you have an in-house activity

00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:11,400
yesterday okay a fresh team are a very

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,610
strong week

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,530
relatively strong okay so here I really

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:21,670
think you would need to also develop it

00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:24,760
work but if you are just started and you

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:27,790
want clients ok so the outsourcing of

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,800
masking that can be that you can always

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,510
change that is if you really needed if

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,700
you're getting clams on your own you do

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,680
not even need to hire somebody else to

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,680
do the marketing stuff so first question

00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,350
is what ever you mean you really need

00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,940
help in any any any domain of course the

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,520
wine is marketing other one is a

00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:48,310
recruitment and we may have look at the

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,900
item system right so again right thing

00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,610
is I development because you are already

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,350
already ready to be strong so you would

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,940
not need to hire up an agency for

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,290
development putting definitely need

00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,240
partners who can help you with

00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,520
recruitment and they are going you need

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,860
to make sure it I give each one standout

00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,330
although there are fences and all the

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,429
contributions are not will be different

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:10,820
then princess

00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:15,390
of their garden shop then kynesha

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:17,789
platinum edition to get you to identify

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,679
their help you need you need help in

00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:21,390
marketing like you said you also

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,289
partially or questioning away you need

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:28,500
help in marketing I'm still its way it's

00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:32,159
a situation of dynamic today outsourcing

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,419
my accounts and not sure if you also

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,799
assist with the right partner because

00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:37,230
there are people who knew about

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,330
management who are managing finances

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,460
obviously if I think we will know where

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,650
our tax management see she does it

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,179
family as other over so they are people

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,830
to do that we have to make sure they be

00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,250
trusted

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:51,169
go directly and the choice of that will

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,480
again be depending on how you use your

00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,190
prospects so that happy hour thing but

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,630
again the first question is what do you

00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:04,580
mean with a lot source does your

00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:07,460
organization does any answers no it's

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,690
other way I see Ariana actually the

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,399
reason and their business talk is

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,450
because I just found these are problems

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,760
that other people are missing an

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:17,809
outsourcing and the things that me

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,510
realize we offer as consultants after

00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:22,190
which so even off-topic leg not really

00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,799
related to project work but as

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:28,190
consultants if we offer some advice how

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,470
our clients take it that tacky no sign

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,269
of a voice from the night maybe there

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,340
ever is talk about how to invest in

00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:36,320
becomes really difficult to find the

00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,159
right partner some of the companies one

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,529
they also know is the higher third party

00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,809
google expert to check in with you on

00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,710
your technical skills because you have

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,409
at it

00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,539
that really depends on your budget so

00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:53,120
that is something just it has to be cost

00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:54,919
effective on you it so I do not feel

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,630
during the presentation but that is what

00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,630
you want then again so we take

00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,960
interesting though we are good at

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,940
development development is kind for

00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,980
brats not come back you know how they

00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,590
say oh we do have hosting that also part

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,419
of development so you are wondering if

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,480
we should have a warning for those ducks

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:21,559
should we outsource that depends on cost

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,539
again so it has to be cost effective you

00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:26,330
are completely the game development and

00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:29,029
by delicate I mean coding and Excise

00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:31,100
elaborate Etsy or something that I don't

00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:33,200
really feel that add another show needs

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,200
to hire a different agency or together

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,840
maybe hire people to do the AC over

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,210
because it has to be cost effective in

00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,029
the end you cannot move the on your

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,860
budget and higher or go and suck on

00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:48,080
track multiple things to multiply net

00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:52,179
have a shorewood of managing all of that

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,179
we actually will done gardening a house

00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:06,390
he needs to hire this or leather purse

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:07,980
keep talking so posting or manager there

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,340
has to be more initiative everything

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:15,570
going to interrupt the ring actually my

00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:17,970
little always develop so depends on how

00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:20,100
can be something work if you if you are

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,600
self a little background and you can

00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,880
understand it a little job in the

00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,460
beginning you can interact with the

00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,800
technical thing as well and they could

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,630
speak technically to you but if not then

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,490
you will always have work on the Ponte

00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,200
in your partner also seen your work

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,510
group who we will understand your

00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,860
language which is non technical and give

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,560
you the solution even with that same

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,859
language suppose there were cultured

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,929
house

00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:47,960
vicious difference how it is all in sync

00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:49,879
with that what kind of insulin

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,760
Eddie Eddie company have different

00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:55,099
vision right now the goal of the company

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,330
my company has a different way we have

00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:01,120
mostly Australian consulate of delirium

00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:03,760
a hierarchical agnostic so how do you

00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,300
score and see whether I'm student I have

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,220
no idea what I'm just asking are these

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,130
yes you should ask these questions to go

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,540
into the apartment self assume what is

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,400
your company culture if you have a

00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,680
flapper are key or you have a level

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,990
hierarchy and people directly come and

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,670
talk to talk to you see you or if they

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:24,670
have to go through levels and then copy

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,680
that so Mike Napoli has that your key

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,800
anybody are going up to anyone no

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,050
questions asked so I think that's Fangio

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,610
wait or probably when your postures

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,130
which is also something important or

00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,640
incomplete you mean well for infinitely

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,900
happy and you would not want that either

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,730
percentage above you is now you're

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,770
talking term for you you know is

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,350
everything is you have ready because

00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:50,050
this your senior on speaking we can

00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:54,340
greatly book that matter have been

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:57,190
actually good point oh man i want to ask

00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:00,130
permission now i am a user group

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:03,040
actually and you go to migrate our

00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:05,680
website to Google ok now after coming

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,200
here and it is understood that is

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,869
completely different

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,480
something which is the proper ID managed

00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:15,089
services they like in the past we had a

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,579
IT services which very much you know i

00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,990
would say scream like that Drupal is

00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:21,150
something it's an open source platform

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,910
so we need their lovers who have

00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,849
contributed or work on brutal for Rama

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,190
period of time now I as I need to

00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:31,470
migrate my website again in talking

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,079
about in new berlin you know how is

00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:37,440
outsourcing works or it should I be

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,750
trying to hire someone in-house or it

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,170
will be better for me to you know our

00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,900
sources so sure apart from first one

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,119
what if at any time if you decide of

00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,060
hiring somebody in-house training the

00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,670
person and then gets out infrastructure

00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,520
costs of providing facilities and

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:59,400
laptops and other logistics so that cost

00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,920
and then outsourcing your work to a

00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,089
little developing shop who can do it who

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,790
are already skill they have done

00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:07,980
something similar before so it depends

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:11,240
on what you prefer do you have enough

00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,530
time and money to spend on training and

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,569
infrastructure not not and you

00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:19,140
should definitely go out so you know I

00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:21,630
we can hire households but after my lady

00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:26,010
and do we need any director for a long

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:27,730
time independent and project but in

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,349
general

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,900
technical agency to support it it's a

00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,789
CMS so the content management is really

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,470
simple provided you hire the right

00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:38,839
person who does a very simplified

00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:41,150
architecture so you sure your first

00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,250
requirement is you want a simplified

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,380
website whose quality management is

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,230
simple enough for you who doesn't have

00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,690
things drupal expertise to understand

00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:52,460
that i mean with our mental illnesses if

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,619
you want value additions or little

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,150
features will be added in future you

00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:58,400
will go back to that shop or maybe

00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,559
having shop they should be optimization

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,380
again depending on where you go back to

00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,970
but then the syllabus is viable in

00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,619
itself is that it needs to be simple

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,450
enough reason for me standing so you

00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:10,970
will not need to have again how the

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,220
routine you manage the target so I have

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,380
let you know from the content specialist

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,690
people so they basically new authoring

00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,839
and then you have a huge market in D

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,760
which are completely gone technical so

00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,559
meaning to blame them you know once we

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,030
migrate they obviously need to train

00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,460
them as they should be able to hold on

00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,770
route Alicia behavior surface we in the

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,680
cleaning to manage for dinner grouping

00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:36,140
is very simple depending on the length

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,890
of huge the volume of the website if

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:42,070
clean base and ready

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,660
money and that's maximum but I am

00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,610
already gone for months month-long

00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,560
training removing the right amount of

00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,510
feelings otherwise intervals in the

00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,180
project either probably doing which is

00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:55,390
five laser painting and he was a foreman

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,010
managers was the content authors do not

00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,380
let themselves they don't even think

00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:03,640
that we're seeing a if you know

00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:06,580
just how to use a laptop okay one more

00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,890
thing I am uncertain of is on an order

00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,710
if there are new versions of the way

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,810
that gets launched do I need to appeal

00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:18,580
they upgrade my website kill the new

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:20,980
version in the longer run you need 15

00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,260
you know maybe maybe to use on the line

00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:26,350
okay I don't think two years on the line

00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,540
you have another one Triple H took a lot

00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,150
of time you come and in the latest paper

00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,820
we probably share unversed migrating

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:36,520
from a drupal version to the next group

00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,380
aversion who becomes injured in fact

00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,050
without group a really nice they were

00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,540
already 57,000 class websites on

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:46,210
replayed suggest imagine the power of

00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:49,000
google that without actually having to

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:50,950
pull a specific of everything whenever

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,390
without the proper abilities they were

00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,970
people who were already started illinois

00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:59,780
removing the very hard to my greater

00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:01,280
I probably get off me a few thousand

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,619
eyes you might have things to do that

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,060
that's why I'm just guessing I don't

00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:07,099
know yet that you would not be that with

00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,580
you do it and you do not have to do it a

00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:15,410
big nose nose and into the ocean theme

00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:18,320
comes Alex I'm okay one last question of

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:22,670
great fewmets there are two types of

00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:30,089
objects unit one is a major religion

00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:32,180
this is like 8.1 8.2 1.15 and released

00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:35,160
they publish something called who is not

00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,619
literally stood and see that really is

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,200
not has something to do with yourself if

00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:42,539
it is a security release and if that

00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,819
security degrees affects your side do it

00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:47,459
immediately give insecure image that

00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:50,219
does not have any pattern is it because

00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:52,920
postponed to next available it's not

00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:54,539
mandatory to always a bit but you have

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,650
to read the release notes and then

00:40:54,539 --> 00:41:01,559
decide what okay thanks and that is

00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:05,309
usually not the problem a one last

00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:07,950
