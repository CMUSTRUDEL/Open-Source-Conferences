era so Drupal 8 is a meta project

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,639
comprised of a lot of pieces that our

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,500
friends have helped us outfit and we

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,320
wanted to give you a taste of this

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,030
paradigm so there's a lot of soft stuff

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,770
about what people think is what the

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,000
intention is we sort of focusing this

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,460
relationship a little bit through the

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,100
lens of the PHP framework

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,859
interoperability group and camel has a

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,570
few technical examples of why this ends

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,550
up making our lives easier and better

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,800
why we can make more of a difference and

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,649
so on so the concept of the six-hour

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,649
session is that we have done up to this

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:41,670
one seven or eight interviews with

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:45,930
prominent PHP people of projecting

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,420
taters sort of what we do call Beth long

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,059
a you know be four journalists developer

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:57,420
person and we've got about four coming

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:59,460
so is radar session please if you think

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,530
it's worth anything um there's a series

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,910
of podcasts that I'm releasing so we're

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,049
thinking of this session is a kind of an

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,850
ongoing conversation showing you how we

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,049
learn what we learned what we discovered

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,400
and it would be great if you could come

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,920
and listen to those I've got the URL

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,729
coming up in a second but this is like

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,850
going to be an ongoing a relationship I

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,250
guess and you can contact us ask

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,960
questions we can produce new material

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,740
and we're definitely submitting this to

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
the next couple

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,520
cause if we're going to let it grow and

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,899
we're doing newer interviews so that's

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,549
kind of the ad for the overall content

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:41,939

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,410
Campbell courtesy and again look here

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,910
for me right so as we said all of the

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,040
interviews we're doing to prepare this

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,470
are being posted online there's one with

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,940
Larry Garfield already up today one is

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,470
coming out before the Mitchell and in

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,810
the next few weeks like I said they're

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,670
going to be at least six more positively

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,090
seven or eight or infinite number of or

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,640
we'll see how that goes hey so meets the

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,820
PHP framework gives our operability

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,640
group a few years ago bunch of people

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,620
got together in PHP and they said hey so

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,570
we're incredibly siloed we've got this

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,680
problem that you know I'm a drupal

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,680
developer your

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,769
of PHP BB developer euro simply

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,989
developer Europe then developer and all

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,690
done and the community was quite

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,460
fractured wasn't talking much and we

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,919
were certainly as we were of a big part

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,210
of this problem and they said hey like

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,490
so usually 5.3 we got main spacing that

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,320
means I can bring in variables with the

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,850
same name or hacking him the day cos you

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,110
can add a class with your pruners it and

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,360
we can still make them play nice

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,430
together well hey presto why he wasn't

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,310
in five point Oh Larry you'll have to

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,690
explain later click the quick that is

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,580
actually wonderful that we have a

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,289
destitute put you on the spot oh yeah

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:56,400
periodic but as soon as we get something

00:04:49,289 --> 00:05:03,660
wrong word get in the water server and

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:04,979
another copy HP tech in 2010 9z I hope

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,570
some people said hey so we've got the

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,460
same fisting what if we can auto load

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,139
all the stuff that we need in together

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,389
there's this order living standard

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,570
created and a group they call themselves

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,580
the PHP standard and everybody hated

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,320
them and because they said you were

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,570
using standard whatever they got really

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,590
quiet for a while um but this

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,550
autoloading turned out to be really

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:29,460
useful so today it's a group of several

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,139
dozen project leads or not only

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,930
frameworks but also projects like

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,229
composer a bunch of the things who are

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,760
working together to define the new era

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,130
that we're getting so the

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,900
interoperability area in PHP the reason

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,460
that Drupal 8 can use Symphony

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,919
components and external libraries that

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,090
puzzle is because of these standards

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,979
because its efforts to become

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,020
interoperable and I can also say that

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,990
the result is in the last few years all

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,670
of a sudden there are universal PHP

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,530
lives there people coming together

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,900
as I PHP world where you have a Drupal

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,330
track in edge of the track and a gentle

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,620
track and universal interesting topics

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,920
for everybody and people are really

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,800
really excited to be in PHP now many

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,660
more people are saying Hannah PHP so

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,970
that's kind of the headspace that we'd

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,200
like to make you into we are now part of

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:21,720
the broadest on fraction in PHP and

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,470
we're incredibly relevant and people are

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,600
incredibly excited to have you know

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,550
37,000 um new brands happening about

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,860
with our pubs and we get stuff in return

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,540
like all of the city framework taking

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,100
care of some heart problems for us as a

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,320
commodity we get better security in that

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,840
setting so why should you care as a

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,330
developer well frankly he makes your day

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,950
way way way easier with some of the

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,450
magic some of the external libraries and

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,880
the things that we've gotten along the

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,460
way for free while I find the audio

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,540
cable different up to partying say

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,690
something this one haha alright so I'm

00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,400
gonna make a personal confession way

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:06,600
back before PHP fig i had a library of

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,340
wordpress jokes and joomla jokes

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,100
did anybody else make fun of the other

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,600
frameworks like I did a show of hands

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,540
who feels a little bit guilty about

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,490
being a jerk about that well I think too

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,990
much my to go I think we're press the

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,240
only one you can still make jokes about

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,370
therapy oh yeah we're supposed to so

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,320
many jokes about we request is because

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,320
they're the they're not making any moves

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:38,130
we wanted so we should Chancellor's into

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:41,640
it aggressive so I have some very very

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,350
quick sound bites to show you as we go

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,050
through the presentation from different

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,810
people that we've spoken with when our

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,640
ongoing learning about PhD thing and

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,380
this context that we're in so these are

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,020
really really short basically sort of

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,280
saying hi but these are teasers as well

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,560
for the podcasts that are coming out of

00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,510
the next few weeks and the first weapon

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,770
is with my great friend Laura Mitchell

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:07,290
who is a great PHP traitor and it's all

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,760
said she writes a lot of materials she

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,080
and I have done a few things together

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,230
choose the person who actually

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,340
introduced me to the PSR standards in a

00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:19,890
blog post called pierce on well and as I

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:24,230
said this you will be able to find later

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,230
today on popular calm side pockets

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,750
really if you have to take a few that I

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,390
am super excited to see Drupal in being

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,360
just so much parks PhD be safe a piece

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:44,210
of google com and seeing the museum in

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,540
Drupal 8 makes me very very very happy

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:51,050
so have a great ripple car and I will be

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,400
around an event or initiative so I just

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,770
want to say if you see the name Laura

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,690
Mitchell on any piece of media it's

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,430
worth reading and she has been to a

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,690
bunch of rubicon so look out for her at

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:06,230
some community event at someone what's

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,460
really exciting for us as developers and

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,170
this is that all of a sudden our

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,970
community is strong and we have people

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,620
who traditionally would feel like oh

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,810
they couldn't really touched rupal it's

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,090
too much of its own universe and now

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,850
they actually care now they all want to

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,980
deal with and do a podcast interview

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,540
with them and they say oh I'm so happy

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,600
to hear about the release of Drupal 8

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,820
you contributed so much for to what I do

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,430
of course vice versa so the way that

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,340
actually works I need to be failed is

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,940
more than just a nice looking website

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,250
and some

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:41,150
I need to talk to they get together and

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,090
define standards of PSRs and the

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,100
standard behaviors are all optional just

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,570
because you're a PHP fig member project

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,370
doesn't mean you have to do all of them

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,770
but it means that you are encouraged and

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,350
of course the more of you got the more

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,020
interoperable of your code that is the

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,750
more benefit your your code gets from

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,490
everybody else out there community so

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,140
Drupal 8 does not adopt all of the PSRs

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,260
thanks enoree yeah in fact it looks very

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,060
few but it's partly because we're

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,700
planning it really early in the viet our

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,330
lifetime yeah how many kids are where

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:21,200
they're so first of all Jim what

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:27,380
PSRs does Google 80 dogs I would say on

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:31,310
a hunch he is on 34 and he is our eighth

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:35,120
that's a very good punch I typed them to

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,950
beacon of myself so PS are three is a

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,180
logging standard it defines how you

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,340
should interact with your with your

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,380
logging but basically it's a logger

00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,360
interface that's one of the first ones

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,660
that we got into PSR for is the

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,490
autoloader jam mentioned that before

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,830
effectively it's a way to have a single

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,020
call to load a library that has a ton of

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,450
dependencies and you don't have to worry

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,520
about any of it you actually can just

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,680
write your class quite easily and get

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,240
all the components that you need when i

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,610
was talking about drupal contributing to

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,310
the broader PHP world sincerely the

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:10,220
proposed PSR eight standard is part of

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:14,810
that from me and it's exporting Drupal's

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,910
culture of hugs as an interface standard

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,980
so PHR eight is the huggable interface

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,080
and I true I honestly truly believe that

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,420
our community in our community spirit is

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,890
the most important in the strongest

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,410
thing that we have and I think it's

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,710
incredibly cool that Larry who is Drupal

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,170
High Representative to the PHP fig group

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,100
has proposed that and and I want to see

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,440
the doc that I think is really awesome

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,880
so some people think it's a joke but I

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,019
think it's actually a really really

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,730
beautiful

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,410
Larry never jokes about hugs talk about

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:51,220
the rest here for a psychic overheard

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:52,629
and rubicon so oh you're gonna fall for

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,220
that that was a hug week this is our

00:11:52,629 --> 00:12:00,459
community yeah so jam what PSRs does

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,990
drupal 8 not adopt well you know the

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:05,110
really baseline ones that everybody

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:08,050
always adopts the coding standard and

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,939
the coding style somehow we didn't quite

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,610
get there but i think frankly it comes

00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:15,759
down to the fact that for us two spaces

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,249
is the run to one true way right and the

00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,889
PSRs have are completely deluded and

00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:23,740
have said that it's tab so we're pulling

00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:25,899
out if somebody said that we should know

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,509
what are they for force well my god

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,129
somebody yes somebody came over and said

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:34,240
that we should switch to four spaces but

00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:36,370
don't worry we burned the hair is so

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,350
that's psl one and two actually we're

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,519
very close to PS are one there are some

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,160
details that we don't it off but

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,740
fundamentally we already have a really

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,559
well written clearly defined coding

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,509
style guide that actually most community

00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,629
members tend to follow and it's a lot of

00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,730
work to switch coding standards to all

00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:57,220
of a sudden even let's say without

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,809
having to retrain 37,000 Drupal

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,629
development all over the world to press

00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:04,540
space four times I then just can't do it

00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:07,240
eyes it's very hard even without the

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,100
training problem let's just any

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,649
volunteers to go to the Drupal codebase

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,300
right and reformat the whole thing yeah

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,300
we so we talked about that with Larry

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,060
right so I'm just hiking with their own

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,530
and we'll see if that if that ever

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,720
graduate if that changes in the future

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:27,620
it is a bit tricky to have separate

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,240
settings in your IDE PSR 5 has not been

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,270
officially ratified yet and it's a

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,680
documentation standard so we have really

00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,010
good documentation I think that we could

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,380
actually look to the symphony community

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,360
to see how great documentation is done

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,450
but in the meantime PSR 5 is not

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,970
official we don't have it anyway Larry's

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,680
last bit of work was the caching

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,660
standard which is give us our six and

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,110
that was only finished a couple months

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:57,770
ago way too late for Drupal 8 and since

00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:00,280
then oh no and just before that PS r7

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:03,110
was adopted which is the HTTP messaging

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,420
interface and a couple of projects out

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,570
there are already adopting it and we can

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,940
use it through symphony and a rapper but

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,100
we don't have it in court and PS are

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,270
seven is actually amazing really

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,070
interesting and one of the interviews

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,280
that's going to be coming these with a

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:21,560
guy called post Simonson who is the

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,470
maintainer of sculpin and also the

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,620
editors for the maintainer the person

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:30,350
running the PSR 7 initiative I think he

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,480
just left coordinator I think he just

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,970
left that but he got that through and

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,870
basically it's a it's a message response

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,430
protocol that lets us put that through

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,140
any number of applications and get it

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,840
back in one piece in a standardized way

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,930
so it eats uh it's going to be a boon

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,700
for a modular application design and how

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,680
we build larger applications going for

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,420
it it's a really neat it's a paradigm

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,030
shift its cool so maybe Krell the crab

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:04,190
is our official representative to Pia

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:06,830
the PHP fit sorry took this for this I

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,010
don't want to speak to PHP from rupal I

00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:14,060
don't wanna speak to Drupal from PHP

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:16,520
that applies those are different things

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,730
that aren't part of each other or that

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,790
I'm part of one talking to the other and

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,180
that's not the point the point is that

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,990
Drupal n PHP

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,240
are not separate entities through police

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:34,230
part of the PHP world in the PT world is

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,720
part of Drupal and that collaboration

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:39,270
has helped us produce Drupal mates and

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,020
that collaboration can and should

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:46,050
continue to produce not just future

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:49,589
versions of Drupal but better practices

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:51,660
motor bus practices in PHP itself so I

00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:56,070
would encourage everyone from these two

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:58,080
large robust communities don't look at

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,470
them as two larger bus communities look

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,080
them as different pockets of one larger

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,860
community that we can all learn from

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,910
that we can all benefit from and

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:19,020
together we can build a better pH key

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:21,750
for all projects thank you there so what

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,180
Larry touched on when you start thinking

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,160
about yourself as a PHP developers a

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,420
part of a much larger global community

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,990
that includes a bunch of different

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,640
projects you start to realize that PHP

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,400
figure is about much more than just

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,449
standards which specific standards do we

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,509
adopt what PSR

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,919
what you know it's actually about a

00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:44,410
different architectural mindset

00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,910
different architectural choices when

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,419
you're building your projects when

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:51,639
you're building your own custom modules

00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:54,279
the two roles that I really try and keep

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,069
in mind myself first of all never

00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:00,309
reinvent the wheel we don't have to do

00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:04,569
that anymore and the second is make it

00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:07,269
easy to to use your work in other

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:09,939
projects outside of Drupal make your

00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:12,669
work as much as possible libraries that

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:14,380
can be exported and reused so a great

00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:17,829
example of this in the new paradigm is

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,459
the PHP libraries that commerce guys are

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,809
making for commerce too they're making

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,240
straight up PHP libraries and then a

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,010
Drupal implementation but any other PHP

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,500
project can go and write their

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:34,570
implementation for that as well manihot

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,110
rusik is the symphony framework

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,850
representative this PHP fake we had a

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,580
knock-down drag-out fantastic

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,649
conversation with him and kind of forgot

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:48,370
to get him to do a proper sound bite um

00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:49,630
but he's a he's a big name and symphony

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,980
really been interesting guy lives in

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,279
Austria and we're going to be talking

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,809
about his project Puli as well so this

00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:01,330
is been hot it's only a couple seconds

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,850
so how Drupal community I'm not artistic

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:08,080
or wet motored on Twitter welcome to

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:09,730
today sorry so that's when Mozart but

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,289
let's talk about let's talk about the

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,409
work that he's doing the rickety to

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,200
filter right well so Symphony is a

00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:19,820
really good

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,669
of death of how we're implementing those

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,059
two rules that i mentioned drupal 8

00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:27,889
threw out a lot of reinvented wheels and

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,320
for good reason right while we were on

00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:32,960
the island we did our own we had used or

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,029
we made everything our own way our own

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,250
unique snowflakes and we weren't going

00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:40,149
to touch how anybody else did it so my

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,260
first favorite example of that

00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:46,190
everybody's favorite function to hate on

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,720
Drupal HTTP request right can I get a

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:52,639
show of hands who has ever been

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:55,850
frustrated by this function how many of

00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:57,889
you people are not coders because i

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,710
don't know but i've ever met a drupal it

00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:04,760
hasn't been frustrated but not much yeah

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:08,179
and it's a well so this is the artist's

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:15,429
rendition of drupal HTTP request we

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:20,120
built it back at 4.6 2004 for I think

00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:23,840
5.5 thank you at the height of proudly

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,029
invented here mania so drupal HD not

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:32,510
even think to to elsewhere not invented

00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:39,519
elsewhere it's 304 lines in one function

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:39,519
and it recursos so enjoy debugging us

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:47,039
for testing we talked about keeping

00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,899
functions simple nowadays in

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,879
contemporary code practices there are

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,950
actually ways to quantify how

00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:55,590
complicated your function for your class

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,169
is and one of the really common ones is

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,479
called n path complexity and in short

00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:03,359
it's a measure of how many unique ways

00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:05,849
there are to run your function and how

00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,679
many unique outputs it has so it

00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:09,090
actually can grow exponentially so you

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,609
want to keep this number as low as

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,889
possible the guideline that I was taught

00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:16,409
is that if your n path complexity is

00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:20,279
over 200 it's too complicated and it's

00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:22,499
going to be awful to maintain does

00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,289
anybody want to guess what the end path

00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:28,200
not not you guys who know this off the

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:30,389
top of your day does anybody want to

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,979
guess what the end path complexity is

00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:39,509
for Drupal HTTP requests I'm gonna start

00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:44,820
picking people pick a number hire 1,000

00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:46,710
he said 1,000 do i hear two thousand for

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,139
you bet four thousand in the back way

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,179
higher you guys are nowhere near 10,000

00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:54,749
to good start you need more zeros who

00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,089
keep going who wants to offer more 11

00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:58,259
lakh 1 lakh that's a big number I don't

00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,649
remember how to translate that into

00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:03,839
Western number it's a hundred thousand

00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:08,909
one like way more who gives me 10 lakhs

00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:10,559
uh what was that one minute good try sir

00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:14,700
good tries your video from Xena are

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:21,049
still we need more zeros so tell me in

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:21,049
Indian numbers how many is 25 billion

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:32,470
right how many Krolak is that 250 crore

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:35,440
okay that's the Empire complexity of

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:39,610
this beautiful thing so if you want

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,640
right so if you want to test this to

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,550
completion and every test of yours takes

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,610
half a second to run it will take 400

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:54,310
years to do on your test that's why it

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:57,190
took so long to get your plane oh so we

00:21:54,310 --> 00:22:03,070
replace this old ridiculously complex in

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:05,050
an RC wheel with guzzle this is like the

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,480
slickest motorcycle picture I can find

00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,050
and it's an awesome yeah so guzzle is

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,150
the super slick super futuristic

00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:16,360
motorcycle of HTTP request libraries

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,860
actually the HTTP standard is quite a

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,040
complicated one there's lots of people

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,660
that attacked the space guzzle is the

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,000
one we chose because it has a lot of

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,950
features in particular but what we

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,500
really care about its environment

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,060
agnostic means it doesn't matter if you

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,580
have curl it doesn't matter if you've

00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,050
got PHP streams available or whatever is

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,730
going on in your environment you are

00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,410
running on the moon in Windows 95

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,460
environment I bet that puzzle can

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:45,190
actually operate it handles synchronous

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,840
and asynchronous requests which actually

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,370
I still have never wrapped my mind

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,860
around

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:51,540
a sickness T in PHP properly it's a bit

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,170
of a mind blower for me but guzzle does

00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,700
this out of the box it will handle for

00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,830
me the headache with people HTTP

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,960
requests was very often it was very

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,700
often working with cookies it works with

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,380
cookies totally transparently and you

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,390
can have shared cookies across the whole

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,470
site where you can have specific cookies

00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:14,100
for the one request and it is so easy my

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,210
yeah so easy my mother could do it and

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,240
to thank you she would be offended

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:23,190
better she considered her a power user

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,290
of her windows tablet but actually I

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,580
think the coolest power feature and I

00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,340
know it's not the only one but this is

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,260
the one I get the most excited about who

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,730
here has ever implemented an API

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:39,480
integration like a rest api integration

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:42,000
yeah almost all of us right so to do a

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,030
rest api integration with guzzle you

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,830
describe the api in a JSON file this is

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,690
that this is the end point if you're

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,010
using this path here the pure the

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,000
properties that you can assign

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:57,480
this looks back back in a JSON file and

00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,360
guzzle creates a class for you it does

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,090
the API integration for you that's like

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,680
days of work off your shoulders how many

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,040
lines of code does that save me for

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:12,240
every integration like 300 right written

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:14,610
for many more than I took codes and of

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,400
course we get it for free because open

00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,050
source is awesome like that so actually

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,090
because I'm excited about this this is

00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,300
this is an example of the JSON that you

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:27,000
use to describe your API integration if

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,120
you can write this and say okay get

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,340
polyps is a HTTP GET and this is the URI

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,990
and this is the response classic we

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,290
should get if you can write that you can

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,060
do an API integration I can't believe it

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,560
and get a hand for that I'm so still we

00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:44,760
just gotta have the rack thank you

00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:48,900
guzzle thank you guzzle so the other one

00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,850
that I like is PHP template who here has

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,270
been frustrated by PHP template in the

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,280
past Drupal sleeping system here we have

00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:01,170
a lot of steamers here so we wrote this

00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,900
in 2004 adrian russo know how supposed

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:05,850
to be priced at the time the whole

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,800
concept of a templating engine was

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,240
relatively new there were a bunch of

00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,790
people taking stabs at it in different

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,650
projects it was not unusual the tribbles

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,940
side could do it we decided to do it on

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:19,110
our own and it compared really favorably

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,320
to some of the other things that we

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,870
think we saw come up in that time in

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,900
some ways PHP template is too simple

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:30,630
right you can put any PHP you like into

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,580
a template file no problem right has

00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:37,020
anybody else here ever seen direct

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:40,179
sequel queries in a template file so the

00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,759
best the dash camera needs to catch

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:46,059
hands you're the best template file that

00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:49,570
i ever saw was twenty eight thousand

00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:54,639
lines of code it contained the entire

00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:57,429
site logic in the template for the front

00:25:54,639 --> 00:26:02,019
page of the site and the client was

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:05,019
wondering why the front page took 36 on

00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:11,590
a good day I think a little part of me

00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:13,269
just died right it's too simple template

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,789
files often have a lot of redundancy a

00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:18,279
lot ever done in HTML if you have 3d

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,350
content types that differ money in a

00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,539
minor way you have three template files

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:26,169
that are ninety-nine percent identical

00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,940
that's nuts and it's actually really

00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,519
hard to then document what are the

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,230
actual differences that we care about in

00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,600
other ways PHP template is too

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,029
complicated right we split the process

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,509
of creating HTML between files and

00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:42,490
modules and files in the theme I am

00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:44,470
definitely spent long periods of time

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,480
trying to figure out where the Hope

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,700
theme implementation is coming from

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,879
where this particular HTML is getting

00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,220
built we also tried to create a dome an

00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:57,490
HTML Dom that would work for every use

00:26:54,220 --> 00:27:00,879
case Dong's for all our dibs for all the

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:05,259
people of my kindle kingdom and every

00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:06,989
class that you could imagine yeah it's

00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:10,809
part of why i'm not a paper

00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:12,759
pretty Gorillaz and even the fact that

00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:15,429
PHP template required understanding of

00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,840
PHP turned out to be problematic at the

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,669
time we thought oh this is good you have

00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,369
to use know PHP to use Drupal well

00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:25,239
Tremonti murmurs don't they use more

00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:28,480
specialized language so we've replaced

00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:31,509
it with twig famously enough so twig is

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,820
a much simpler templating engine to use

00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:36,879
and it can handle a lot more complexity

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:40,269
at same time and it's externally

00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:41,830
developed and maintained so template

00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:43,749
files can extend each other this is my

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,759
personal favorite thing if you have

00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:47,889
three content types of different liner

00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,779
in a minor way you have one base

00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:51,940
template that applies to all of your

00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:54,100
content types and then you have three

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,779
other little templates that say extends

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,549
base and this is the only difference

00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:59,259
that you need to care about fewer lines

00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,929
of code to maintain a lot easier to

00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:04,450
figure out what's going on all of the

00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:07,720
logic involved in rendering HTML can now

00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:09,700
be contained anything that doesn't mean

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,679
that we allow you to run absolutely any

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,600
code in the template quite quite the

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,460
opposite it's a modern templating

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,840
language so you can do things like like

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,119
four loops you can do things like

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,129
conditionals but you sure can't query

00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,789
the database and cannot run arbitrary

00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:28,299
PHP so you can outsource your theming

00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:30,129
now very very easily and openly without

00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,779
really worrying about your themer of

00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:33,460
white screening your whole site

00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,590
compromising your server it's a very

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,809
very secure implementation as long as

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,570
you leave the database access level

00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,190
right unfortunately it lets you do like

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,270
you know the bad judgment module we

00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:47,760
should make sure that there's

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:49,680
yeah Adams favorite our colleague Adam

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,050
was there in Reno with us who is a theme

00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,290
or his favorite part is it always used

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,120
to be so crazy trying to figure out in

00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,330
PHP template I have a variable P set up

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,680
is it a string is the object this is an

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,640
array who knows we're going to guess and

00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,540
we're going to wipe screen the site

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,930
while we do it right in a twig you can

00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,300
actually traverse arrays and objects and

00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:13,620
strings without destroying it works so

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,090
another interview that we did along the

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,780
way was with a guy called Geordi bajando

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:21,150
Hugh is who's incredibly compelling

00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,260
hilarious public speaker if you ever get

00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,310
the chance to see him do a presentation

00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:28,710
do that very soft-spoken Belgian guy who

00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,080
is essentially well in my view with

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,990
because he's the maintainer of composure

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,730
um you know he's fifty percent of the

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,050
reason why were even able to have

00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,470
jubilate and this whole interoperability

00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:45,540
era composers a huge big deal he's also

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:47,640
the coordinator of the PSR three logging

00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,650
standard any happens to run the most

00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,690
popular PHP login solution which is

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,840
called monologue there is a Drupal 8

00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,640
integrate integration of that now

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,530
created by my friends in Italy well net

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,540
worth checking out if you want more

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,310
detail more interesting more useful logs

00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:06,180
than what people give is giving a box

00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:11,880
right now so we spoke with Jordan okay

00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:22,740
um all right let's do the present the

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:25,530
presidential address like okay so hi I'm

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,200
Julie Pacino I maintain composure

00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:32,430
monologue and the few other libraries he

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:36,600
might end up using I want to welcome you

00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:38,550
into the border PHP community and hope

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,070
that you will eventually like use some

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:43,100
of my projects and don't you get back to

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,100
that

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:53,310
right so so who here is used composure

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,750
before okay so we don't really need to

00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:58,590
explain what composer is I'm just going

00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:00,960
to skip right over that I had no problem

00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,660
with this section of the presentation I

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,150
was supposed to demonstrate for you

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:09,240
integrating external library students

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:11,070
closer and the problem that I have is

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,710
that it's actually too easy to be worth

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:16,260
a demo and I found that the parts that I

00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:19,080
would be demonstrating we're just Drupal

00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:22,020
API actually you know where do you look

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,010
this particular behavior in so instead

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,840
we're just going to do it through a

00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:29,520
series of slides years process step 1

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,970
download and install composer manager

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,410
there are well composer needs a single

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,180
list of all the libraries in use in

00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,970
project or packages using your project

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,460
not just the ones your module uses not

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,770
just the one other modules use and but

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,740
also the ones that core use of all has

00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:49,230
or uses all have to be compiled into one

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,110
big list there are a very good ways to

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,820
manage this by hand but if you are all

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,290
interested in this slide it means you

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,850
should probably be used this module

00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,790
compose a manager makes it

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:02,070
easier installation instructions are

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,910
easy enable the module as usual and run

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:07,740
one shell command you're done step 2

00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:10,860
look for the functionality you want at

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,270
packages org there's a that's the

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,880
repository for every project the

00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,800
composer knows about looking for which

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,690
package you want to use feels a lot to

00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,760
me like looking for the people module

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,630
that I want to use and four five six

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,370
seven luckily they tell you right here

00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:30,150
up front how many stars it has how many

00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:31,950
how many downloads it has again it's how

00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:35,130
popular the project is that helps you

00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:38,730
figure out how supporting to this step

00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,650
three type composer require into your

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,630
terminal you do it in your model

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,690
directory so it creates a composer to

00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:48,030
json file in your module and it updates

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,490
the list of required libraries for your

00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:52,890
module automatically one thing that I

00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,870
keep forgetting this you do minus minus

00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,640
no of update otherwise it will actually

00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,280
download the library into your module

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,950
and you open it back into that globally

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:05,940
step four is tell composer to update

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,380
your installed libraries and that's it

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,670
end of demonstration just go ahead and

00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,620
use the library doesn't matter how

00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:13,470
complicated it is it's all there for you

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:17,010
one of my favorite demos that I tried to

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,990
make was actually the AWS package that

00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,300
lets you do everything with amazon web

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:25,290
services from spinning up instances to a

00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:28,610
stream wrapper for s3 I threw together a

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:30,970
SZ 3d file system module for Drupal 8

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,950
didn't get finished testing it's not

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,870
contributing but the ease with which I

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,490
got to the complicated part how do I

00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:39,210
actually connect to s3 how do I actually

00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:42,280
create a stream wrapper that makes sense

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,960
it was amazing right and all of packages

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,120
functionality is now available to you in

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,429
your site too so when you go with

00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,530
composer you stop spending time writing

00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:54,400
functionality you only have to write the

00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:56,380
Drupal integration steps for the real

00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,179
mind-blower of course Drupal itself

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,760
jubilate itself can be installed with

00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:03,360
composer so can all of your Drupal

00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,730
modules we have our own Drupal packages

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,510
so a lot of people recommend that you

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,760
don't commit core or controls you

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,639
actually just commit your composure dog

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,159
JSON and have your continuous deployment

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,070
or continuous integration service put it

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:26,020
all together for you at runtime for

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:30,429
deployment time mother so fully has

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:33,330
anybody here used podia okay oh so this

00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,649
is very much reception new project right

00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:38,040
bully is pretty is pretty hot stuff I

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:41,379
think it's a sort of composure to last

00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,419
tool it's getting really popular as

00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,940
jubileus were all familiar with the

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:47,800
dilemma of code versus configuration

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,950
that there are certain things that are

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,629
at the very least in a gray area for how

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,409
you should get them into your repository

00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:58,220
how do you actually store the move

00:34:54,409 --> 00:35:00,049
environments hooli makes that a bit of a

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,780
bigger problem to solve and is

00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:05,839
interested in not just configuration

00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:09,220
like yellow files but also anything

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,720
that's not non-code images CSS files

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,599
what have your translation files is one

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,369
of the big examples the deal is if I

00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,680
maintain a package there are probably

00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:21,950
some non code elements with it that I

00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,230
want to include if you get Jen wants to

00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,510
use it in Drupal duple is going to want

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,950
those non code elements in probably a

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,410
different directory probably different

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:33,020
location in whatever unique environment

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:37,240
jam is set up if somebody else wants to

00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:39,530
use it in not work workers give another

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,359
thank you somebody else wants use it in

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,980
thin their whole architecture is

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,109
different again what they want to do

00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,630
with those non-code assets is thicker

00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:50,780
bully is a way that a package maintainer

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,730
can write a map for those files so that

00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,799
when you want to use them in Drupal you

00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,020
can map those to the right locations and

00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:58,490
the code in the package can figure out

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,569
where it should be putting those non

00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:05,869
code elements and in June Baron what is

00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:09,349
doing a full pulley demonstration on my

00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:11,559
podcast yeah heads up so keep an eye

00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:14,380
open I I expect we're going to see

00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,869
fully used more and more in Drupal

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,910
because it makes it easier to get to get

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,279
that and use some of those packages

00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,709
products so Beth Tucker long has been

00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:25,140
doing PHP for a long long time she used

00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:27,849
to work for the page the Arctic

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,739
architect magazine she's incredibly

00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:32,559
smart incredibly capable and as a

00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:35,380
consultant she ends up working on a lot

00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,029
of legacy projects and the podcast with

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,319
her that we're going through these super

00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:40,209
super interesting because she gets this

00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:42,039
whole other perspective that I wasn't

00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:44,049
even cognizant of when we were thinking

00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,059
about hey build this cool new thing and

00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:47,529
Pune Google aid and cutting edge and

00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:49,630
we're all right on time she's like I

00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:51,099
inherit all this old stuff and it's

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,479
really hard and I have to deal with all

00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:54,670
the ways that we figured out are now

00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:57,130
wrong and I really really like her

00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,170
perspective on how the PSRs will help

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,579
her job get easier over time but as

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:03,759
things get standardized it's really

00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:06,099
worth checking out hello Jubal my name

00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:08,920
is Beth Tucker lon and I am so excited

00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:11,229
that people eight is out way to go we're

00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,329
very proud of you and I am really

00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:16,689
excited about triple eight because it

00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:20,109
represents so much community involvement

00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:23,410
working together I'm so excited that we

00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:24,819
have so many big projects from the PHP

00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,799
side of things and the Drupal side of

00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:28,959
things working together and I just can't

00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:30,369
wait to see with all this brain power

00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:37,920
that we have merged into this project

00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:37,920
where we go from here okay so listen um

00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,120
I think one of the reasons that I think

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,550
that is interesting is because I think

00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,920
she is an example of what most

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,990
freelancers and most of us who are

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,310
faithfully developers have to deal with

00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,350
you actually have to jump between

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,940
frameworks all the time and somebody

00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,730
comes to you and says oh you know Drupal

00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,470
sure I can figure it out no problem do

00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,730
you know joomla yeah okay I can work

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,230
that out we wrote this other thing in

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,000
full stack can you integrate it please

00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:07,330
mm-hmm you have to be able to jump

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,640
between frameworks really easily what

00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:12,550
Beth talks about is that the HP fake

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,530
makes it easy to do that you understand

00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,210
and you know a lot of the tools already

00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,890
and even if you don't know the specific

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,720
tool you know the interface that it

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,910
implements you know the basic rules of

00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,010
how to work with it so for example if

00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,220
you can theme for drupal 8 you learn

00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,590
twig scope and uses twig it's a site

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,990
generator like like Jenkins it just

00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:35,470
happens to use twig as a templating

00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:36,970
engine and even just jump right in there

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,770
are lots of other applications to

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,480
reveals on symfony2 way too many

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:44,260
dimension is that the next slide well so

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,770
let's give it so to get an idea of look

00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,870
if you're a great drupal 7 developer for

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:52,780
one awesome and you're super employable

00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:55,210
for another decade at least but your

00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,940
skills are really really specialized and

00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:01,630
a bit hard to transfer to do another

00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:03,730
work as a great Drupal 8 developer

00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,900
knowing guzzle knowing the symphony

00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,460
components that we've got your knowing

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,000
the object oriented architecture to

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:12,010
spend dependency injection and so on

00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,050
actually you're incredibly enabled to

00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,380
work not just in Drupal please stay with

00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,850
us but to do a lot of other things too

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,010
how about a lot of our places and to be

00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,620
very very quickly on boarded up to speed

00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:27,190
with whatever gets thrown at you so here

00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:29,890
are just the projects that Symphony list

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,410
says the major projects using Symphony

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,330
framework components Drupal page between

00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,150
laravel symphony full stack ez publish

00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,369
community silex joomla composer

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:42,720
and so Abby hat is really really

00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:44,730
interesting some doctoring really really

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,529
really interesting this um but that's

00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,619
not the full list of the projects using

00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:51,510
the symphony framework components this

00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,980
is enough to start several of your own

00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,980
companies and like have a great life

00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,900
this is cool and you know plus minus how

00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,380
these work once you're comfortable with

00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,760
the blame um plus most of those with a

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,410
web front and are going to be using

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,480
Twitter as their templating engine since

00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,849
it's also maintained by sensing labs who

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,099
maintain symphony so you know you're

00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:15,569
really really in a great place and HB

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,210
even another one in my favorite things

00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:20,930
yeah it rounded but who cares use

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:24,329
phpunit let's get a round of applause

00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:27,660
only if you've used phpunit clap for me

00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:32,819
just give me a little bit right s

00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:35,340
phpunit save you time yes I like the

00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:37,690
applause which is nice

00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:41,650
we had a wonderful conversation with

00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:43,990
Sebastian Berman who is the HP unit this

00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:46,690
is the testing structure testing system

00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:49,510
that is used by a lot of PHP projects

00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:53,940
now in the linen especially Drupal 8

00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:58,810
which to jump right to this video game

00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:01,150
ok so hi I'm Sebastian Batman I about 15

00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,310
years ago I created fish internet to

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:08,230
help PHP developers build better

00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:10,600
software I'm happy that or I would like

00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,630
to congratulate community on the reason

00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:19,420
to play and as far as I know phpunit

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:24,760
played some role in it thank you very

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:26,920
much so so testing economically is a

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,440
huge money saver and as a developer it

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,240
um we can test before we commit to our

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,560
main release and you know we do our

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,210
colleagues a favor we do ourselves a

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,390
favor it's a time saver it's a work

00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:39,490
saver make sure you you and your company

00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:44,920
are doing testing as part of you know

00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:47,020
your workflows it's fantastic and oh and

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,330
what's your familiar with phpunit well

00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,490
it works in Drupal 8 it works in in most

00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,530
every ide that you'll be using it's

00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:54,930
useful for anything that's written in

00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:59,619
PHP so it's an incredibly useful

00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:01,780
transferable skill again now so here we

00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:04,750
are welcome to Drupal 8 welcome to the

00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,369
new world of PHP I want to call out a

00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,170
fun little thing that's been going on

00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:09,630
this this this interoperability movement

00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:12,850
this idea that Drupal 8 was coming

00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:15,040
prompted a friend of ours to put out

00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,320
some put on a challenge a few years ago

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,900
who ever read that blog post getting off

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:25,750
the island in 2013 oh yeah getting off

00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,200
the island in 2013 this guy had this

00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:31,359
crazy idea that because Drupal was in

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,920
the future going to be more relevant to

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,320
other parts of PHP

00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:40,740
we should like go to user group meeting

00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,740
or a convention on another project

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,559
without rain one of them without making

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,420
like respectfully not to throw them so

00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,660
Larry Garfield wrote this post and it

00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,660
made huge waves across the PHP community

00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:58,809
was picked up of course in Drupal lot um

00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:00,430
so you can read that post it's still

00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,980
great is some excellent so his first

00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,450
choice was get off your Island go see

00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,470
what other people are doing there's all

00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:10,420
kinds of amazing stuff going on um in

00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:12,579
2015 I believe early in 2015 he made a

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,349
second challenge which was build a

00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:18,940
bridge um and that was um wait a minute

00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:24,430
I'm blanking on what the challenge was

00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:27,099
you it isn't there build something big

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,349
oh sorry Steve all Wow okay it's a

00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:32,829
little hot now so the second challenge

00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:34,900
was build something with another project

00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:36,369
you know don't do the drupal go do it

00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,609
with sculpt and go do it with with

00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:41,619
sympathy for faculty so and um when we

00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:43,630

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:11,140
our session rated here if you didn't

00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,710
like our session find another one to

00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:16,330
rate

00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:16,330
thank you very much very much

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:33,170
did we forget something question yes

00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:45,510
what is the interoperability situation

00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,510
in other languages besides PHP

00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,830
it with beautiful cooperating or other

00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:06,540
languages doing the same kind of stuff

00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:08,470
that PHP is doing I don't think so

00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,060
there's talk of doing more with

00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:12,490
JavaScript but the JavaScript community

00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:14,920
is extraordinarily fragmented and I have

00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:16,119
no idea but what's going on there beyond

00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,980
that there are the languages of doing

00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,090
cool stuff but since Drupal doesn't use

00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,940
those languages we're not really paying

00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:24,430
much attention there 10 dancers just

00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:28,000
know the closest thing that I would say

00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:29,500
to that happening is moving is all of us

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,270
moving towards standards as as a

00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,890
language so for example with JavaScript

00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,390
interoperability the biggest thing that

00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,119
we could have done is make sure that

00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:43,119
everything is restful we work very hard

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:46,000
to make to make Drupal completely lost

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,160
thank you restful love you but we've

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,810
worked very hard to make it easy to use

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,240
a front end frame where our JavaScript

00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,740
on them and we're on top of Drupal but

00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,320
yeah as far as I know there's not a

00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,150
formal movement to make that happen yeah

00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,490
I wanted to get in the same line of

00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:03,280
interoperability so you can connect

00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:06,089
Drupal to a lot of things like there's a

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,980
lot of efforts going into both rest and

00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:10,359
relax web services and graphic you out

00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,220
and those kind of things where you can

00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:14,710
make triple appear like it's a couch TV

00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,930
database or make people appear like it's

00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:19,900
exposing all this data structure similar

00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:21,369
to have a Facebook dust so you so in

00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,619
terms of into our probability there's a

00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,180
lot of efforts going on with Drupal and

00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:25,740
you can connect it to whatever other

00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,160
type

00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,160
key ones

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:46,119
any plan to change database I know ask

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,549
you I'm sorry any plans for changing the

00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:51,339
database open my answer database because

00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:53,140
you think of scalar will you be yeah to

00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:55,869
use things like animosity well so

00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:58,539
actually with Drupal 7 we introduced a

00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:01,269
reasonably robust database abstraction

00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:04,900
layer so technically you can put any

00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:06,670
data source behind it there are some

00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,989
logistical complexities when you do

00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,329
something that has actually

00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:12,789
fundamentally different assumptions like

00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:14,829
like no SQL so the newest field

00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:17,799
implementations for Drupal 7 tend to be

00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:19,599
only for specific areas of it so for

00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:21,670
example the entity API you can do think

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,589
with but big chunks of core you can't

00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,960
use only the my sequel database in

00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:28,180
Drupal 8 that's supposed to be a lot

00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:33,940
easier and now I'm gonna ask Larry to

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:36,460
tell me that I'm right good the database

00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,619
abstraction layer in seven and eight is

00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,279
for just SQL databases please don't try

00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:44,529
to put a non SQL database behind it that

00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:46,630
said in triple 8 you should never be

00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:48,789
writing your own SQL anyway you should

00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,529
be using end of API using the config

00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:52,509
system you should be using the key value

00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:55,799
store and all of those could be swapped

00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:59,440
out for other backgrounds I know that

00:49:55,799 --> 00:50:03,130
checks has demoed Drupal 8 running with

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,559
purely MongoDB already so it can be done

00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,969
and you can do it piecemeal depending on

00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:08,200
what part of the system you're talking

00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:10,930
about and what part is going to make

00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,969
sense for that's it don't discount SQL

00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,650
it's actually a lot more powerful people

00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:17,249
getting credit for and a lot faster you

00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,249
can get it credit for

00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:26,339
other questions like that we've had this

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,599
this third speaking partner here all

00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:29,609
right well thank you guys very much for

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,890
coming I hope you have a great fun thank

00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:34,069
you for hosting this year and we'll see

00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,069
