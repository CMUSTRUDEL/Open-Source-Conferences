	00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:58,150
just foster family

00:00:52,950 --> 00:01:03,309
and yeah today today is to Bates

00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:05,229
contributed not audience so hands up who

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:10,030
has already started working on a couple

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:12,940
a project sites with multi-country a

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,360
multi-domain functionalities we have

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,130
started doing so we try to live in our

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,509
use case as to what we have tested so

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:24,790
far but I take an example year building

00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:28,509
with on a with empathy be something that

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:32,170
we that we will try in general I think

00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,670
away every agency every developer has

00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,440
their own personal taste of how you

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:40,720
wanna approach all the music modules and

00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,880
some saying that you should not use any

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,890
after release for example or I should

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,610
not use a deaf release intersect at the

00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:53,380
recent prada that for example if you

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:58,030
rely on secure on the security team but

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,649
in general we think that just because it

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,440
has a name because it's a lock release

00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:04,390
because it's a better release those are

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,740
depends a lot on how much trust we have

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,119
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:13,460
what we can have a final release and

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:17,450
it's totally broken so being part of the

00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,660
community having extend time work

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,130
working on several projects I think

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,260
every one of us will get our own

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:32,870
understanding of how stable something is

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:34,880
how much we can trust were close yeah so

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,010
for example in your registration line

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,860
it's like a simple workflow that's

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:44,660
already there on the workbench

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:48,650
moderation eat you just had an offer

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:52,280
released recently I couldn't try it's

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,510
kind of nice um entity registration is

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,410
not there but there's like an

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,150
alternative to eat RMG I found it quite

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,120
interesting i played around the videos

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,540
it's like mary has a lot of

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,170
functionality and then besides that

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,260
workflow module has its first after

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,750
release from organic groups is already

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,870
being ported and we are working actively

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:24,019
reporting the rules for you so we expect

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:27,799
the first MVP in the next month and yeah

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:29,239
explain with us in Sunday basically use

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,390
what you're already provides a lot of

00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,370
functionality so it's kind of

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,060
interesting other modules can already

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,750
start porting their integration but

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,750
there's no way

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:53,310
at least all right yeah so we got in

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,500
look at those and for Billy let's talk a

00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:01,080
bit about how we approach names well

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:05,070
trooper core itself obviously provides

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:09,050
many of you I custom links um and then

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:14,010
for example the cyclic volume or we were

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:18,170
also better to me when we talk about

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:22,340
porns the back for module it's kind of

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:27,510
not ported modular moment and

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:31,440
interestingly form or entity for st

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:34,050
started 40 but we currently rely on is

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,990
the contact module so it's part of a

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,020
quorum you can create different force

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,000
based on the counter point just by

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,760
itself it doesn't store everything so

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,500
the context storage module allows you to

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:53,790
dance store data and yeah for example

00:04:49,500 --> 00:05:00,350
with the CSV stabilizer you can also

00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:02,700
export the consort into water systems I

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,600
think you have the main difference here

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,730
is that like how scalable solution like

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,850
if you want your clients to be able to

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,990
create their own formula then that's

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,990
definitely a use case

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,820
because of the contact of the eform they

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:26,700
rely on fields being creative for every

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:32,190
of the of the cornfields and that can be

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,190
getting slow quick thousands of fields

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:43,930
SEO so well Cooper call by itself

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,210
obviously supports calm and then the

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,640
minute i call you has made quite some

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,180
steps in development i found an

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,330
interesting that that you would use meta

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,570
technology field so you like you attach

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,110
to get to know types and there you can

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,960
specify the default but now with the

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,780
latest release on there's also a classic

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,720
metal tag approach where you can define

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:15,310
like flu defaults and overwrite them for

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:20,560
no types or father for its on mr.

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:25,120
exactly then auto is already pre pretty

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,750
solid the redirect volume is one yes we

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,960
also use the Google Analytics volume and

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:35,650
then XML sitemap that didn't work out

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,180
because it's not like the standard XML

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,330
sitemap module doesn't support

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,400
multilingual tomorrow we start working

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,370
on a patch

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,380
you get very far but we found an

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,900
alternative since April XML sitemap

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:54,539
Moyer also works with multilingual and

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:58,289
it reads up um yeah but also the 53

00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,669
pounds and pathologic Morgans are kind

00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:07,500
of initiate that you can already play

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:09,240
around and display there so tomorrow i

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,210
will do a session together with a mature

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,820
about our Cody versus clicking where we

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,240
compare approaches of implementing

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:22,430
layouts in code or weeks I cleaning

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:27,060
tools and some of them are nation here

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:31,250
so the blocks and layouts initiative has

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,860
made like very good progress in terms of

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,110
enabling blocks to be much more than

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,699
they were shattered so approximately 47

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,180
was basically something that nobody

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:46,440
liked though and now it's a basement

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,150
plugins um okay I said you can put you

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,460
can define different block ties you can

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,770
put fields on them so it's kind of

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,590
interesting also in terms of how do i

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,500
structure my content because basically

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:04,050
you can create reusable pieces of

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:06,120
content based on blocks but then when

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,580
you want to lay up so there's like

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,169
something like you can split up into

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,990
different parts when the panel small

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:16,830
your most importantly first started to

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,630
extract expansion and together the

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,240
layout blogging you could already create

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,460
like

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,880
pages that have different visions and

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,310
place any kind of talking to you it's

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,889
kind of great and also the district

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,690
display sweet module has imported really

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:37,240
early so they had a release like over a

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:39,250
year ago okay and yeah it's kind of a

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,370
matter of taste but I think you can use

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,450
any of these and Emmas antagonizer have

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,610
had releases in the last month as well

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:53,370
so they also got to a point where people

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:57,670
can already fly them I personally except

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,440
we asparagus pasta to type and layout

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,500
blog in a cage structure that's what he

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,440
have used successfully already on

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:09,880
projects I think that panels now is also

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:14,010
initiated I will try and that just just

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:18,550
haven't had any footage a sweet so far

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,430
then listings well that's crazy no

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,970
computer the markets require their use

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,920
the new to our apartment report on their

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:32,170
done small an extension motors for them

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:35,130
available more artistic research so the

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:41,040
Cooper for search is at least appear I

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:45,630
think we should do a search for search

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,630
the big anything about

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,410
the exciting thing is that the partial

00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:57,950
solar module and search api module the

00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,050
job forces sofa to play there will be no

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:06,650
more confusion between two competing

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:09,370
modules and yeah so GPRA even with the

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,980
solar search they all have had reeses

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,290
like multiple releases or email ok

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,540
anymore more functionality there I'm

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:21,380
also fasten so it's nominate from casa

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:25,460
de TI capacités they are really really

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,530
active initiative the facets we already

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,710
started using it on the project we

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,900
haven't released you but so far like

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,270
it's much more limited because you don't

00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:39,140
have all the different facet for

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,370
example but in general um I think it's

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,400
definitely something that I would

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,760
already and if I'm not familiar with it

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,980
I would already installed and try out as

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,790
mentioned that the philly pops model is

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:57,950
important but i'm looking into finding

00:10:52,790 --> 00:11:02,030
somebody take over the kitchen free or

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:04,550
normally I was um maybe it doesn't it

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,760
doesn't even have to exist because if we

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,720
get the best smoky right the overhead

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,480
pretty fast for you

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:17,990
used even more then we can just many

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:22,680
added as an extension they're right back

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:24,629
I did my master thesis on creating

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,589
interactive class with people which was

00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:32,069
kind of fun so the Geo caster module is

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:36,870
about putting 100,000 or billions of

00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:39,600
points and scalable but right now i'm

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,060
going to talk more about like just the

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,769
static use case you want to have a nap

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,930
on the contact page for example and or

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:52,980
you want to visualize a list of data on

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,689
Anna and what we kind of thing is it's

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,310
also a good opportunity in general for

00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:58,860
all of the use cases where you don't

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:03,839
like the bottom here well maybe a

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:09,269
JavaScript library or you can in general

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:12,959
with the hype about super late getting

00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:14,879
off the iron maybe for for those use

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:20,160
cases where you don't mind yet love you

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:22,589
maybe it is like a symphony value so for

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,509
the maps we recommend well we don't need

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,819
almost global modules we just go

00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:31,230
JavaScript if possible and expose the

00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:35,759
data hej hej supports on the server side

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:40,949
um yeah the views you Jason the GOP

00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:44,360
modules are being like utterances solely

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:48,120
quite buggy at the moment is for a taxi

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,710
and then there's a ton of helper models

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,700
so for administrative first

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,380
purposes well Cooper corner has the

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,290
contextual links which which allow you

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:04,940
to to be able to edit things wherever

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,660
you are on the side you to school we

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,610
obviously stole a bit too laughs okay

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:15,710
like the admin menu that you can quickly

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:17,900
access may contact even go on mother

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,650
lift a responsive at the menu let the

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,390
boy core collapse it's also live with

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,900
from time to time about into the seventh

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,970
side on my phone and everywhere we

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,650
should install that I think it's

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:40,610
backward installing try to focus as much

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:43,780
as possible newbridge mascara also max

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:49,220
because you can switch between users um

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:51,830
then already works there's also a PT

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,690
important already admitting that was

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,690
kind of popular two samples for

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:04,880
then services so we also have cloudy and

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:10,070
always maintained at the rest no thank

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:13,160
you so the coke or by itself hello talks

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,250
about decoupling rupal record cell

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:20,380
provides the restful functionality which

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:23,750
is great how is like the civilization

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:27,560
and then I'm adding feats here so these

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:30,709
module is not ported before and like

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,720
somebody started saying that he sporting

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:36,020
it doesn't look at the moment that

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,360
there's much for words but I also want

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,180
to add a crab ql because they're high

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,630
it's going to be all so we are able to

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,620
just create to the data expose it as a

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:52,640
wrap so the graph URL is quite active

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:55,670
and so there's like a project behind

00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:01,010
that to make it happen so looking

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:05,959
forward to the reasons there yes then

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:08,180
performance to play by itself as as

00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:11,380
quite soundly perfect performance

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,870
improvements based on the cash register

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,470
and there's already a release for a

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,570
varnish one

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,140
and then we are looking forward to big

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,810
five being debated before and there's

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,780
like a first recent article if you like

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:33,450
that probably make sense again more

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:39,380
complicated country then configuration

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:46,620
action all part of a cork I think it's a

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:48,630
big relief for all of us I think for

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,820
Miami setting people I still figuring

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:56,910
out the perfect work clothes how he's

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:58,620
going to work out the done so what you

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,890
can do now our topic or is that

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,360
everything gets expert but if you want a

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,300
normal functionality if you want to

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,490
transfer energy to the other side what

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:15,360
you want them to use is the features one

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:18,560
and that for me didn't work out yeah as

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,860
anyone is anyone using features ability

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,860
would you believe

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,730
in the neck there is like a collection

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:32,280
of helper modules that try to facilitate

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,380
the configuration management like for

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:41,490
example automatically exporting whenever

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:47,160
somebody's activity okay I haven't seen

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:49,170
like d 1 module there and then what we

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,950
always use is the legacy is a small you

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:56,100
just to just ensure that the CSS

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,900
probably put into a shimmer and the

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,310
advanced segregation model also has a

00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:04,770
choice to leave if you want our to start

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,050
beaming put all the JavaScript into the

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:13,709
filter this that's what you want to be

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:17,940
there yes then what my grade c chord and

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:27,900
there the mic with you i was also be

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:30,780
soon they all videos evolving and then I

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:34,580
name is a more like colder token develop

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:38,250
see to escape to blow a hex honeypot

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:42,020
those hormones like catalogs that we

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,020
have already use or need to use

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:53,890
like I think there was like a big

00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:56,980
overview as we can see our next slide

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,289
there's some really good resources I

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,159
definitely would recommend the

00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:05,900
contractor so people have started

00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:08,809
creating issues for every of these

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,630
modules and you can see on account

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:13,940
balance tile board which of the modules

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,640
have already been started 40 which of

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,169
the modules have are redundant now

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,679
because they're covered with difficult

00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,990
functionality there's like 50 of them we

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,720
go

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:30,510
anymore so that's kind of the go to all

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:37,830
of you because this presentation will

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:40,170
probably tomorrow p updating it and then

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:44,100
there's also TN status from angie

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:52,350
systems what is show there is also a

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:57,230
test of failing our testings with that i

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,230
would like to show you a strategy so

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,750
basically the information that I talk

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:11,990
about right now is what I in quality

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:14,870
still expect that's also link from the

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:17,149
presentation so it's again it's my

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:21,649
personal assessment of what is relevant

00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:24,080
and how while Porter it is but it may be

00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:27,860
good I could lease to just came through

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,169
and this to decide for yourself what you

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:37,429
gotta do kind of try out things what you

00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:39,040
can already savvy customers are not all

00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:42,610
right

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,970
new questions so what would be the

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:48,150
reason for you to suggest the customers

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,150
you

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,240
Ronald or

00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,940
what our what's the reason

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,650
well the missing piece or pieces that

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,740
are

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,740
or

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,909
well the first it I think it depends on

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,620
multiple things like the customers

00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:17,830
access to have agency can provide

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,659
complete services there's more and more

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,700
agencies that can provide services that

00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:25,580
there is a lot of agencies that have no

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,440
I experience a tuple idiot so it's like

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,379
this chicken egg problem if you first

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:38,120
have to learn it and you can use it but

00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:39,649
um the big pieces that are missing like

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,850
if you really need that form and then

00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:46,519
either either you have to find a custom

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:52,090
solution to build your own web form over

00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:55,460
to actually portable imodium more like a

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:58,100
commodity question would you wanna

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,590
invest in something that is rock solid

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,720
that people have used for various

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,080
usually or do you wanna invest into

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,049
something that not thousands of people

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,519
have used already but it's going to be

00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:15,799
relevant for much much longer because I

00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:17,870
mean now everybody's picking out about

00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:24,139
the posix of being supported anymore and

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:26,090
the same will happen so we can make our

00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:28,399
customer sure the triple seven will be

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,350
supportive let's say three four five

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:35,110
years we don't know exactly

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:37,450
the kind of number and if they want to

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:42,580
kill something that is supported longer

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:47,010
I would always try to go we hate those

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,010
are happy that's the answer

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:59,680
hasten always convincing

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,950
mankind or for that so any posting that

00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,320
name

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,320
the body is elastic was

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,490
pretty ricky

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,059
is

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:25,090
I think actually believe this beautiful

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,950
in certain except in certain like to

00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,320
play doesn't requires many workarounds

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,700
as we have people send in for example

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,559
the cupola is already better than the

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:39,760
possibility circle sense and it's

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:42,010
already more extensible and salt lake is

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,900
this negotiation me that solutions that

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,120
have proven themselves in purple seven

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,700
are the effort to Tulane and much more

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:57,779
flexible like the kind of hatch kids to

00:22:48,700 --> 00:23:04,799
rob's work on pages which provides but

00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:04,799
since it away model was not and it was

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:13,720
I had do this for the patch so when we

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,720
create a

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,720
user

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,390
then

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,730
under on your side which I sure

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:42,019
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,019
so he's asking music oh my god

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,929
architecture is that inside

00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,610
these parties you can do for now

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:10,350
so I mean it and there can be multiple

00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,860
answers to that question because we

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,900
asking for the whole group or saturday

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,870
ecosystem when is it very fruitful even

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,640
my answer would be whenever you or

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,860
whatever quickest on some things will

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,350
just throw away and nobody would put the

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,420
middle but legs let's say the eighty

00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,220
percent use case that every one of us

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,480
likes to be able to set up to our

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,700
clients and I would say like in the next

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,780
half a year would be able to build a lot

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,730
of stuff away but if that covers your

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,450
particular industry is your particular

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:51,000
module there is officially there's

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:53,370
nobody able to tell you that everything

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,740
with reported at some point just doesn't

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:59,250
work in in all open source environment

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,650
but this like I know that for example

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:04,260
are clear so slow like trying to fund a

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,880
lot of contributed modules for example

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,820
they provide also fax for us for the

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,630
rules initiative and then allowed us to

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,430
now predict that the MVP will be reading

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,620
the next month so that's something

00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:21,410
really helpful and I think that's

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,410
something I don't know

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,320
also some

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,320
for most definitely

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:50,580
yes the perfect cause every one of us

00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:53,190
dedicates a bit of time to put 40 or

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,470
provides a bit of taunting to the longer

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,660
that we want to see it doesn't mean that

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:02,460
we have to fund all the volumes because

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:08,660
if we multiply our resources then

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,660
success is closed the fire destroyed

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,240
dangerous person

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,419
I have assigned into buses from us for

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,230
years

00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,230
def I

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,980
I was

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,220
oui madame

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:57,059
in so with super area with ditch

00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:00,360
upgrades like the update functionality

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,880
and will be not reverse migration right

00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,700
so we have just hit a dog that tries to

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,160
upgrade everything but we could likely

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,410
program or configure migration and

00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,990
purchase fetch the data or edge the

00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,630
configuration translated into a new side

00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,640
which in general is what everybody

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,919
founders that aspect is anyways because

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,950
after a couple of years what you have

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:26,010
guilt in over to full version is not the

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,169
way that you want it again like you you

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,450
still want to restructure things you

00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,910
wanna learn from the mistakes that you

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,350
want to give something fresh imbue you

00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,960
may be also want to just throw away

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:41,910
about to punch anybody needs any more

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:47,370
under so I think going from six to eight

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:52,250
is perfectly balanced choice and because

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,250
yeah it has a longer feature

00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:03,040
I have some of the important contents of

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,510
each module is not available to forget

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,509
is the vibrant motion only way to do

00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,169
important

00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:16,729
on them or website to make an initial

00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:19,719
content report yes I don't know

00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,719
important

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,750
great for both

00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:27,750
beta team

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:37,340
Mike and follow jessica is creating a

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,340
website

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,950
it

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,590
so I have a distribution called

00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:59,730
multilingual demo that has like 10 lines

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,860
of code to import a CSV to 10 degrees so

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,020
it's probably easier to use that letter

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,210
code instead of the migrated marshal

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,620
Bucca stay on oh like for the migraine

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,670
module you will need to somehow figure

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,620
out how to get that CSV method to

00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:18,570
entities and stuff is probably harder

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:20,550
than this ESP at doing it right so if

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:24,260
you want to look at its multiple orders

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:26,909
for demo project on google or work

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,190
is called trial were setting up

00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:37,840
Thanks with

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:40,179
that's located it was over the triple

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,159
console provides a collapse as well for

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:45,730
generating content if you were learning

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:48,460
what we content honestly like the heat

00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:51,539
water works out last important here but

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,539
such a small and /

00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:00,460
I guess it is pretty nice so it's super

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,460
easy to create content

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,340
no actually the migrated over to Duluth

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,170
understands the configuration that you

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:31,380
have the outside and will allow you to

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:33,360
two important configuration so it Debbie

00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,520
hands on how many cops with the pockets

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:41,310
you have and if they also provide their

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,590
own migration talks um yeah if you can

00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,060
if you can live with the core

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,910
functionality and then build around

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:51,810
again or our great customizations for

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:57,050
anything else we need it we need an

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:59,940
something how disciples KX it was but

00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:03,090
the nice thing about migrations is that

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,340
you can just rerun so we first start

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,870
migrating and you got to live around

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,870
them and you can be rather migration

00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:17,510
ready to see question

00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,380
if I add a little excitement than what

00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,500
the devil

00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:24,050
and if the other thing that we should go

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,030
to add you to the lane and this entire

00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:28,940
situation or few hundred more juice

00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:31,610
which is still in phase and still going

00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,830
on and notice you must admit

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:38,360
so do you think a night plus semicon

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:41,450
face producing side right now is a time

00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:46,210
to go back to go to the later we have to

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:49,520
wait in all these 204 notes get booted I

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:56,420
hope that you donate or 200 models

00:31:49,520 --> 00:32:00,230
anymore for your insight because some of

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:02,330
them will be redundant some of them you

00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:07,220
can find why they are solutions into

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:10,780
play so in general I think having 201

00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:15,980
uses it's like me their upper limited

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:19,850
feels not good for maintaining for only

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:22,820
any case I've traveled out like you to

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:27,730
check if you can we do something in

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:31,159
just going to go for drupal 8 and first

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:34,350
important to me or to the technology

00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:37,080
by Dennis let's start with what

00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:40,049
virtually let's try to be a child the

00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,009
chance that we first with the stuff that

00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:46,019
we really really need then the blind can

00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:48,090
learn how to play it feels for him and

00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,820
then he can take together with your

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,879
decisions on how he wants to have the

00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,169
rest of the let's say you can already

00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:57,419
for it sixty percent of the

00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:59,580
functionality and then you can decide

00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,440
together with a client okay now you know

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,080
how to pull it looks and how well it

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,990
plays with the sixty percent do we

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,419
really need to forty percent how we're

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,009
going to approach a man when so I don't

00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,860
know how long the project will take for

00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:16,679
you but it hits like a six-month project

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,149
then after three months to Pilate itself

00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,730
will already be much faster you can

00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:23,039
based on the experience that you have

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,629
one big thing aside and the client has

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,100
the experience together you would be

00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:29,639
able to make more informed decisions

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,340
than visit wrong with like water 4 is 28

00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:35,009
the client asks you what are you going

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,860
to be able to deliver in here it's

00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:39,710
impossible the problem arises because

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,500
the point is

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,690
ya know anything about due to several to

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,990
believe he doesn't care doesn't get what

00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:51,669
he carries the physics even heroes were

00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:54,740
to leave so it's very very difficult

00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:56,909
convincing that Drupal 7 the different

00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,639
architecture

00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,169
if really want to sit right now I can

00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:04,950
actually suppose you for the clothes set

00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:07,229
and later we can do legally but Drupal 8

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:12,679
it is an architect and still more put it

00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:17,819
on come on that's the line to draw I

00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:20,609
understand that concept but i try to

00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:24,089
choose projects where I can convince the

00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:27,379
clients that it's related it's not like

00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:27,379
six plus plus

00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:35,060
but you will have to work out that up

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,780
with base Amerika because FBI scope

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,780
inside for me

00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,470
like

00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:06,029
my burden is for this piece of

00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:06,029
information

00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:21,270
like a like a car charge like 10 years

00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,700
old do you really wanna have a copy of

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,380
the same car to the 59th or if you want

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:31,250
to have the latest technology and maybe

00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:34,740
all you have to get another kind of cute

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:38,040
also the person that uses the card has

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,870
been athlete to video and that in the

00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,940
long run you will really be able to

00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:49,400
benefit from all the improvement this

00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,400
disruptive it comes like every tuple

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:57,150
rebooting policeman it will be in

00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,180
December we get closer to that inmate

00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:04,290
what one two three but with a major

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,900
releases from my perspective fly Swift

00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:10,610
like us to be able to migrate from six

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,610
to eight without any cost

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,550
so my

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,329
way to market

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,250
opinion

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:27,020
the

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:33,770
so the question is if you can migrate a

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:36,500
theme from an old to new version well in

00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:40,490
the sentence because if you adapt or

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,619
they'll put a marker to reflect the same

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:46,460
that you have before then you can pour

00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:49,130
the CSS but it will also change like

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,319
custom plate has tweaked so the tablets

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:56,140
will have to change me or you will have

00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:56,140
to write a php-based election

00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:12,919
play

00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:12,919
the stand

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,770
or you can couple it first and in front

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,480
of it and lately I get the back bedroom

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:30,590
there's various ways to approach it but

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,920
they the automatic ultimate upgrade for

00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:35,720
a fee as far as I know doesn't mix maybe

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,200
somebody will buy it some helpers that

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:43,310
will replace a common functionality look

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,710
at the end the game it's a new it's

00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,660
totally new concepts and usually doesn't

00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:52,450
make sense to migrating from six to

00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,450
eight or so actually

00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,249
I'll

00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,990
welcome expert on these items

00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,120
so

00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:50,720
I'll be talking about different about

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:57,620
copies of the same size or are about

00:38:50,720 --> 00:39:01,550
different sized player because when is

00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:05,810
the same site then the CIE system basic

00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:07,850
principles according it important

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:11,780
configuration you you have two different

00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:14,060
types and you are Lisa we need some you

00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:17,420
need something with Bethel's to be able

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,970
to export label functionality with the

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,700
cmi you can actually which components

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:25,310
will export so it is possible and what

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,740
you can also know is you can put the

00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:33,560
configuration that export into the

00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:35,930
configs behold so that it doesn't have

00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:41,590
to live in the big polar but it can also

00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:41,590
making a mortgage be yeah

00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:07,170
