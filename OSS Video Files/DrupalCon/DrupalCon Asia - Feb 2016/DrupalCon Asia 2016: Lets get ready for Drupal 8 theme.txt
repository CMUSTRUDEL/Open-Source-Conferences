finding a teenager on

00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,780
let's get through the ad in lava

00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,430
Oh

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,880
so first of all you going or what with

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:30,290
migration and for why we need to hydrate

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,970
of 22 teams look at seven or six games

00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:37,700
to Tripoli right so we move move Warren

00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,910
and by there and then we'll go go

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,150
through google it you there what we have

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,580
left behind open 7 and what we have a

00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,129
few things coming in independent right

00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,159
so after that we will both with the

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:57,220
migration process what are we willing to

00:00:52,159 --> 00:01:01,519
consider why we are migrating from 27

00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:06,869
well then Tiger fur makes people to a

00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:14,830
small demo as well sequel to a group

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:21,600
editing and reminder that you do it so

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:21,600
let's start the what is migration anyone

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:31,970
okay so conceptually migration migrating

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,000
and holding bedside to a new website

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,880
every single process right it should be

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,500
as simple as this turn off your old

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:47,720
website copy your data or configurations

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:50,479
and turn on the new website site but as

00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,330
soon as you you know go into the details

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:58,479
and I example you will need a backup

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,479
right whenever you are stopped

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,490
I

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:23,480
yes but it will be for profit on your

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:30,260
database my storage not just this is

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:32,000
just for today so in case you mess up

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:36,050
with something right so you need a

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,220
backup backup backup of your website so

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:45,049
that even matter you can go back to your

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:48,650
so the simple looking process just turn

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:51,110
off your own website copy your data and

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,260
turn on the website will become a little

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:59,150
bit you know more staff will be added

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:02,780
here so sing it a better we're migrating

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,640
drupal side side so you will see that

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,989
beautiful vendor when you say take a

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,209
backup of all time if it is a drupal so

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,610
it's not just backin of your whole side

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:16,670
drive it is like you have to back up

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:21,799
your doctor separately you have to back

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:24,290
up your data base and then in your eyes

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,040
of you do fights are somewhere else I

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,180
mean it on other server then you

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,849
you made a copy of that as well right so

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,849
that it simple looking process of you

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,470
know turn out your whole website copy or

00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:42,910
a time

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:45,280
will become we don't complicate the

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,340
drivers so when I we think about my

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:55,680
dress and we it's not a simple process

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:58,780
right so let's not get into this we have

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,210
let's get get back to that question that

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,550
you know what is migration so I wanted

00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:07,300
to just going to describe you find how

00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:10,360
migrations of how the process of

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,120
migration base let's just go see the

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,910
dutiful riding to migrate right any one

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,690
group asleep drupal 7 hood open it why

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,690
you need to mind

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,910
he may cause it to the others ready so

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,990
that there are multiple things like

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:38,170
drupal 8 content as a list of changes

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,530
which you can say we did have a belly

00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:44,460
for sending a new codes where you know

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:49,270
he made large improvements security-wise

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:52,890
performance-wise so let's so there are

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:56,050
month of this but here in the eye lines

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,530
of you know what this will do to the

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:05,800
game right so you have lots of things

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:10,690
work talk to the core right now the core

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:14,350
of group and kate is including html5 so

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:19,930
we get latest for latest marker with the

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:22,500
html5 as you all know we we have to it

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,500
suppose

00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:32,659
so now the Frankie team here or be

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:37,769
improved with with quick and simple ET

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:40,019
Fembots so the great point star there

00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:43,469
was a great point on you right now it is

00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:46,979
import so we can use break points or by

00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:49,589
default out of the box so just we need

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:53,039
to add one point and you can use these

00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:56,189
big points of all of the modules schemes

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,249
and fell off the website so that's how

00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:02,309
grid points to help apart from jQuery

00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:04,439
jQuery seem to gain in poor not a part

00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:07,589
of that you have modernized understood

00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:13,769
birthdays and all up front and related

00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:19,499
libraries as well in Drupal 8 4 so those

00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:22,379
are things with help but these are the

00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:23,470
other few of my own examples or we can

00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,990
say other

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:30,520
teachers apart from those pitches we

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:35,920
have talked about oh yes then no more of

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:37,930
the villages at CSS you have to directly

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,990
go film you can see

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,199
yes aggregation by default any word on

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,680
Putin came to go those are the few other

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,699
things I just wanted to make a point

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,560
here that all the food and Master P just

00:06:51,699 --> 00:07:05,199
again when you my graveyard from Drupal

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:09,160
7 or 6 properly right okay so let's move

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:13,090
to a thin layer of and I wanted to give

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:22,259
you a brief introduction so of you know

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:22,259
what I mean what major point seven eight

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:33,760
okay so why are they asleep so dat must

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:41,020
have good need to know PHP because now

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:44,920
we have 20 / you now have three temp

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:50,170
taking so you know no more need to know

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:53,560
to write this my PSP template and the

00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,510
whole thin layer very insecure so we had

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,750
something like this right you can write

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:01,420
in your ppl anything car together PSD

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:06,460
unit typically drop your reverse table

00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:14,800
it was possible to make a right right so

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:18,940
now by 1 TSP we don't want any he must

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:23,050
must be backing this the idea is also

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,990
now rubinettes in support SVG and all

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,010
those things whatever browsers which are

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:34,590
not supported the which do not support

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:39,430
SVG is now we don't know where and

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:44,290
community has not with any annual dues

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:47,850
and routers of compatibility so the lack

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:52,900
of a browser support for ie8 and video

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:57,120
means mean we don't get more of html5

00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:00,010
and css3 and modern Jake

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,620
Thanks because there is no more support

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,770
to perform will not support I a tank or

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:10,230
helicopters in mobile as my android 2.3

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,230
and video will also we not support it oh

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:21,760
you must be aware of this listing right

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,710
and the Drupal 7 team player right it

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,020
was like you know there were lots of

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,580
team functions there are lots of things

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:33,520
in vines and the team layer was complex

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,780
system and whoever will be working with

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,480
me before they also you know but oh but

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,060
confused on and you don't frustrated

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,820
about the system so this make 2 / 7

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,850
heart to them and is one of the reasons

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:52,870
the learning curve for 250 must work

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:58,270
pillow any knock or you can say it's so

00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:02,410
cute so now no more number seventeen

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:04,130
year this is gone as well so then we

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,550
have

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:11,420
we have the key functions we have a Kiki

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,820
advise the all the King functions and

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,830
their files are are now I've been

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,480
completely removed and other place with

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,580
quick tablets there are too many

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,670
different ways to display content in the

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,480
TPL fights as you said up do you want to

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:32,030
if you are a naughty pic us device if

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,730
you want to take the attributes you are

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,980
completely string right if the variable

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:42,410
was a string variable if you want to

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:44,120
render a Content you had to do it in a

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,680
different way so there are so many

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,590
different ways to digitally content oh

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,600
and there are too many people is that

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,750
right can make parts besides it

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,440
amplifies rumors and also and the thing

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:03,350
functions and the concept was more then

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,380
won't be mad ppl fights of right number

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:10,250
of the advice so people deserve more

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,590
than that and as you say right syntax

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:17,170
highlighting was almost impossible in

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,170
the Drupal 7

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,510
okay so these are the things folder

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,910
thing let's look at the new thing what

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:32,300
you can cackling they took up in here Oh

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:35,120
any questions here not so we have gone

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,910
through the two things we won't see now

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:44,630
introvert 850 left now look at what's

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:47,120
you coming in dinuba late Oh too much to

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:50,829
list here of it but I have tried my best

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:58,370
to cover you know everything that I can

00:11:50,829 --> 00:12:00,380
so first of all to it right whenever you

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,230
are working with people fight whenever

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,620
you will work with if you tell you bout

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,339
a drink it's so simple it's secure and

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,620
it is easy wonder if we go to PNC then

00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,910
as well you will be able to you know

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,990
finish your essay by assessing so do it

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:24,370
I have you also know right hand it's a

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:27,709
php-based of the templating language

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,410
part of synchrony to which is supported

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:33,660
by two

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:35,579
did the trick syntax as I said was it

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,850
will be much more easier than can PSP

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:40,949
templates to it markup language will

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,990
also make living easier to understand

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:44,990
non-programmers will also be able to

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:04,990
so to put it by default supports in the

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,800
html5 output semantics xk 150 so you get

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:13,899
latest mother for all your applications

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:16,750
saying it mobilize a website right and

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:19,360
do believe i don't suppose of responsive

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:22,529
and it ships with responsive features

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,620
such as you have sit responsive

00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:30,579
responsive images synthetics of support

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:34,570
SVG so you have responsive tables their

00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:39,459
phones are all sort of including me to

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:42,000
the phone itself so you can send the

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:52,520
of people put in the group with a

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:55,280
package Paul our sights on a flash stock

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:18,830
directly on the themes which you will be

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:21,140
creating dumb will be content and the

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:26,300
themes less contribute going to see in

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:30,380
the next slide but it so

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,920
let's go to the people right so whoever

00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:36,260
will be working with the Drupal 7 thing

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,270
we know is right hand where you look for

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,970
your seat right where do we put your

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,930
thing he pulled up your custom theme

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:47,030
folder to our family retreat insanity me

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:52,130
the bus less you will go is size of

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:57,470
things right so Drupal 8 eps club drupal

00:16:52,130 --> 00:17:02,030
8 he point us up there is no change it

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:08,620
has to change to whatever your custom

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:08,620
and concise and put it in directly to

00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:18,500
the border that you want to create a

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:20,660
custom theme oh say example p so you

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,330
will put it like this in rupal package

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,300
good things for the hand side that

00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:29,270
people can create custom folder and

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,580
inside that you can put it

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:37,670
for example inside the example for the

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:41,630
right boy 15 you will need is info doc

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:45,050
am i right so input a terrifying drop is

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:48,770
a simple it is path using symphony of

00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,500
pms component you can simply create your

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,530
people again example 5 number our

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:58,190
previous item to write if we want to

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,440
create a example p then what you have to

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:06,290
do is you have to create EMF I for

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:08,300
example got me four or five so now once

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,630
you create this pipe right whenever you

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,940
will you will go to add means less

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,720
appearance now you can see you're in

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:23,050
there so yeah you hated Drupal 8 key

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,050
once you've created to talk in provide

00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:29,209
for it this is the only to certain shade

00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:31,849
of custom being high structure if you

00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:36,379
see nothing has been changed right we

00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:40,309
are working with Drupal 6 ruble 70 and

00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:42,619
do everything you say yes older is a

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,379
penis for that is there there is a

00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:52,729
template folder where you will put your

00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:55,669
only all your ppl pints right so the

00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:58,609
structure folder stuff is not changed my

00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:02,499
speaker there is one change then the

00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:09,589
schema right schema is going to be a

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:14,779
conflict / schema so stuff and the other

00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:20,839
changes of you you and not anymore we

00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:23,929
don't have any movie dot or template by

00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:27,380
right template or PHP file so we have

00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:30,450
instead of them later he will fight you

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:38,780
so there are things I mean not James

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:42,090
much oh ok so now we move to

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:46,500
accidentally while you're here right the

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:49,530
migration partner so next few slides

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,050
down will give you inside of you know if

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,960
you want to convert a trooper 72 rupen

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:57,210
it water changes you need to write what

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,720
are the things you have to consider to

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:09,720
make sure that you successfully fun con

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:15,480
successfully migrated 17 to open it so

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:20,340
it first in person so nothing much here

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:25,290
and you have to download a stupid eight

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:29,130
and install it that's it and then yeah

00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:33,250
once you install if you are going to

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:38,290
Winston's and we will start cooking your

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:39,940
day seven take step right that the next

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,490
thing is you need to create a folder

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:46,140
satellite we we said that if you want to

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:50,650
create your own team that were between

00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:54,700
your custom folder like that corner you

00:20:50,650 --> 00:21:01,630
keep later oh so that's how we will

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:06,730
create folder inside your keys / water

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:09,640
we love you so be necessary parts right

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:13,420
so as I said there is only one nests in

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:17,950
this is your team name talking hold on 5

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:21,720
5 ml oh yes no more you provide pickup

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,720
info so

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:35,020
so let's look at the example of how they

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,880
feel a little slack tide and if you are

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,740
 with roopa seven already who

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,190
puts everything already you will know

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,500
the first month of things right me dying

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,100
description on all these things are

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,650
saying and then there is a syntax

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,710
difference but it's same as you know how

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:56,350
you create a root of everything the next

00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:01,450
part right is types if we move as well

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:05,470
as Facebook it's not Adam here but star

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:11,440
chip stylesheets remove and catch the

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:17,110
pole right are two ways to control some

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:19,480
of the poor CSS four sizes too I don't

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,340
want to remove some of the four files

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:28,830
and you can do

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:31,559
I don't want the menu of dark energy ss5

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:37,289
which is coming from porn so you can

00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:40,559
remove that there in the couch whatever

00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:43,409
scratching to your own point the

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:48,120
library's the libraries are a new

00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:52,110
waiting to our skies spirits in a more

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:57,120
modular fashion oh yeah in order to win

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:59,279
you know reference was inclusive oh and

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,809
beam me to make sure that you know

00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:07,590
whatever you add here to create your

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:12,750
example gun batteries goodbye and post

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:15,720
and the region functions is on region

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:18,779
think like that visually libraries

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:23,039
things that is also similar to what we

00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:27,179
are going into the seven right settings

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,600
again similar to drupal 7 so nothing

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,600
changed

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:39,480
good handling all of things like that

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:39,480
Romney 27 okay

00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:47,730
so break my body is how part of Lupin it

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:50,220
so whatever great points you want to

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:53,899
create right so pleased to be added in

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,899
the examples are a bouncer

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:04,870
this is one you know how to raise your

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:08,940
rate once again goodbye it has mobile

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:13,330
you and you will now have two new rate

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:16,630
media plays all right together CSS file

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:21,929
even define it here and all your module

00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,929
called your custom p will be using this

00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:34,930
okay so P migration process the next

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:41,870
thing is once you know create your core

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:46,760
3.2 RMS by you then have a plea for your

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:52,360
ppl files to infinity to it finds right

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:55,790
oh so here we leave all we need to 25

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,780
ppl finds basically converter you can

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:02,420
fight sing to the 2x and X ah ok and if

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:10,940
you have a page particular PHP you have

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:16,040
to convert that into HTML yes we have a

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:17,810
very cool feature 125 video / project

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,530
last period by that will convert their

00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,669
models and things to completely basic

00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,629
feature

00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:29,409
I know your argument of my being I mean

00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:29,409
those files to be

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,760
for the skins are writing everything

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:41,820
there it is everything everything crime

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:46,990
than improving I other of Drupal console

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:49,360
so that you have you have to write 11

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,280
gamma and it will ask you all the

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,870
details and you put all the difference

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,680
and it will automatically period your

00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:01,590
people to again with by libraries

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,590
document by all the sparkly bottom

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,059
new arrival it was seventeen to be

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,059
comforted

00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:11,950
we give in

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:19,770
yes you are modified also you know it

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,160
will give you bunch of things that you

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:29,520
think you are okay then convert it for

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:32,910
you and then this curve some work work

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,830
going on there it's in meat I guess even

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,830
aware of 25 model

00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:47,270
for to the central but it fits in theta

00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:51,620
all in alpha is that it's in alpha right

00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,620
but you can use this to convert

00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:02,910
okay the final step is to process

00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,780
functions luckily we don't have any more

00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:11,460
changes in you know p process function

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,200
better if you need to do that image in

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,020
one of the page that if they find you

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,070
can still do that increase field office

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:22,980
functions so thank over your page that

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:27,270
are actually better quit fighting will

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:32,640
be able to use those emails so give us a

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:36,510
thumbs in ur not washed it and finally

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,580
we have something so there is no much

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,580
change there as well you just have to

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:49,460
include the base be back something's

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,460
info

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:59,220
but any bus is here yes for example if

00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,220
you have a base

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:23,649
so basting needs to be converted into

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:25,629
okay okay right if you just want to you

00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:28,299

follow this process of your APA driving

00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:34,539
45 and if you don't have the bootstrap

00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:38,289
put it as it will go ahead you just have

00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:46,799
to remove the base of line from your

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:46,799
info fight it will work as units

00:28:55,769 --> 00:29:02,300
so that whether a spiritually and

00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:04,480
