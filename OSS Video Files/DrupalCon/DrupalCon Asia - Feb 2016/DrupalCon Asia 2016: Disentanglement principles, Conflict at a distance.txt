my name is Marcus Oren and I hope EHD

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,700
not in conflict resolution Maggie she's

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,870
in very frequency setting mobile phones

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:19,439
my biggest toiletries tell people

00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:21,829
premium safe science said but I do not

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,439
feel about conflict resolution in

00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,849
especially distributed communities and

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,529
the kind of communities where people

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,060
sometimes see each other sometimes they

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,410
only know each other by our mailing

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,089
lists so having done by mentioning our

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,460
safety I've spent a lot of my time

00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:39,629
around engineers and scientists and

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,000
coders and people who consider

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,400
themselves to have excellent standards

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,440
of conflict resolution and excellent

00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,280
ways of dealing with each other yes I

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,960
can see those snorts I can hear you

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,030
actually I you say that as an engineer

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,430
who had that opinion of myself I pop

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,379
hauling up hauling skills at this I can

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,019
tell you so I'm mostly going to tell you

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,820
us some war stories and the kinds of

00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:05,909
things I've learned from them and the

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,650
kinds of things i learned from looking

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,509
at other people's experiences and

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,080
frameworks and research and how to do

00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:14,460
this kind of thing maybe at the end if

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,120
we have time you'll be surprised

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:24,450
participation in this is yawning okay

00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,610
the first thing I learned is that one of

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,200
the biggest roles people seem to assume

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,700
about communities is that everyone

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,770
should be welcomed right let's let's

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,230
let's take a pretty happy view of things

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,760
in most communities people say anyone

00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,950
who can contribute especially at

00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,720
something called a meritocracy should be

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:49,230
welcomed it's not necessarily true

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,930
line number one you do need filters and

00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:56,400
if you've got filter failure that's when

00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:01,500
you have problems okay here is one of my

00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:04,740
first one my favorite war stories so in

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,600
Australia there's a as in many other

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,459
parts of the world's there's conventions

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,780
where people get together and talk about

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,490
science fiction and fantasy stories and

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:20,400
books and fanfiction all kinds of things

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:21,690
and in 2009 one of the almond 20 members

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,930
of the community contacted the

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,300
organizers and said hey there's this

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,840
person is going to be there I think can

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,590
you tell me if they're there because are

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,980
they sexually assaulted me and I didn't

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,350
happen at an event so these events

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,209
happen once a year so most of the

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,670
community knows each other through

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,290
distributed ways through online through

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,320
maybe running into each other straight

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,010
as big place I mean there's only 12

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:59,510
people there but it is a big place

00:02:52,010 --> 00:03:02,340
spotless Ravens giggling yeah um so the

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,670
organizers went wow that's that's that's

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,260
intense they spoke to the person and he

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,890
said yeah no that really happened I'm

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,080
really

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,840
to do it I didn't realize that that was

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,819
a problem at the time so you know it

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,840
wasn't even a question of he said she

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,890
said there was a quick confession and

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
when we're do this started getting out

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,600
to the community and there were

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,060
conversations about okay how do we

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,500
resolve this and who can attend what and

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,420
maybe we can create a situation where

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,520
you can both attend some parts of the

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,260
convention there was oh my god oh you

00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,140
can you can still feel the echoes of

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:47,130
those conversations from 2009 on today's

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:49,860
internet gold uh but it made people

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,769
think about what's acceptable and

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,709
despite the conversations of well that

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,300
couldn't have happened or he's a pretty

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,840
good guy so we should let him here

00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,860
anyway the community decided to

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,750
establish much tighter controls about

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,230
who could attend what and how to retain

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:14,280
things and also make them do a few other

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:17,880
things as well one of the things that

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,590
they did was listen just walking and

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,180
listen to people and not asking them to

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,729
any invasive questions about what

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,229
happened but have a think about what

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,240
actually know you can you tell me what

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:33,150
happened can you tell me what you want

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,470
ah they model good behavior oh sorry did

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,950
you want to take a photo of that finger

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,660
are they model good behavior so they

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,730
walked around and

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,010
if you even got together in Bandung and

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,420
around the situation went what are we

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,190
going to do about is how we going to

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,070
change our community from being the kind

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,390
of place where people say things like he

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,370
might have sexually assaulted someone

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,370
but he's a really nice guy so he should

00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:00,420
be here to the kind of place we want to

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,580
come to and they decided to just walk

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,630
around and be clear about what's okay

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,670
and they talk to people and they were

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,800
kind and they were nice and they spoke

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,050
publicly about their opinion and they

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,730
spoke publicly and kindly and quietly

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:21,120
about the kind of community they wanted

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:24,420
it to be in 2009 unrelatedly entirely

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,580
unrelated Lee Alex Bailey who's pretty

00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,930
famous for being famous on the internet

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,790
you know for being an awesome open

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,780
source developer and a community manager

00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,550
at the time give a keynote at oscon are

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,800
talking about recruiting diversity and

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,310
her point was that you've got to start

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,070
with the diversity you want to see that

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,170
applies for everything if you want a

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,020
community that behaves well you want to

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,460
start the community well and if you're

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,650
already down the wrong track than what

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,270
you want to do is leave it it is create

00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,370
a situation we all leaving it where

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,410
you're one of the people that are making

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:07,700
it a different kind of place this is a

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:11,210
photo of the at the time the dream worth

00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,790
getting too big nor drink with this

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,160
design i remember livejournal

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,370
does anyone even know what livejournal

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,440
is ok it was a blogging platform back

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:27,590
when those kinds of things were a little

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,940
cooler than now and it was a publicly

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,860
accessible place where anyone who got a

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,470
blog a little bit like WordPress but not

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,870
not at all really like WordPress but in

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,750
some ways a big like adding that invited

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,580
offer the same kind of features but

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,590
after a while they started treating some

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,250
of their members pretty badly refusing

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,490
some content closing accounts so some of

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,280
their developers left and created a

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,510
competitive program a competitive

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,760
service which is basically the same

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:03,620
thing but better called dream with and

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,990
this is the diversity statement we

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,790
welcome you we welcome people of any

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,070
gender identity or expression race

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:13,190
ethnicity size nationality sexual

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,620
orientation ability lemon neurotype we

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,780
welcome fans geeks nerds pixel staying

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,340
técnicas and whipped riches we welcome

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,620
Internet beginners who I'm sure what any

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,660
of those terms refer to you might wear a

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,970
baby sling and a job and keep our a

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,070
leather piercings a pentacle anything so

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,860
this was their diversity statement this

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,680
was then standing up for the community

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,740
that they wanted to see them all good

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,880
behavior their diversity statement is

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,400
still one of the best I've ever seen why

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,730
do they want to do that first thought

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,040
you have a community evaluation wanted

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,800
there are some people in the community

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,430
whose boundaries aren't as clearly

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,300
enforceable as other people's sometimes

00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,909
there

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,360
sometimes the Queen people sometimes

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:04,699
they're poor people sometimes the people

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,349
of a different race sometimes they're

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:10,460
people wear a lot of jewelry through

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:12,770
their eyeballs and society generally use

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:18,590
those people as less worthy of having

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:21,919
their filters and forced your job to do

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,750
it if you can it's a really nice thing

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,449
to be able to stand up for other people

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:30,219
who might not have the freedom to do it

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,510
for themselves but doing the kind way

00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,250
it's not always what you think is going

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:39,769
on I've been in a lot of situations

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:41,329
where one person saying look this

00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,649
person's really upset me and they heard

00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:43,640
me there shouldn't be here in fact I

00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,160
don't engage you the one to this

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,620
community at all any turns up after

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,180
listening to them that actually both

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,339
people can co-exist but both God we're

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,899
both ends are okay and what you've got

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,149
is a culture clash some people think

00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,740
that there's one thing going on I'll all

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,709
that the community is about something

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,930
else and other people think that there's

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,690
something else going on very important

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,149
to be able to just listen to them and

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,480
you can do that via email as well and

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,800
it's hard Eddie's not fun means that I

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,800
have to try and resolve conflict

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:24,850
those people with a thousand ask okay

00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:26,559
one of the other things that the people

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,569
in the speculative science which is

00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:33,040
really miss that stacked the odds okay

00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:34,360
so they set them on themselves and then

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,189
when we want to change the community

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,319
road who's going to be on the board next

00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:40,089
year right what about the year after

00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:42,550
that and the year after that maybe that

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:46,389
for three years running they figured out

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,740
who was going to put forward the effort

00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:49,540
of being on the board and they did it in

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,759
a systematic way so that none of the

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,300
more out all at once they all wore out

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,369
eventually it's hard doing something but

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,199
they had a really serious programming

00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:01,480
place where who's going to be on the

00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,100
board and who's going to be on the

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,529
conference organizing committee who is

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,119
going to be contacting people who's

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:10,179
going to be writing the anti-harassment

00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:11,889
policy and they they actually change

00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,540
that they got together and they they sat

00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,740
in the background there's always you

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,790
know there's always the net to channel

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,929
there's the channel where everyone's

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,519
talking and then there's the channel

00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:21,459
where everyone's talking about how you

00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:26,769
talk to each other they stack the odds

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:29,230
in the meta channel it's not considered

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:31,149
very nice to isolate the problem person

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,360
but it's actually been shown in a bunch

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:36,189
of different studies every time there's

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,799
a study that talks about how do you

00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:41,829
change the culture to worthless one of

00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:45,999
the highest value things that can happen

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:50,709
in our workplace is to remove the one or

00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:53,130
two really toxic people and most studies

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:56,040
will come across if you're looking in

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,660
those improvements will either avoid the

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,990
shopping entirely or focus on our very

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:06,360
strongly removing the problem like one

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,870
or two serious problem people has more

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,080
increased value for an organization than

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:19,350
any collection of workshops anyway days

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:23,160
any kind of team building exercises yeah

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:27,360
education is inoculation vaccinate your

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,010
community against how you don't want

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,410
them to behave what is acceptable and

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,780
what is not acceptable the people of

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,060
this particular convention they are for

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,400
several years in a row started running

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,880
as a parallel track to everything else

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:45,690
in the conference safe spaces workshops

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,860
which was all about how to save yes how

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:52,050
to say no what is consent what is okay

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,330
how do you ask for consent how do you

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,670
establish it how do you establish safety

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,070
how do you make yourself a safe person

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,940
to be around why would you want to do

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,520
that and it wasn't even with the aim of

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,080
that they never talked about this is to

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,080
stop sexual harassment happening again

00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,650
although opposite ease but it was to

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,840
give people the tools to deal with how

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,400
to behave the next time they were in an

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,730
animal

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,560
situation whether it was when someone's

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,690
accused them or something that they

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,820
weren't sure they've done or how to

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,190
recognize when they might Lee about

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,460
cross a boundary or have to just stand

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,950
out for themselves and you know what

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,520
it's a really different place now the

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:40,220
entire sci-fi convention world in

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,560
Australia small and incestuous as it is

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,120
like all other worlds in Australia is

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:56,450
very differently ok this is another

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:58,520
story pretty famous open source female

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,650
lead project in fact a thing for a long

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,170
time there were at ninety-five percent

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:07,400
female contributors I'm not going to

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,200
name it uh they had all kinds of

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,870
problems they had various different

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:17,750
kinds of boards and again this is a

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:19,790
situation where the meta channel wasn't

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,560
this is actually situational the meta

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,240
channel was the problem they had several

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,490
meta channels and they hadn't spoken to

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,770
each other well enough and there are a

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,720
couple of toxic people around and nobody

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:36,170
knew how to deal with them and nobody

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,880
knew what to do about it so I you know

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,530
I've spoken to a lot of the people who

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,360
are involved in it one-on-one or in

00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:44,390
groups and a lot of the same kind of

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,330
thing which is we just didn't know how

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,060
to get past the barriers and they had

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,630
online channels and they talk to each

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,820
other and sometimes they needed to

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,260
things like just a game model the

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,210
behavior one of them would sit around

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,300
and welcome any newbie and we'd sit

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,120
around through the testers and say so

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,040
giving a bug report to a developer it's

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,970
kind of like telling them they have an

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,820
ugly baby be gentle with it ask

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,940
questions you know don't walk in and see

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,250
I can't work with this is a rubbish that

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,200
I'm going to get you very far here's

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,940
another situation maybe you can poke him

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,190
and say I don't really know how to start

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,890
developing or testing this can you give

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:31,110
me a hand understanding the code and

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:33,930
that made a big difference and the

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,700
channels and the meta channels could get

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,690
better and then before us an uncle

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:42,870
better and then got worse but overall

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:46,560
they get pretty well I'm going to come

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,899
back to that one okay one of the things

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,809
you need to be able to do in

00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:55,319
is knowing who to talk to it how to

00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:58,920
address a problem so you've encountered

00:14:55,319 --> 00:15:01,019
a situation someone's accused you of bad

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,339
behavior or you've encountered bad

00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,470
behavior maybe because of the confidence

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,720
event maybe for post conference events

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,790
may be equals online meet someone same

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,230
thing what would I do I don't have to

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,519
like to walk up to everyone and tell

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,240
them that I'm embarrassed that this

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,790
guy's felt me up here that I think I've

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,160
done something really bad I just want to

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,199
find somebody to talk to quietly so very

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,439
formal you be able to make those choices

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:27,240
visible to your community let them know

00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,249
who to contact have an email address

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,730
have a twitter account have people in

00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:37,350
t-shirts something this is work

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,749
reinforcing boundaries teaching people

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:45,300
creating filters it's hard it's labor it

00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:49,379
was going to make your organization it's

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,509
going to make it make or break it like

00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:54,929
in a lot of ways it's what's going to

00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:57,149
make your organization better than much

00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,329
more than whether you can sell budgets

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,040
or better

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,839
the kind of code you can do this is

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,160
what's going to make it you know that

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,110
there's that saying but how people don't

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,290
leave jobs organizations they leave

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,360
bosses or they leave their workmates

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,809
this is the same kind of thing what you

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,639
want is somebody making the place safe

00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:17,499
so when you are thinking about how to

00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,079
set up a community or how to resolve the

00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:22,360
conflicts thinks about how you're going

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,399
to moderate it and how you're going to

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:30,850
compensate that either with money or

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:32,559
with something else one of the things

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,089
you can do is lower the barrier of entry

00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,199
for the more vulnerable people or people

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:40,420
who don't to speak up sometimes the

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:43,179
conflicts arise because people feel like

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,860
they can't speak about one and they

00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:47,799
can't speak about them because they're

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,029
part of a minority group or I know maybe

00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,459
they have a disability and they don't

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,740
have to call anyone ask up every time

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:56,020
and say I mean

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,910
the stairs are so they don't show up or

00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,920
their snack you on a mailing list about

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,110
it which is there enough up is nothing I

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,340
mean it's not a fun or a nice thing to

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,560
be but I can really understand why

00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,630
they've been angry what you want to do

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,760
is lower the barrier of entry for people

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:15,730
who can't do it for themselves

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:17,610
necessarily or for whom it's Adam ah one

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,810
of the coolest stories have heard is

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,450
there's a little corner of the internet

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,490
called metafilter Macy for short and

00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:27,940
then there they were read it before

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:30,340
reddit they saw online there are really

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:34,180
unattractive website actually really

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,740
flame what they do is they keep like

00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,900
they have a moderator that they pay

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,680
their very clear on on their moderation

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,900
rules they charge people five dollar

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,830
annual fee to participate with an

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,960
immediate post right I mean it's a small

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,090
sum of money but the pain of you know

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,920
dealing with paypal or credit cards or

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,990
whatever to create an account to move in

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,660
and do all that means that they are less

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,250
likely to get stands there looks likely

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,580
to get the kind of people who are going

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:06,040
to be short of hands in the ass that'd

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,210
Roy you know you're less likely to get

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,760
better people who are going to be

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,030
difficult if there is a small barrier to

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,710
participation remember that everyone who

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,410
is in a more vulnerable position is

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,810
making a cost-benefit

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:23,870
before they pushed anything anyone

00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:29,450
vulnerable has this is there anything if

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:34,040
i say my opinion on this forum am I

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:37,700
going to get backlash people who don't

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,650
have to think that make it a 10 maybe

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,360
you can make that a little more fear for

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,920
them one of the good things to make

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,690
clear is that there's no cuticle

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:54,920
behavior you like there's no opt-out you

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,690
just are you up yeah there's no

00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,390
opportunity behavior you can opt out by

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:07,250
leaving and it's okay like it's really

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:09,590
okay to me the community fine the best

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,870
way to do things these to create code

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,170
conduct yes you have people yes

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:18,540
now you behave the realities you already

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:22,559
have a credit product your community has

00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:25,110
unspoken rules of ways in which it is ok

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:30,120
not ok to behave for for example we are

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:33,960
all wearing clothes I didn't think about

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,750
it today did you we have all these

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,250
assumed assumptions about life that life

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,620
teaches us and sometimes the group

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,020
teaches us by subtle punishment or

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,700
subtle encouragement about what's okay

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,420
what's not okay so creating total

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,510
product is actually just formalizing the

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,700
rules of what things are here's an

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,530
example of a code of conduct that your

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,500
community might not want but if you cant

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:02,510
pretend this is one of the channels of

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:10,080
anonymous there are no who anonymous is

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:14,540
there hmm very disparate online group of

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,280
people who behave as among other things

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,650
activists against whatever causes they

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,330
feel like and initially they were all

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,600
anonymous at the point that nobody knew

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:30,660
they were some of them have come to

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:32,280
light since the point is the their code

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,960
of conduct is not necessarily what you

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,190
want but this is the code of conduct at

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,530
work for them this is one of our

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,480
channels nobody kicks nobody bands

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,429
inside this channel you don't interrupt

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,679
another person's channel personal

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:49,110
disputes are taboo that's often a good

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:52,740
one but you know sometimes like the last

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:55,050
one over here so don't expect the IRC

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,160
cops to handle your problems for you try

00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,679
and resolve it yourself that's not

00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,270
always true some communities prefer to

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,050
have more

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,610
you get involved earlier be specific

00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:08,930
about what is and isn't okay be specific

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:15,340
about what you can and can't do does

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:19,760
this look familiar this is the drupal

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,400
conflict resolution guidelines they're

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,350
really good and when I read them I went

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,650
wow there's a community that's dealt

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:30,500
with conflict because like you can

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,750
always tell who hasn't hasn't dealt with

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:37,360
problems by house for sick if they are

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:40,940
in what to do when it happens like like

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,890
there's um there's a condom packet you

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,230
can buy where one of the instructions is

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:51,170
please do not send used product that

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:52,820
accompany yeah I don't think those kinds

00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:59,720
of rules developed by accident they

00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:02,420
develop when someone's done it yeah how

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,770
many consequences yeah okay once you've

00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,020
got a code of conduct once you've

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,000
created a boundary the only way to

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,550
enforce it is cleared fast clear and

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,190
hard real quick you don't want there to

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:16,190
be any questions that the code of

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,780
conduct has been enforced if you need to

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,440
be kind you need to be gentle you need

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,380
to hear all sides but you need to do

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,960
your foot your only chance as having an

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:31,720
effective boundary is to enforce it the

00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:34,930
first time it's broken yep like a bank

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,450
people it's not the first result it's

00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,090
rarely the first result anything is

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,530
maybe that's not the community for you

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:45,760
maybe it is the community for you that's

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:48,220
your choice but remember it is your role

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,230
to ensure the things are in fact

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,390
resolved and one of the ways to resolve

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,010
them is to revisit is to visit

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,740
consequences and one of the consequences

00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,130
are being asked to leave the community

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:03,460
holguin bank now this is what my

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:06,670
favorite stories okay 2005 yukon a cubic

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,190
on is a conference about security that

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,660
happens in new zealand once a year they

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,580
call themselves the absolute best one

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:17,710
it's true they're also the only one

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:23,980
they're very clear to say that in 2005

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:27,940
15 so december last year they had the

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:30,580
keynote speaker personal invite a friend

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,400
of the organizers stood on stage and

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:40,690
made a transphobic joke as part of their

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:42,550
speech and I the organizers guide a

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,870
sudden shock okay and let them finish

00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:50,500
and took inside and set them down and

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,970
said what the hell was that and make

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,870
them pack their bags and leave the

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,720
conference then

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,610
well I don't feel that you don't have a

00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,650
hotel stay for the night I don't care

00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:04,540
where you're going next you're leaving

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:07,090
now my favorite story just the clearest

00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:10,600
public declaration that we are going to

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:13,000
make this place safe for you and you

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,010
know i'm sure those people the organizer

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,040
in the speaker later had a lot of words

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,990
and later had a lot of conversation for

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,820
that their own internal conflict and

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,090
what even is no Kane who embarrassed who

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,940
actually but they learn about it and

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:31,450
look this was there a report about the

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:33,309
conference we had cyber flames noises

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,170
significant facial damage hackers

00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:37,870
crackers jackers directors and as far as

00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,700
we know only one bigger they also

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,230
removed all other references to this

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,840
person from their conference remove

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:51,390
their all the stuff from the program so

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,390
you can't find my name but they did it

00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:58,450
they were kind by being kinds of their

00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:03,460
community you know there was no question

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:05,070
of what happened if you can be public

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,220
about what's going on

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,840
even if the conflict is private have the

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,970
conversations in private but have a

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,649
public conversation mention it somewhere

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,500
it's really important to let people know

00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:18,029
that if there is a problem someone will

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,750
step in someone will do something about

00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:27,450
it it will be dealt with and you're not

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:31,200
the only one dealing with it you also to

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,970
choose yours that you know in a

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,850
situation he's actually said in a

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,190
situation of two people at least one of

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,769
those people is heard enough said right

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,549
at the least one of those people has had

00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:47,129
probably potentially something awful

00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:48,570
happen to them maybe Marley awful but by

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,669
the time they speaking to a moderator

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,559
it's not my lineage I think you know how

00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,080
people normally wait until there's a

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,070
problem before they talk to someone you

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,440
get to choose your side girl oh yeah

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,590
okay so I'm going to tell you one of

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,129
those awful stories from my life a long

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:12,210
time ago I was president of a community

00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:16,830
of a community the dealt with

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:18,299
alternative sexualities so again I mean

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,159
it had nothing to do with software but

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:24,029
there were a lot of people there who

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,580
were hardly distributed mostly see each

00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:27,200
other

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,570
the month they'd be a lot of

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:36,550
conversations online on gmail and

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:39,650
facebook on forums and we have a case of

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:47,120
somebody accusing their partner of

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:49,550
domestic violence happens and we as a

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,110
group had to seriously think about what

00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:58,100
to do about it how do we get our app

00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:01,640
thanks for that ok so maybe the police

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,980
are involved maybe they're not it's a

00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,510
group that deals with relationships so

00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,430
people have relationships within the

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:10,010
group it's not like but for example if

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,470
we've been organizing a driving alcohol

00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:16,340
recovery group there there are rules

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:19,310
that say things like avoid dating anyone

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,510
within this community it wasn't like

00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,640
that people date each other all the time

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:26,750
and one of the decisions we came to is

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:30,590
that because we know this and because it

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:32,660
was a relationship based situation if

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,660
there are people around who are abusive

00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,490
in relationships and we know that then

00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,560
by allowing them in the group who would

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,570
de facto standing up for them and the

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,990
same this person isn't ok person to date

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:47,120
and it was a lot of big conversations

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,740
about if you know is it our job to save

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,940
people from crack relationships will

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,830
know but abusive maybe you know what do

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,600
we do about that and we didn't know what

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,820
to do and there were months and there

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,900
were terrible terrible situations and

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,830
all my god with the worst thing i think

00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,930
i did in that situation was create a

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,160
group discussion where I knew not

00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,760
everyone is capable of

00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:18,090
what was going on but we decided to have

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,679
a consensus-based agreement about what

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,570
to do with this person and therefore

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,200
with the community guidelines as a whole

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,900
and so that meant we had to have all of

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:33,600
them can be all of the organizers agree

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:35,670
before we did something I can't even

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,830
tell you how much that yeah okay yeah

00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:40,140
every year people who've tried this is

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,830
shaking their hands all I can tell you

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,919
is don't do that like there are good

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,590
ways to build consensus but in order to

00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,900
have consensus based decision making you

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,910
first need to have years of training and

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,340
community in how to come to the incident

00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,320
consensus based decision and if you

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,770
don't have which elects to do politics

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,590
does a lot but if you don't have that in

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,750
place then the moment there's a conflict

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:10,080
you're dealing with how to resolve

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:13,549
conflicts and you barely get to what do

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,549
we do about this particular conflict

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,170
so for a time we thought we were off

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,490
topic or maybe we're off of the values

00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,290
maybe we'll went on the rounds of the

00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,030
community so we had to reestablish them

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,850
maybe we weren't talking about what was

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:31,540
the right thing actually what we decided

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:33,550
was something else now tell you about

00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:37,990
that in a minute another story from a

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:39,970
little more recently I I've just been on

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:43,929
the board of the Australian Open

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:47,370
Knowledge Foundation which is an arm of

00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:49,540
the global / knowledge group and

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,580
whooping around for a long time and we

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,110
do things that are open and that's

00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,679
everything from open government to

00:29:53,110 --> 00:30:02,260
science to education to data to you name

00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:04,240
it and we having an email in a long time

00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,510
in Norman we've had a really sensational

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,550
community things are so good we wrote

00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:14,380
our own code of conduct for Australia we

00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:16,120
have weekly events we have a thriving

00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,640
community we constantly have new

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,860
volunteers to come and do stuff you like

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:27,429
that is a real sign of her of a thriving

00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:29,440
world um and then just recently we've

00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:33,820
got into a massive fight on the language

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,440
the monthly I'm organizers so it was you

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,170
know it ended up being one city versus

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,100
another city and what we came to realize

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,890
is that we weren't thank you we went off

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,800
topic or of values we were something

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:50,260
else we didn't know how to talk as

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,370
moderators what we didn't have was the

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,779
right structure for us

00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,909
what I learned is that you can't make

00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:00,640
anyone do anything this is all this

00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:03,070
happened when I was in India I was

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,529
looking in Hyderabad I am for a year or

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,149
two and all of this was happening in

00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:08,620
australia and i was watching the mailing

00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:10,600
list and watching Twitter feed and

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,950
started to cry because these are all

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,299
people I care about what are they doing

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,039
fighting with each other and this is a

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:17,909
community I actually built from scratch

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:21,750
like all of us started with nothing and

00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:25,450
South America so you know there were

00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:26,679
midnight phone calls and 6am phone calls

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,960
to try and catch people at the right

00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,240
time zones and I'm so sorry that

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,880
happened to you and ok can you tell me

00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,919
what happened what's going on can we

00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,750
have a phone conversation altogether all

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,059
right what I learned is that i couldn't

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,980
make any one apologizes anyone like i

00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,380
couldn't make anything happen I could

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,510
just talk with people I could give him

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,649
information I could create any situation

00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:52,840
i watered but he was up to them I tried

00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:54,370
to create nice list you know one of the

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,020
things that did work was making less

00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,730
distance was even though people were

00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,529
distributed getting them all together

00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,419
into the same room you really do the

00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:03,370
same conference call made a big

00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:06,600
difference you know they're human now

00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:12,539
this isn't just some person losing

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:15,480
list Oh find really annoying it's always

00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,980
personal it's always somebody's upset

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,610
you've got to remember that someone's

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,929
upset actually it's not about logic like

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,429
yeah there's a logical reasons and

00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:26,250
there's time for logical conversations

00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:29,280
but it's not the first responsive go to

00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,770
deal with yeah we're off topic or our

00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,960
values actually what we need to know was

00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:37,110
how to resolve moderator things and

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,659
what's happening in Australia is that we

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,250
are to distributed and we haven't come

00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:45,120
to an agreement about how to deal with

00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,740
moderator conflicts and we don't know

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,140
what one will discover is that we don't

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,730
have conversations among moderators

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,169
enough so like the melding group is

00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,120
really active the senior group is really

00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:56,880
active each of the different cities is

00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,710
functioning very well but intercity we

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,799
don't have agreement about what our

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:06,600
culture is best advice I can give you is

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,830
to have the most awkward conversation

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,470
you can possibly think of start early

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:16,140
think about it it's your job to like

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,450
it's as anyone who's kind of a community

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,030
it's your job to make things less open

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,580
for other people sometimes that means

00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:27,780
being really awkward for human

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,460
dying we've got a normalize it you've

00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:34,020
got to make it normal that'll make it

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,370
okay to have conflict the best way to do

00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,360
it is to sit down with someone and say

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,390
how do you want to talk about things

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,910
when we have conflict what makes you

00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,740
feel more listen to what what kind of

00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:46,650
words do you want we do not use what

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,600
makes you angry how do we resolve what

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:51,390
we're doing how can we talk amongst

00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:56,070
ourselves what do you want out of a

00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:58,350
resolution if you're not doing that what

00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,510
you're normalizing is unresolved

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,960
conflict is people not resolving stuff

00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:06,900
is people leaving these people not

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,430
talking to each other is I'm not going

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:14,490
to that event if you're invited that

00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:17,460
person oh yeah so there's this really

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,410
good framework for thinking about among

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,990
other things conflict resolution Walter

00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:23,100
that values in the workplace really

00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:26,870
we're thinking about giving voice to

00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:31,350
values one of the things I talk about is

00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:34,200
think about what helps you speak up one

00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:36,060
of the things that makes things work

00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,460
really well is knowing ahead of time

00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,100
what's going to make it easier to talk

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,230
on behalf of someone else on behalf of

00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,290
yourself when value is a breached what

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,420
are your bad news but what sort of story

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:52,890
do you tell yourself about who you are

00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:55,620
am i a brave person okay in that case I

00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:58,680
can talk because I'm feeling brave MIT

00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,570
meant am I like really shy okay but do

00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,880
you like complying with values do you

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,850
like complying in the rules in that case

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,720
maybe helps you speak up when there are

00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,980
clear rules

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,690
know that you're following them maybe

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,700
it's because you're whatever stories you

00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,680
tell yourself you know the story I tell

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,750
myself in a picture is that I need and

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,400
I'm really like plants that was

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,010
productive of my life in an airport

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,950
after I've taken some black pepper

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,359
candies from somewhere one of the other

00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:28,530
stories I tell myself is that I get

00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,450
really angry totally not that true but I

00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,820
found for a long time that really helped

00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:38,790
me like thinking about about in terms of

00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:41,060
anger at injustice ha's ok what's the

00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,060
time now

00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:47,160
one thing excellent we've got time okay

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,140
and it's a small group so we're

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,970
definitely going to be able to do it so

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,680
anyone who ever heard this phrase when

00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:57,510
is the best time to plant a tree the

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,400
best time is 20s though you know you

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,690
want to start your community with a code

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,980
of conduct you want to start your

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,500
community with good ways of resolving

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,570
conflict second best time is right now

00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,420
so what we're going to do okay we're

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,800
going to do the cliff now it's time for

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,540
the audience participation kind of

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,330
things I would like you to find a

00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,710
partner person you're seeing mixture is

00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,360
really good if you're not sitting next

00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,650
to anyone and you don't want to that's

00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,480
your choice if you do want to get

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:27,600
involved find yourself a partner and

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,970
here's what we're going to do you're

00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:35,400
going to trip over there and try not to

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:37,170
die that's what you're gonna do what

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,650
you're going to do is think about the

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,780
conversation you want to have a list the

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,610
most awkward conversation you can think

00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,890
of many through the parents maybe to the

00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:49,980
partner maybe to come in at work maybe

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:52,620
two new boss maybe to the kids anything

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,920
yourself think about that conversation

00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,260
that makes you just the early you know

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,660
that the listing that suddenly makes you

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,510
wanna play candy crush and and run away

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,130
and an end and watch rubbish television

00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,950
no no I want to do anything else talking

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,710
about it think about that and practice

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,500
having it right the best thing you can

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,920
do is get yourself ready for the

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,110
situations before they occur right the

00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,480
best thing that's going to help you be

00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,100
awkward and no

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,930
deal with a problem the reason the code

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,390
of conducts we've conference resolution

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:30,800
is because people have anticipated what

00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:32,060
to do when a problem arises so you're

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,820
probably going to have to deal with

00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:37,190
whatever it is that you're avoiding find

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,590
somebody each of you think about the

00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,270
conversation you don't want to have and

00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,640
drop have a role play with a person next

00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,720
to you about that conversation just try

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,510
and have it with someone right now

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,510
prepare yourself you go

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,510
are you

00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,060
to put

00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,060
Wow

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,569
premiums

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,009
I was almost as you used to

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,170
No

00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,140
is it every single time

00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,069
because I

00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,759
just sugar to that

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,060
this usually happens is people I

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:24,100
selected

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,230
for this

00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,859

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,890
people s or 5000 volunteers so I'd be a

00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,039
lot people a lot of time faculty i said

00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:23,040
i'm quoting you know

00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:26,750

bye ya seen a lot of the google oh yeah

00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,859
sorry well so one of the things i had

00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,319
questioned about you know imagine the

00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:56,359
science fiction

00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:56,359
how kind of catalyst

00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:04,270
yep any version that is so much

00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:06,760
and I was curious how much you drink

00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:10,500
that but obviously things like the

00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,500
safeSpace workshops just excellent

00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:15,180
instead of opportunity

00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:18,300
who want to be empowered

00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,280
but I'm curious that's a single but how

00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:23,250
much of that was also a jury

00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,690
like people like a delivery room like

00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,400
you're no longer welcome here but also

00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,470
nutrition in that

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,460
if you're doing safe space or tops this

00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,140
is no longer my community

00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,359
certain people self-selecting to leave

00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:38,460
why we only

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,589
under josh everett environment the

00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:44,759
question was in the site a community was

00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:47,489
talking about seeing the communities

00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:49,980
better collages that is a tribute all

00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:51,930
through the efforts of these people

00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,850
taking specifically black the safeSpace

00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:58,200
workshop of how much is it due to the

00:47:53,850 --> 00:48:01,050
attrition and I think the money you

00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,670
create rules that say this kind of

00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,440
things letter came here the kind of

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:08,040
people who behave like that are less

00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,630
likely to be there or to say there or to

00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,609
behave like that because it's more

00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:13,859
encouraged and there's a police that

00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:16,890
piece of paper somewhere that says

00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:18,720
that's what they came and that's more

00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,000
acceptable you especially that's

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,550
probably

00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,340
and the selfs life al is actually the

00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:30,930
simplest way that communities inverted

00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,930
we call this community

00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:41,039
the people who don't value of that in a

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:44,069
leaf or an angel by direct or indirect

00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:47,730
behavior our punishment or buying actual

00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:52,450
bad time yes please note the

00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:57,690
conversation plus we also speak

00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:57,690
too far interesting

00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:09,170
the u.s. to make for poor normal redneck

00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:11,990
white guys there is nothing yeah they're

00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:18,170
pulling we are making a whole bunch of

00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:19,610
spices not safe then that's right that's

00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:24,620
what the most interesting things that

00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:28,340
are happening out there sorry much good

00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,340
I hope so point was out it's possible to

00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,110
swing too fast so then I raised the

00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:37,420
issue of somebody actually starting an

00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:40,910
education program for poor room by room

00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:43,120
wondering and red neck my thighs yeah

00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:45,410
yeah they're making a patient in fact

00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,960
that's one of the things that the sexual

00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:50,540
community takes goes about gay sex order

00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,200
and safe sex and classical in any groups

00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:55,830
or that most that there's no good way

00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:01,020
for

00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:04,510
he re the most privileged in society

00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:06,610
postulates my guys to get involved in

00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:09,430
alternative sexuality stuff without

00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:13,300
coming across as creepy and everyone

00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:15,640
suddenly going no no no we need to take

00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:19,720
the safe safe space for the query will

00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,030
go away yeah that's problem yep and it's

00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:27,130
actually from our marginalizing evil

00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:29,410
fish as well nothin nobody was found

00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:33,360
shot in file and most are still

00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:33,360
developing history on volume I people

00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,890
but there's actually other drugs that

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:44,250
are given less person is for research

00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:44,250
because it's an issue that affects me

00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:51,990
yes this is an issue and yes that is a

00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:54,990
really awkward conversation to have yeah

00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:54,990
yeah

00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:02,750
I know so so something

00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,930
white male adult wrong because parents

00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,930
when

00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:09,819
boom Anna being transparent well that

00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:13,690
conversation

00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:15,820
and I actually like this

00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:16,640
it is what like but dude in public make

00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:23,510
sure

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:26,839
and why I have to be seated out for that

00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:28,920
it's a little bit more door don't know

00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:33,369
these expectations

00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:35,080
part of it is is how how to do that

00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:39,609
automation something that is already

00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:41,570
awful for these polymers so in a

00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:45,280
situation where

00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,280
and for a sport

00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,119
and like it was you know that it was

00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,119
like

00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,309
it wasn't a potential vital to you of

00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:56,330
the same time it was awful for you

00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:58,400
either make

00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,710
other side of that situation like you

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,750
don't want to hang that target of like

00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:06,020
Billy biggle desert you also don't want

00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:08,420

00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:11,030
habib ali sevenths like how can you be

00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,369
transparent about that whistling sound

00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:15,329
transparency

00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:18,519
yay abounds in transparency privacy hard

00:52:15,329 --> 00:52:22,569
hard or difficult case by case is the

00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:24,670
short version sometimes is enough for

00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:29,109
most people won't have knowing what's

00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:31,150
happened okay or almost nobody except

00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:33,430
people who were there during an incident

00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:37,450
or what happened others it was something

00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:41,259
i have an anatomist english case either

00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:42,999
okay evening as public no question their

response and advanced commences about

00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:47,140
liking our conversation without round

00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:49,619
but if something is having probably

00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,910
everyone knows that are giving question

00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:55,029
the other inspectors on is have a

00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:58,410
privately it's still working for the

00:52:55,029 --> 00:53:02,069
community to know that anything

00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:04,040
dealt with the consequences have been

00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:08,369
revisited

00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:10,619
modeled upon with fairies and angels we

00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:16,859
have to ask Marty other is just never

00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:18,599
enough smart industry but also that this

00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:21,920
is a thing that happens I'm ready to

00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,920
know so

00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:47,040
yeah exactly everybody else is like this

00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:50,190
suddenly a joint fight in among the

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,320
community whose then I really runs that

00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,480
okay and I wouldn't have done that you

00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,160

don't elected great by not talking about

00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:19,500
it the question is which is going to be

00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:23,550
worse having saved something publicly or

00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:25,470
having said nothing publicly but let's

00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,210
not original is not always a version

00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,460

00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:33,150

right right first communities right to

00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:46,480
know that something did happen in

00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:47,890
people's yeah and then the problem is of

00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,710
course that there are consequences the

00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:53,440
lucky notation insult or something like

00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:55,840
that the fact is the victim of assault

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,450

00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,450
consequences although speed regardless

00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:04,300
