good night everyone we are here to talk

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,240
about drupalcon Asia and do a debrief on

00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:22,140
what happened back in February in Mumbai

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,390
and yeah starting out for Triple Crown

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,430
Asia we had four main goals we really

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,890
wanted to unite the Indian community and

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,390
connect them with the world we wanted to

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,669
accelerate the project so we wanted to

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,130
bring Sprint's to the local community

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,110
and emphasize what they've already been

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,420
doing and and make sure that we

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,560
increased contribution from an already

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,270
top contributing country we also wanted

00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,050
to grow the talent pool and skill level

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:53,130
of Drupal developers in india and

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,900
connect talent with employers overall we

00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,630
ended up with just over a thousand

00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,579
conference attendees our summits were

00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,440
pretty popular we had 59 people at our

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,960
community summit 55 people at our

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,119
business summit 29 at our high red

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,299
Summit and 53 at the government summit

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,960
we also had 293 people participate in

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,109
trainings 150 of which were a

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:21,179
introductory beginners drupal training

00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:23,459
course that was free of charge overall

00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:25,759
the the demographics for drupalcon asia

00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,959
were pretty similar to other cons

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,639
especially when we look at the breakdown

00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,789
between beginner intermediate and

00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:34,560
advanced we obviously had quite a few

00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:37,289
developers there which is great we kind

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,229
of anticipated that we also had quite a

00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,549
lot of business level people using

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,020
Drupal so that was kind of exciting to

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,149
see attendees represented quite a few

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,069
different industries the strongest

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,709
represented industries were government

00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:55,069
education nonprofit tech services and

00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,069
media

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,090
overall the financials for Asia came in

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,010
about what we had anticipated we went

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,160
into this event anticipating a negative

00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:11,120
net income and we came fairly close to

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,650
what we had originally projected what's

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,050
interesting here you'll see is that we

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,850
have zero dollars in ticket revenue and

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,080
I'm sure that people are watching this

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,640
and thinking well I know I paid money

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,900
for my ticket to attend drupalcon Asia

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,390
the reason why we are showing zero

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,560
dollars on our balance sheet is the tax

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,200
director in India essentially iit bombay

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,320
was in charge of all of the ticket price

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,830
per ticket ticket revenue jet rescue me

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,620
ticket revenue collection and then with

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,570
that money they paid direct expenses for

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,730
the event so they paid that money

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,190
directly towards our catering bill so

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,890
our catering amount is lower in our next

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,980
slide with it which is expenses so it's

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,840
it's kind of a moot point so it doesn't

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,840
at ad revenue but it also takes away

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,830
expense so overall you'll see that we

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,459
had one hundred and twenty seven

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,019
thousand dollars in sponsorship revenue

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,459
which is great we had a goal of a

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,920
hundred thousand dollars so we were

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,510
really excited with how businesses

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,510
stepped up to support this conference

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,840
here is a breakdown of what we had

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,470
anticipated and where we ended up with

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,299
final ticket sales again we came up a

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,650
little bit short on our conference

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,450
tickets which was a little bit

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,519
disappointing but as I showed in the

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,280
previous slide we luckily went over on

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,860
our sponsorship revenue so that went a

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,380
long ways to making up that difference

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:40,489
in revenue here are the expenses for

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,019
drupalcon Asia one of the most

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,760
interesting things to me is that we have

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,930
a zero dollar internet bill and so I

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,600
thought I would put that in there even

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,739
though it was a non expense um one of

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,930
the great things about partnering with

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,519
iit bombay is that they have really

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,800
great internet that they provided to us

00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:00,280
free of charge

00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:04,250
a few things that we learned about

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,330
executing a drupalcon in asia were there

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,340
was a little bit difficult to operate

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,500
financially in India without having a

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,990
local business entity or agency

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,900
established so the triple Association

00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:18,290
does not have a you know a local Indian

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,239
outlet and so we had to find what was

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,950
the most you know optimal way for us to

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,690
operate there where we could collect

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,210
sponsorship revenue and collect ticket

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,440
revenue and pay expenses and try and do

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,090
that with limiting our tax liability

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,380
another thing that was interesting was

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,110
we ended up with more free tickets than

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,460
projected and again we ended up at about

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,930
the overall headcount that we'd hoped

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,870
for so we were right on that that

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,580
forecast but the breakdown came in a

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,980
little bit higher slanted towards free

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,840
tickets than paid tickets and that's

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,700
just one of those happy benefits of

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,530
having more sponsors so as a part of a

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,400
lot of sponsorships a lot of those

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,780
packages include free tickets we it was

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,419
a little bit difficult to operate in two

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,430
currencies and again the tax laws were

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,890
pretty complicated and had different

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,230
rules based on where media and

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,790
organization was located when they were

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,650
paying sponsorship dollars and so was a

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,050
little bit tricky to navigate although

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:16,160
we were able to come up with a plan to

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,620
do so we had quite a bit of marketing

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,510
activity around drupalcon Asia and the

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,520
activities that we did kind of fell into

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,770
a few categories we get a lot of content

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,750
marketing on our blog quite a bit of

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,330
social media marketing on Twitter and

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,850
Facebook we always communicate with our

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,430
attendees by email through mail chimp

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,380
and we partnered with quite a few local

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,230
camps and neat ups and local community

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,080
leaders we also partnered with a

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,660
marketing agency to who donated their

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,310
services to create some content for us

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,160
and if you see in the bottom right

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,720
corner of the slide we had a wonderful

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,520
photography team led by Michael cannon

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,740
who took some really really beautiful

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,750
photos of the event and if you haven't

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,669
checked out the Flickr page for

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,200
drupalcon Asia I would highly recommend

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,470
it there's a ton of really beautiful

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,250
photos from the event

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,230
I'm some of the results from the

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,640
marketing activities you know it was

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,990
really interesting to work with some

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,120
local marketing partners and local

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,620
marketing leads for the drupal

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,210
association it was a somewhat new or

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,680
unfamiliar audience although we've done

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,370
work with our friends in India for a

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,870
while to do things directly to them it

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,120
was just it was just a new way to

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,160
operate and we were happy to partner

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,800
with nice way who made content for our

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,360
blog they made a comic and a post per

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,330
month and the comics especially got a

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,940
lot of blog excuse me got a lot of buzz

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,960
and so we one of the things that we one

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,040
of the lessons we learn from working

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,080
with nice way was that if we do

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,250
something again in that way we want to

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,020
make sure that the partner knows our

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,160
community nuances so sometimes we had to

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,770
work with them a little bit on revising

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,440
some of the content but overall we were

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,390
super excited with what we were able to

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,510
get a nice way and the community really

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,890
responded well to it we also had quite a

00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,020
few volunteers help with social media

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,370
which was really helpful but a little

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,470
bit challenging at times just to make

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,419
sure that we had everybody firing in all

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,550
the right places so that was a different

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,280
challenge for staff but we want to make

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,930
sure that the volunteers feel free to

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,080
participate as much as they can and

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,050
often I find a lot of things to

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,160
volunteer with the pecans so we one of

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,260
the lessons that we learned here was

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,850
that it may be helpful to have social

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,380
media volunteers dedicated to just

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,140
social media rather than multiple

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,370
aspects of the con but that said we had

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,979
a really great experience partnering

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,690
with local community leads to to get the

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:36,070
content out across the social media

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,870
channels email is always a strong part

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,669
of communicating with drupalcon

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,640
attendees one thing that was really

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:44,320
interesting is that we emailed perform

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,750
or email marketing performs slightly

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,120
under our other cons but they did really

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,310
well compared to industry standards it

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,020
was interesting too that this email is

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,310
probably not the strongest way for us to

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,380
communicate with drupalcon Asia

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,780
attendees they may just not be as email

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,780
reliant as other con attendees

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,120
during during the con we definitely

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,760
found that Facebook photos were wildly

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,890
popular anything with photos were were

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,450
well-received because it was another way

00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,270
to help people kind of fall along from

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:20,690
home on Twitter our top performing

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,000
action had no our top horny link had no

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,160
action so we tried to do a Bollywood

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,590
dubsmash which didn't really seem to be

00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,450
pick up too much steam but we did have a

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,370
lot of action around our developer

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,040
contest various apps you can put on your

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,860
phone thank you sponsors and then also

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,030
words from local community members we

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,190
had really good and great engagement

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,780
metrics and a lot of that is due to you

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,630
know Mumbai such a really cool beautiful

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,400
city and people were really having a

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,610
great time exploring the city with other

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,040
community members and it was really

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,780
palpable and not only in person at the

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,660
event but all throughout social media to

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,000
see that energized community just really

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,620
being excited about drupalcon coming to

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,210
India one thing that we noted was that

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,230
there's just a huge opportunity for

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:11,450
growth there the community did a really

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,730
great job of amplifying any messages

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,320
that we put out there and we would not

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,820
have had anywhere near the success we

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,070
did about getting the word out about

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,190
drupalcon Asia without the help of

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,190
volunteers

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,550
so going forward we would put a stronger

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,260
emphasis on content that answered

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,870
questions we found that people reacted

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,190
really well to that we wanted to make

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,140
people feel like they're prepared for

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,690
triple con or at least we're at triple

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,460
con so trying to really bring that

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,980
experience home for people that may not

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,600
be able to attend in person the locally

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,730
content locally written content

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,920
performed really well and for future

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,210
third cons we want to focus on an

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
emphasis on what to expect when you

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,020
travel but the local communities like

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,460
what to expect when you get there and

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,440
also have stronger guidelines and

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,700
expectations for volunteers so that some

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,110
channels don't go away did people were

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,880
really excited about social media

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,310
engagement and especially during the con

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,930
it really reflected that one of our main

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,670
social media volunteers commented that

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,610
we had more Twitter activity for

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,230
drupalcon Asia than we do during

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,030
drupalcon North America and Europe at

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,860
times so people really showed up on

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,209
Twitter and showed their enthusiasm for

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,489
the event

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:24,079
we had a wonderful sponsor turn out like

00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:27,410
I mentioned earlier we blew through our

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,929
sponsorship goal which is great and we

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,910
had a really positive response from

00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:34,100
sponsors on site and after the event my

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,829
niece isn't the whole team so sometimes

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,989
up to 50 people for a company came which

00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,850
was great we had quite a few sponsors

00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:42,529
showing like local Flair and making sure

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,689
everybody knew about their company in

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,160
the community they came from the

00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:48,379
community driven messaging was very

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,489
prevalent it was really fun to see how

00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,720
people were trying to share whatever

00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:53,689
they could brick could from wherever

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,369
they were from and I think that we had

00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:57,679
definitely the most creative sponsored

00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:59,989
booths that I've seen at a drupalcon

00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,029
people really took this space that they

00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:03,859
were given and created some really fun

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,230
activities there was a lot of laughing

00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:09,139
and shouting and people having a great

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,699
time in the sponsorship area quite a few

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:13,129
were focused around photos we found out

00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:14,480
how excited attendees were to take

00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:17,029
pictures with each other and with all

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,379
the different fun props and and that

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,929
that carried through into social media

00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,730
and the nice thing is the sponsors kept

00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,079
a lot of the conversations going long

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,799
after the event so people were able to

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,509
find new teammates or new please they're

00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:31,989
find new partners and a new service

00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,989
providers

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,770
you

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,360
so these were our highest-rated are

00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46,300
seeking our highest attended sessions

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,339
katsu session on Drupal 8 theming was

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,779
the most popular session at 249 people

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,670
uses some of our awesome speakers again

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:58,029
there's a ton more pictures on flickr

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,939
and the top-ranked session went to Krell

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,040
so make your code do your job and I want

00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:05,709
to also remind people that at this point

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,610
we do have all of the sessions up on the

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:10,390
drupal associations YouTube page

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,270
so some of the things that went really

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,130
well in sessions attendees can tell when

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,660
speakers spend time preparing clean and

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,580
easy to understand slides so they really

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,190
liked when the slides were easily

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,570
digested they also appreciated speakers

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,220
who practiced and had engaging

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,410
presentations when they were

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,820
well-rehearsed and the top-rated

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,320
sessions were described as educational

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,600
entertaining and eye-opening so they

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,160
learned something new so a couple things

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,570
that we can improve for next time some

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,430
of the sessions had been presented at

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,500
camps around India before and were not

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,730
revised to be renew and exciting so

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,080
maybe they people had heard them before

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,660
if they've been to some of those local

00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,610
camps and there were varying levels of

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,380
expectations as to the skill levels so

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,820
beginner maybe need something different

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,320
to one person then to the other and

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,320
there was some confusion around that

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,670
we had a really great turnout for

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,530
Sprint's we had 350 people show up which

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,200
was fabulous I was over a third of the

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:04,040
conference and what was really fun to

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,480
see is we had 188 attendees attend the

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,950
first time sprinter workshop and learn

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,510
how to contribute and that goes directly

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,160
back to our original goal of helping

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,510
accelerate the project getting more

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,940
people to learn how to sprint and

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,140
contribute back to Drupal seventy-eight

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,520
percent of the tenis found the Sprint's

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,770
to be useful are very useful which is

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,780
really exciting and so many people

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,980
listed the live commit by web check is

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,450
one of their favorite moments of the

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,160
continent so we put that fun picture of

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,160
Angie down in the bottom jingle I commit

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,290
overall people were really satisfied

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,100
with the con we had a really high

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,240
favorability results in the survey some

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,389
of the things that were people were most

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,040
excited and most satisfied with where it

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,470
was the location which was not

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,600
surprising being that it was a fun new

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,610
location in India people were also

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,920
really thrilled with the opportunities

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,600
for networking not just with other local

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,649
Indian community members but also with

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,779
the international Drupal community

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,060
members that came to the event and

00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:04,269
people were really excited about the

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:06,850
speakers and session content another

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,070
great sign of the conference was how

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,470
many people really felt they got a good

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,089
value out of the conference so we had

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,470
about you know i think is about eighty

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,149
eight percent of people feel that they

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,100
got somewhat more or more much more

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:22,690
value than they expected out of the out

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,899
of drupal connie asia so the most

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,449
helpful aspects of the con people

00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:30,480
definitely loved the keynotes not only

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:33,730
dreams but especially Denise's speech

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,920
people really felt that they both were

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,230
kind of on point and great messages to

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:44,410
be heard again people really love

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:47,769
networking and the sessions and luckily

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,480
we found people responded well to the

00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:50,560
email newsletters that we sent out so

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,810
even though we may not have had as many

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,730
click throughs as we do with other cons

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,050
when people were reading those emails

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,050
they were fine and good and helpful

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,470
content so overall our net promoter

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:05,860
score for the event is 58 which is great

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:07,600
we I think about what we had for New

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,380
Orleans which is wonderful so we've got

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,380
a good bar set

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,280
a lot of really great feedback in the

00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,600
survey as far as like what favorite

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,980
favorite aspects of the con were so

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,690
people really loved the keynotes I heard

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,480
saw a lot of comments about I got to

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,010
meet trees it was so wonderful and so we

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,080
also heard a lot about people meeting

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,240
other people in meeting people in person

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,580
whom they've only interacted with on IRC

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,290
or drupal.org again a lot of people

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,910
really love the live commit by web chick

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,250
so that was a highlight of sprints and

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,900
the pre know the flash mob all the fun

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,570
things that happened over in the the

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,510
plenary room we asked what would you

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,660
like more of that drupalcon the things

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,610
that we heard most were live demos more

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,650
mentored course for more mentors prints

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,900
and a longer conference people wanted

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,850
more days someone even suggested we make

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,580
it a 10 day conference which to me

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:01,030
sounds very very long I appreciate that

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,410
people want more Drupal God so in

00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,360
summary the conference was really a

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,220
community event with tons of volunteers

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,310
from all over the country and all over

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,570
the world I this event absolutely would

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,190
not have happened without the help and

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,750
support of so many volunteers

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,140
particularly from the local Mumbai

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,940
community people were really really

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,150
thrilled to meet other community members

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,140
face-to-face that was evident when you

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,180
were there and people were getting all

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,280
excited to say oh I think I see Morton

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,620
Nura I'm gonna go talk to to you know

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,970
Hussein or whoever they could see and so

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,280
that was really fun to see people making

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,310
those connections live that they often

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,630
make online with so many first-time

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,070
attendees there was an excited and

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,320
infectious attitude about making a

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,770
difference in open source we had quite a

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,470
few first time drupalcon attendees and

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:50,200
and it was really really fun to see

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,030
people come to their first con and see

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,960
how big the Drupal community is and what

00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:58,210
all there is to do with in open source

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,500
there was for us in an event production

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,810
standpoint there were some challenges to

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,160
planning that could have been managed

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,310
differently if we do another event in

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,709
India the Indian community is very

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,990
hungry for more Drupal cons and we came

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,640
away with a lot of good takeaways as far

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,360
as ways we can make the process smoother

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,439
neck in the future so going forward one

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,589
thing we want to reiterate is how

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,540
important India is on making an impact

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,860
in Drupal especially at drupalcon so

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,559
India is obviously one of the top

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,799
contributors

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,240
to triple the project and the code but

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,249
for drupalcon new orleans in he was the

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,899
second country as far as session

00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:34,730
submissions go second only to the United

00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:37,370
States so that was really fabulous to

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:40,009
see the impact that that drupalcon Asia

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,389
had on people you know submitting their

00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:45,289
ideas of submitting their topics and

00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:46,970
sessions to drupalcon the strip akan can

00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,710
help to energize the local community

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,269
bringing recognition to the

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,980
accomplishments they are making and

00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,779
creating some buzz around giving back

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,249
that is continuing with more local

00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,799
activities and new comers to Drupal

00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:59,509
we've heard of a lot of more like new

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,980
community meet ups or camps that are

00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:03,320
planned in the next year or so and

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,210
that's just really thrilling to see kind

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,379
of the ripple effect of having a large

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,970
event in India if we were to do another

00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,259
triple con in india i think the

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,659
financial model would maybe need a

00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,129
little bit of adjustment making sure

00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,740
that the ticket prices are in line with

00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:20,929
what the market can afford and that also

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,690
the sponsorship model matches what the

00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,919
sponsors needs are and making sure that

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,200
there's a good balance between the two

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:31,369
so that we can have a financially

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:35,480
healthy event so let me see if there's

00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:36,919
any questions online and it looks like

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,740
there are not so i must have done a very

00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,419
good job of covering all the bases but

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,889
that said if you have any questions if

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:44,679
you're watching this online we will

00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:47,330
