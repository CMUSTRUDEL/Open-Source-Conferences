any Masucci grrrrrr I'm the technical

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,150
team lead in aquia to give some

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,059
background about me educationally I'm a

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,099
MBA in finance and marketing but then I

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,830
came in to whitey i started doing

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,699
development PHP development and I have

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,210
been doing PHP for the past 13 14 years

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,609
now I have never bought a book in PHP

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,269
never learn PHP from any training issue

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:35,370
but and I have been in the Drupal space

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:38,790
since rupal 4.6 and again never brought

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,680
a book pushed into it at this moment I

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,290
if I look at acquire certifications for

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,620
example I am a grandmaster and currently

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,270
and I have a I am leading a team I have

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,710
been managing projects i am a technical

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,510
architect so these are the roads that i

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,520
have been playing one of the rules while

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,980
doing all this is because aquia is a

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,899
u.s. come us-based company and he

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,320
started 10 years back but we started in

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,030
india about three years back and we have

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,860
been growing like crazy i joined aqua

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,810
about one and a half years back and

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,360
there was just six people in the company

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,380
at that time at this moment we are 25

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,700
plus and the plan is to increase is

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:23,670
twofold within this year so as you can

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,810
imagine hiring has been our number one

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,700
priority and while we are trying to hire

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,720
we have been facing a lot of challenges

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,700
and this is one of the sums of what I

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,880
have experienced in the past one and a

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,360
half year just to get in understanding

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,200
of my audience can you just tell me a

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,200
bit about yourselves

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,870
alright and how big is your 25 people

00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,500
right so somewhere on what aquia India

00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,500
is essentially precise I'm working

00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,570
stop

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:11,330
all right others who are owning a

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,670
company who are involved in talent

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:20,510
hiding who all here are involved in

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:28,070
hiding yeah I think that's why you're

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:30,050
here all right so as as we just said why

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,760
are we here what are we discussing my

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:37,580
size don't have anything so I don't

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:41,530
think you'd be able to write sure all

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:44,000
right so before i start with the

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,090
challenges we are facing let me tell me

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,450
let you let me tell you a bit about my

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,700
experience as i told you i was i am an

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,160
mba finance and marketing and i got a

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,410
placement job placement as in they came

00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,410
to the campus and they hired me and I

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,150
was I was an executive assistant in a

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,280
management service in a cement

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,830
management services company which is

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,920
like nowhere near I t know where he

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,750
righty I was in exactly this sustained I

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,750
was supposed to be doing business

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,519
management kind of stuff etc etc but

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,690
within one year when in a half year of

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:24,950
Germany I was sort of pushed into ID my

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,780
boss the he was the ED of the executive

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,260
director of the company at that time he

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,180
was the one who it just happened that

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,600
our IT managers they were two marriages

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,390
they just quit it's a 350 strong company

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,160
they those two people just quit we had

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,709
our internal service and there was

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,170
nobody to take care of them the person

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:48,100
my boss who was handling all this he was

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:51,920
in the US so and I am talking about

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,959
2,000 or 90 99 maybe and he just ping me

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,450
on yahoo I am because that's what was

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,760
prevalent at that time and he just bring

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,370
me all right you need to reboot the

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,040
server Italy I don't know what needs to

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,660
be done I don't know how to do it and he

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,989
was like okay I'll be saying you come on

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,590
you just copy paste copy paste and

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:14,780
that's how i got into service then he

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,729
and me both of us single-handedly

00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,320
decided all right let's make an internet

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,720
for the company

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,230
that's when I got into PHP i started PHP

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,920
in PHP 3 where extension used to be dot

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:30,290
PHP 3 and oops was just too oops I

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,650
dropped us and not object oriented

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:38,900
programming think so that's where I

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:41,150
started Rushton remember once heels he

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:46,430
was in the company he was around but I

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:49,220
just removed I just deleted the content

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,410
of one whole department on the server

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,410
and the Department of Finance and

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:58,850
Accounting just took so he would just

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,770
imagine the and he and I i I'm always in

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,200
early riser IDs office early used to

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,500
come a bit late and i went i sorry i

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,120
just did this all right what did you do

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,700
so he sat me down because i was like all

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,160
hyper i don't know what to do they said

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,380
okay what did you do add it justice very

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,860
cool d Tommy let's do a backup restore

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,140
and that's how I learned that's how I

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,480
learned even though I was not an intern

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,880
and what we are talking about here is an

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,790
internship program essentially but what

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,850
I am trying to say here is that if you

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:36,320
have a mentor who invest his time in you

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:38,420
that is when your association with that

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:44,140
organization with that mentor with the

00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:46,940
boys boss actually grows really bad so

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,180
we just talked about so many people here

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,740
who are into hi who are into do behind

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,520
the new beaten the new people who are

00:05:51,740 --> 00:06:00,760
coming can I just have some idea of what

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,760
roles you are in for me bro manatee

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:13,870
okay all right and you are involuntary

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:17,670
unsure yeah for the new digital and

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,670
physical setting up you two

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:27,569
so let's switch a bit to the Indian

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,650
Indians scenario but I am sure you guys

00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:33,659
also face the same challenges you guys

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,610
you all of you are involved in hiring

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,990
and you have been trying to hire for the

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,060
past let's say one year or something

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:45,740
what are the biggest challenges that you

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,740
see in the community today anything

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,809
communication skills yes but I think the

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,460
biggest concern is a technical the

00:06:52,809 --> 00:07:01,569
standard that we want for technical

00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:03,960
expertise is not there I know this I

00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:06,550
will do this and not do anything else

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,680
anything i would like to be just enough

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:16,680
of a serious a liar the narrow focus

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,680
rather than getting a broader focus yep

00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:28,719
I'm sorry I didn't get it can you a

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:38,259
rockstar developer you all right you

00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:41,620
really find them you have to have many

00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:49,839
other there are only few rock stars in

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:55,240
the community that is the problem it's

00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:57,219
not a bit rope it is everybody has their

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,620
own concerns people don't join aquia as

00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:01,779
well even though in the Drupal community

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,330
aquia we I would consider a career to be

00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:07,870
a higher preference level than others

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,789
but people have their own reasons why

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,129
they don't want to join for example for

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,709
us one of the reasons we have lost a lot

00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,930
of people because we are located in

00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,139
delhi and we are not very open to a

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,490
remote culture and so people don't want

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,439
to roll okay relocate they cannot

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,459
relocate way we have the they are there

00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:30,610
and that's perfectly okay so the biggest

00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:33,430
issue as we said is technical talent and

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,769
then the aptitude stuff Xizor attitude

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,349
is something else that yes you can try

00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:39,819
to you know and there's also something

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,769
technical talent is also something you

00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:45,190
can train them but then you have to

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:48,269
train them right and I think the one of

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,069
the biggest reasons behind all that is

00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:53,949
if i look at the educational in speedos

00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:55,899
today do you not know of any educational

00:08:53,949 --> 00:09:00,610
institute any college which has grupal

00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:03,370
as its curriculum i know one sim Isis in

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,930
pune pune and that too because the

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,139
teacher they are the professor who's

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:11,500
owning that particular IT thing he is a

00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:14,290
very pro two per person so he has one

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,870
semester one thing which is a Drupal

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,630
course just a small cause but at least

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,939
he is giving the their students a push

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,819
towards tuple but other than that forget

00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:28,720
about rupal we don't have PHP in the

00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:31,269
curriculum so people do have that all

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,930
right I learned dotnet I have learned BB

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:37,569
i go there because i have learnt c++

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,290
i'll go there they don't have that kind

00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:44,019
of inclination to go towards an

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:47,079
open-source thing and i mean if i look

00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:49,689
at some of the lips if I will if I don't

00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:52,779
include people who are passionate in

00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:55,930
trying to do something new if they are

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:57,490
not they will just teach they just learn

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,279
what is being taught in the class and

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,949
that's it they're done I have some

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,899
examples sitting right here who in the

00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,850
college in the school decided to just

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,699
open the computer apart into what not

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,399
with it but there are others who don't

00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:14,680
even care they just want to pass the

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,110
exams and that's it and when you have

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,569
such a mentality getting Drupal talent

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,029
out of the education and shoes just out

00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:23,350
of the box it's just not possible I

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:28,059
think that is one of the biggest

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:31,029
problems that we have right also if I

00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:33,040
look at the big training institutes that

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:34,660
are available the biggest trading in

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,269
stood that comes to my mind in terms of

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,579
Indian context again is an ID they don't

00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:42,880
have a Drupal curriculum they don't know

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:45,040
about Drupal they have a PHP curriculum

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,160
that is but that is offered in just some

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,410
centers just some centers but if you go

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,170
for dotted yes I've got this many color

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,839
balance this many courses if you have vb

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,850
+ vb and whatnot you have loads of

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,100
critical and severe levels but when it

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,519
comes to open those things like PHP and

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,230
rupal no there's nothing and that is

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,560
that in some ways does Oh

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,190
no not again because we have issues like

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,560
this the problem that we guys face as

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,630
people who try to hire is a typical

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,030
chicken and eggs thing we not we need

00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,580
experienced people but way to experience

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,480
people come from we don't have

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,480
experienced people

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,330
so I mean as I said we need fresh we

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,149
don't need facials but fetches how do

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,000
they do they gain experience unless and

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:46,660
until you know we teach them or somebody

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,630
teaches them that is the problem the

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,550
solution I would not say it's a one-stop

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,560
solution but one of the possible

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,120
solutions is probably internship and

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,360
that is what we are here to talk about

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,880
the possible solution is internship so

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,910
that we hire people who have some spark

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,100
and we try to train them in Drupal and

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,290
then try to see whether they suit our

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,160
needs and they also see whether this

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:16,390
company Susur needs and you know try to

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:20,100
you know mum merge them but then we talk

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,779
of internships what makes an internship

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,540
useful what makes an internship powerful

00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:28,959
before I go into that just the question

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,870
in your career in your career the Spirit

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,490
has there been one person who has been

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,980
instrumental in your growth in in

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,440
guiding you and I am sure each and every

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,350
one of you has that one person who was

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:45,040
who guided you into the right spot into

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,740
the right direction right and once you

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,899
have that kind of a person you try to

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,770
stick to that person to the organization

00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:57,870
that person belongs so having one person

00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:01,050
who is guiding you normally technically

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,310
technical guidance is important yes but

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,310
overall mentoring is really really

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:09,100
important that's what makes internship

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,430
bang on that's what makes internship

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,480
useful enough without that kind of

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:20,820
investment without that kind of a thing

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,820
internships don't really matter

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:30,129
but what exactly I mean the question is

00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:33,189
if I look at from the interns point of

00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:35,079
view we have 1x intern here sitting we

00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:37,029
have a one current interns they are

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,639
sitting here i am sure you are also

00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:41,110
sitting here for from the students

00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:46,899
perspective and not the hiring

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:51,399
perspective these are the what what does

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:55,629
internship have in in for you so Carrie

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,970
or exploding exploration so that you you

00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,470
don't have to go into that field but it

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,809
means you're able to get into field

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,399
experience it firsthand and then you

00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,040
figure out and then you decide whether

00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,110
this is right for me or not because at

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,149
times from the outside some field looks

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,679
very challenging very interesting but

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,019
once you are into it then you realize

00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,629
okay this is not for me it doesn't it

00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:20,470
doesn't excite me that is the biggest

00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:23,170
thing an internship can offer you gain

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:26,199
industry knowledge accumulate evidence

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:30,329
of your abilities critical professional

00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,329
contacts that's really really important

00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:35,800
confidence boost possibly lad outlined a

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,720
full time job if the company if the

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,720
organization's likes you as an intern

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,699
yes they would want to give you a job

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,439
but they might not want to give you a

00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:47,019
job as well it depends entirely on you

00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:48,759
and of course is you may enhance mins so

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,550
in your resume if you like if I have

00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:59,740
done internship with ABC it has a weight

00:14:51,550 --> 00:15:03,370
age right but if we if we talk loosely

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,759
we a lot of things are called internship

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,089
well if I ask any of you what do you

00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,379
mean by internship can anyone answer

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,269
what what is internship you are trying

00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:16,110
to look for internship program what you

00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,110
feel is internship

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,100
he is already working on it it gives us

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,860
an inside of how the corporate world is

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:30,610
actually working dynamics of people with

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,610
money okay anybody else

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:40,900
yeah get real-time hands-on projects yes

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:43,090
or maybe no because it's as a project

00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,490
manager I would not probably not put an

00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,880
intern on a full tank project just like

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:52,840
that yes as a shadow yes as a shadow

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,540
that's what exactly so you are part of

00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,120
the project but maybe not really doing

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:01,480
but just overseeing things and seeing

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:07,980
how things work you want to say

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:11,560
something you just my internship is

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,200
pressure then we get an exposure how

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,370
they just want to maybe get an exposure

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,250
of where we live and we also we get an

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:25,690
opportunity to improve ourselves and get

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,730
corporate rate very long answer too much

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:32,700
too much in the hunt the typical of

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:35,230
favor all right let me give you the

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,310
official one of the official definitions

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,530
of internship and of any official or

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,110
formal program to provide practical

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:47,140
experience for beginners in an

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,670
occupation or profession I think that

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,930
pretty much summarizes what internship

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:55,600
is it might not be exactly for all

00:16:52,930 --> 00:17:00,070
freshers when a person is friend to

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,690
switch the field of their work that is

00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,480
also one point where they might want to

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,620
row internships I was in IT I don't want

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,260
to row ID now I don't want to do

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:10,750
something else I might want to up so

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,600
it's not only for students but it is for

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,589
everybody who's new to the field that is

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,870
where an internship is really required

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:23,709
and internship can be paid or unpaid it

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,150
can be part-time full-time right in

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,580
terms maybe college or university

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,740
graduates as the freshers that as you

00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,440
mentioned but it can be full-time grown

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:37,750
up at us both graduate adults who decide

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,940
to switch then you know it's a

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,040
structured work experience essentially

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,450
and it should if you are talking about

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,909
the student it should enhance

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,639
of the students field of study should

00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:51,039
enhance his term grade or somehow it

00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:52,600
should be enhancing the his field of

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,429
study so that he gained something out of

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,720
internship that is the whole point of

00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:01,600
getting an internship but I think the

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,029
biggest the strongest point when I have

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,190
to define internship is that it should

00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:11,980
be an experience where the intern is

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:14,740
mentored by a professional that is the

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,889
biggest and most important thing unless

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,289
and until there is mentorship by a

00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:23,559
professional if we just hire an intern

00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:27,399
and let him lose as an often it will not

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:29,710
help so a professional mentorship in an

00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:32,039
internship program is the most important

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,360
thing whether it's a paid or an unpaid

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,240
scenario whether it's a newbie whether

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,740
it's a postgraduate graduated her to as

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,549
a ten years of experience it does not

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:45,130
matter it has to be a mentor program

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:51,210
unless Anton's mentor it should it will

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:53,919
not have any any weight age at all so

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,049
internship all the definitions whatever

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,720
we talked about all those true but the

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:00,970
key point is thus active mentorship

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,460
unless I until we have active mentorship

00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,460
we are not able to do anything

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:21,380
so a minute yeah sorry we just talked

00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:24,650
about how internship is useful for the

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,910
interns now we can talk about how

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:30,650
internship is useful for the

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:33,020
organization these are I mean how many

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:36,710
of you have actually hired interns have

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:39,890
had interns in the account and I'm sure

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:42,830
whatever good whatever result you wanted

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,390
out of it is listed out here what was

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:51,559
the biggest thing that came to your mind

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:53,330
when you were hiring an intern yeah find

00:19:51,559 --> 00:20:02,600
here employs that's probably the topmost

00:19:53,330 --> 00:20:05,360
thing for you is that others Tess Tyler

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,980
darling yes that's pretty much find

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,640
future employees and Tesla retiring is

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,640
pretty much the same

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:18,290
young and on and yes yeah yeah if you

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,540
look at the team which has like all of

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,180
them are five years five year old

00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,660
developers the perspective that an

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,570
intern Briggs is really unique why can

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:32,260
we do this like this and mothers and

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,260
that's really important

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,970
some people do talk about this as well

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:42,010
even though I put this here i am i'm

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,020
sure i'm not a supporter a supporter of

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,030
this because they think that okay

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,760
internship is to take advantage of

00:20:46,030 --> 00:21:07,060
low-cost labor so i have an intern go

00:20:48,760 --> 00:21:10,810
and bring coffee for me so she totally

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:13,360
agree totally early and i think the last

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,280
point is very relevant as well we don't

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,040
really think of the last point but it's

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,360
really relevant so for example i have an

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,590
intern who's been working for him for

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,500
the past three months six months

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,240
whatever and he's from a great college

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,220
which has a great tiring but i have not

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,340
been able to see the talent but when he

00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,720
goes back there you know he says okay

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,220
this company is really great to work

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,650
with this has a really really great

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,400
culture and that is free advertising for

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:41,700
you literally word of mouth well if

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,930
you're looking at an advertising

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,930
advertisement you will not feel like

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,370
okay i want to buy this product but the

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,040
moment somebody says okay i have used

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,370
this i love it yes you might want to try

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:58,540
it out so this last part is also very

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,880
very important so these are the

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,670
advantage this advantages that almost

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,580
every one of us can think about but

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:09,430
there are so many intrinsic advantages

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:12,640
like that are not written here again

00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,310
coming back to my example I was not

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,720
having done yes but because of the fact

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:21,940
that I was like so invested in so i was

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,300
i was given so much of mentorship by

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,850
somebody i was being I was an intern in

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:31,060
the field of IIT totally because I was

00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:34,060
not praying for IT so I might be a

00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,770
full-time employee but as if i look at

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,840
it culturally and if I located

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,730
technically I was actually an intern

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,280
because I was being groomed to become an

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:46,559
IT manager or or whatever PHP developer

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,090
or whatever I I do remember when I said

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,950
if you remember I just said that we

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,669
decided to build brayer to build an

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,960
intranet for the company just two people

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:58,409
actually built an intranet for the

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,659
company in less than a month and that

00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:04,100
was being run by and that was being used

00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:08,429
by 350 people right from the word go

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:11,610
internet which did not have any CMS core

00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:14,340
PHP code a database calls etc etc and we

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:18,899
built an infinite because of the fact

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,610
that I was so invested I it may I made

00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:23,519
sure that I have a curtain commitment I

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:27,090
have to do it after that we didn't stop

00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:30,389
there almost single-handedly I had made

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,909
a project management system for them and

00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:35,309
project management system for a cement

00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:38,909
company that has been in the business

00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:42,029
for since nineteen sixty seven so you

00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:45,960
can and again 250 people wherein they

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:49,230
have projects tasks time slots timesheet

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,019
entries every thing and that thing I

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,509
mean I love last talked to them about

00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,809
six seven years back and it was still

00:23:54,509 --> 00:24:00,419
running core PHP nothing like that and

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:02,999
it was still running a postgresql I

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,129
didn't know my skills at that time so he

00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:06,929
decided let's do PDS killers like okay

00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:10,230
let's do PG spill I have to learn either

00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:12,779
of them so I just did that even though I

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,019
silo get back at him and like over it i

00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:19,230
right but the the level of you know

00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:21,450
commitment that an intern has because of

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:26,940
the fact that that person is so invested

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:30,149
in you that's very high I work for that

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,249
organization for almost eight years but

00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:33,990
and I would not have left that I would

00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:35,970
have might I might have been still in

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,740
that organization but I had some

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,210
personal issues I got really sick I

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,369
couldn't travel to the office and exact

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,320
exocrine that was the reason I left that

00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:47,700
otherwise I would still have been there

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:51,990
because of the fact that yes people had

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:55,649
that investment in me so again you know

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,290
the if you if you train and in turn

00:24:55,649 --> 00:25:01,260
properly if you invest in the in

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:04,380
turn properly if you make sure that he

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,860
his growth path is good enough that

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,200
person becomes part of your DNA his his

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,540
growth is from within rather than you

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,990
know and and that kind of a person will

00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:18,720
in all the cases every each and every

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:21,360
case will perform better than a person

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,760
who is getting a paycheck to get his job

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,700
done because that person has their

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,450
social connect with you and that is what

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:35,450
so organizations have an intern program

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:38,850
yes all this is very good but an

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:42,060
internship program almost always if it

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:45,120
is successful almost always guaranteed

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:47,430
committed committed employees I have

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,560
seen a lot of cases where we started

00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,960
with an intern and he was he or she

00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,360
would be in the organization for a very

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,600
long time as compared to others even if

00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,890
even if the company or the industry is a

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,900
height transition industry do you guys

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,540
agree with me i don't know i don't want

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:11,160
this to be a one-way thing any comments

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:15,090
any pretty 16 years ago and you've been

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:18,020
in 20 awesome you can vouch for that

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,020
totally awesome

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,899
no son back

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,780
yes because nowadays instead of like

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:39,750
until do a solution I do I don't

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:43,320
ratification awesome yeah yeah I agree

00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:46,170
to your thing but again it it depends on

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,240
what motivates the person it again if I

00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,160
talk about my example I was in that

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,220
company for eight years and within that

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,980
a eight years I did get a lot of good

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,320
office which were paying much more than

00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,970
what abou I would I was being paid but

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,190
because I was comfortable in that come

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:05,310
here not only comfortable I was valued

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:08,490
in that company I did not think of a

00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:11,840
switch you know I mean there are people

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,840
who are driven by money i would

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,510
definitely got it done no I want to make

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,820
sure that yes there as I said there are

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,950
people who are actually turned on by

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,730
money let us say let's put it this way

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:32,430
but not all and down the line they

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,590
people do realize that money is not I

00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,420
would not stay in a company because it's

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,100
offering me much more money I will stay

00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,990
in the company because I like working

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,670
there or I like the environment there I

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,400
mean those things are much more in what

00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,260
maybe that's just me but i have i have

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,730
worked with the current generation as we

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,320
as you just put in the current

00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,890
generation i am part of the older

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,120
generation sadly but yeah i have worked

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:58,260
with the current generation we have

00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,150
people here who I mean they they they

00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,120
are smart enough to understand it yes

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:05,970
money is important but you have to think

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,230
about other things as well I I don't

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,360
understand the point that you are trying

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:17,070
to make here that yes I trained a person

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:20,550
I'd spend yes yes that's the service

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:24,750
that is present always you hire a person

00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:26,330
you even buy their notice period out and

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:31,080
that person leaves in three months

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:34,790
happens always right so that's a risk

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,790
you have to be willing to take

00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:49,610
a fresh a fresher equate recruit with a

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:52,520
fresh or what do you mean by flesh then

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:56,540
again even if it's a fresher recruit you

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:59,179
will have to train that person right the

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,190
internship in some ways is better in

00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:03,650
that case because you have an obligation

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:06,320
with that person for a certain period of

00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:09,140
time and if that person doesn't suit you

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,850
and if and if that person feels that the

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,309
company doesn't suit me it's both ways

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,350
if they don't sue do there is no all

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:17,690
right there is okay this is the end of

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,660
six month internship this is the end of

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,940
six months I do not need to hire you but

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:26,780
if you have hired a recruit a fresher

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,970
you recruited a fresher now you have you

00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,260
have a lot of other things you have all

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,669
the benefits that you have to give him

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,200
you have if if you have a gnome

00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,690
desperate kind of a thing you can't just

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,830
fire them after six months because then

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,530
you have to give him the notice period

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,270
thing as well so it's um it's you know

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,860
the kind of investment in terms of

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,640
training is similar in both the cases

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:49,490
but the contractual obligation is lesser

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,440
in terms of internship because the

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,690
person who is coming as an intern knows

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,490
exactly like okay I'm an intern for six

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,350
months I have to learn in this six

00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,559
months I have to perform well and only

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:03,080
then I will be given a full-time status

00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,960
only then I will be hired but a freshman

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,020
record he knows oh yes I am hired now

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,370
that's what happens in placements TCS

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,140
maybe they pro I don't know who the

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,110
products like all right go to a college

00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,940
higher 25 people yes let's go that's

00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,520
what happens but if we talk about

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,549
smaller organizations like yours like

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:26,090
ours in India we cannot do that because

00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:29,480
we don't have the training you know

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:32,419
setups Odysseus has a training who are

00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,150
full huge training a center in mysore in

00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:37,809
chennai as well we don't have that and

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,809
we can't afford that

00:30:38,669 --> 00:31:34,019
I don't like you yeah yes there is there

00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:35,759
are both space but then in some ways it

00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:38,279
is very comparable to an internship

00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,019
because again the person who's remind

00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,509
knows that I am on probation for six

00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:44,970
months and unless until I perform well I

00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:47,369
learn well I demonstrate my capabilities

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,830
I will not be able to do that so that

00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:53,220
inter in some terms is comparable to

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,840
internship because again anyways if you

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,999
are hiring an intern you have to train

00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,679
them you have to put in that investment

00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,909
in any case whether you are hiring as an

00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,129
intern you whether you are heading as a

00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:06,629
full term on probation or no probation

00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:10,230
etc so investment is the same may be

00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:11,730
slightly less or no but probation yes if

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,609
you have a probationary period you have

00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,350
that kind of a clear-cut endpoint that

00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:18,239
yes this is the point till where you

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,440
have to demonstrate maybe it's similar

00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:21,440
to internship in some

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:29,920
no as an intern my one of my interns are

00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:33,610
sitting right here top it talk to him

00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:38,680
about pressure pressure like if I higher

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:41,350
pressure and there is a very period so

00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,270
even an intern who is on internal again

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,610
it's sort of a probationary prepare it

00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:48,730
for that in turn as well if he's an

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:50,980
intern for six months he knows what what

00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:54,010
intern she gives gives both the parties

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:57,070
is a flexibility maybe my intern things

00:32:54,010 --> 00:33:01,000
that yes this is not for me then that is

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:03,460
the best way to to test right you know

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,230
that yes this is maybe this is if you

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,170
had a fresh show you real the fresher

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:10,210
doesn't really know let's take let's

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:13,570
talk about the intern in the Indian

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,970
scenario you have into colleges and you

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:19,170
were part of a college ones placement

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:22,240
day first day how many people apply

00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:24,070
everybody irrespective of what is the

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,140
company what is the job description what

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,960
is the damn road I do not get and the

00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:31,840
supplying because I want a job am i

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,770
right nobody cares on what the job

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,480
description is so as a company you hired

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,820
a person on the first day of placement

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,700
do you think that that person is a right

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,320
fit for you and whether that person know

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,530
that this job is the right fit for me

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,710
that is what internship allows you to

00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,710
have

00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,110
from a student's point of view i will

00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,790
reply as an intern professor with

00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,430
photoshop we just go and we like have

00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,500
fun we learn we are funny at all is

00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:04,740
actually honestly speaking yes the six

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,810
month we have no guarantee or you know a

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,120
couple paying that you'll you'll be

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:12,570
hired after six months those six funds

00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:16,290
get it only live there and we know try

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:19,169
to learn as much as possible yeah 61

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,840
yeah so it's like a beneficiary for both

00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:26,700
I was like the organizers or these comfy

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:31,080
and we threw nothing thank you helps to

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:33,179
have a different perspective as well any

00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,260
anything else any anything else you guys

00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,260
might have yep

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,800
yes

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:50,690
when it

00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,690
prerequisites for are we coming to that

00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,090
we ever heard of a such a story here I

00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,890
am a success story of thought of

00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,080
internship I have a success story

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,060
sitting right there and this guy will

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,040
hide in an intern fresh out of the

00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,490
college and now he's into ensuring of

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,050
aquia and he is a very bright guy but we

00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,850
do I have horror stories as well does

00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,540
anybody have a horror story what is the

00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:17,460
worst thing that your boss or your

00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:20,040
mentor asked you to do both possible

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,800
thing fetch my tracking how you saying

00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:28,320
devil the devil wears prada anybody has

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,970
seen that movie I'm sure that a woman

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,890
would have seen that I was sure none of

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,650
the guys would have dreamed that but a

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:38,160
girl would have seen that so that's

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:40,680
that's the first or a for sure so i have

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,750
seen in turns being told okay go and

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,840
fetch coffee go and go do put a sax

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:48,330
photocopies then fetch my go and fetch

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,000
my laundry we don't have that much

00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:57,240
laundry facing in india mighty up I've

00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:00,210
seen that so before we go to what you

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,360
were saying just what internship is not

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:07,350
it's not a go for position internship is

00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:10,740
not for fetch this and fetch that and do

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,840
data entry it's not for that it's not a

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,660
guarantee job offer from both ends I

00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,490
mean if the if the organization likes

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,690
the intern it's not necessarily that he

00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:24,780
that guy min joined and vice versa it's

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:28,710
not for free labor it's not for clerical

00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,060
or data entry jobs don't think it's a

00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,670
different matter we do give some data

00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,340
entry jobs to our interns but bend the

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:38,040
project demands but it's essentially

00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,900
it's not a clerical job thing that we

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,840
have hired somebody who's a low costing

00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:46,560
low-cost person so let's go ahead and

00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,670
you know and this is a take away from

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,360
what I had been saying earlier

00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,130
mentorship internship will not be an

00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,400
unguided

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,620
an unsupervised experience it cannot be

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,500
that is one of the biggest things that

00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,870
we have to stick with it cannot be a nun

00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,390
guiding thing you can't hire an ill done

00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:12,170
and then leave him often in the company

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:14,810
you just be there I just read a quote

00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,520
somewhere we said internship is a debut

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,950
performance and not a dress she herself

00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,250
so that is something that the interns

00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:24,080
here should understand that you have to

00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,360
be committed to it don't think of it as

00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,240
a ref dress for yourself think of it

00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,530
more as a your debut performance do you

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,200
understand the difference between the

00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:37,880
two do you understand the difference

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:40,430
between the two alright so again from

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,470
the interns point of view the purpose of

00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,960
internship right Hugh right very rightly

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:47,870
said it's not the purpose is not to make

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,390
money the purpose is to learn as much as

00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:52,550
you can to assimilate the culture as you

00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:55,010
much as you can and then go ahead and

00:37:52,550 --> 00:38:02,740
decide on what you do what you want to

00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:06,050
do in your in the rest of your life now

00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:08,630
yes we should have an internship I just

00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,340
hope that my this talk of mine has

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,130
influenced and some of the people who

00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,970
have an internship program but how to be

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:18,980
real internship just you can just you

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:21,440
can't just go ahead and hire somebody as

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,720
an intern and be happy with it that's

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,810
not an internship program there are a

00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,880
few prerequisites the first one gain

00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:35,510
business white packing what I mean by

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,360
this is take for example our company yes

00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:42,130
aqua ideas in entity but we do have our

00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:46,220
bosses who are in US unless and until

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:49,730
each one of the layers right from the

00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:52,960
CEO to the actual manager unless and in

00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:55,820
all of them agreed that yes we want to

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,620
hire an intern yes we want to go ahead

00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,760
with the internship program the

00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,760
internship program will not be

00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,680
successful the reasons behind that is

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,089
top the topmost levels

00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,329
they have to look at the financial part

00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:11,369
of it right the lower levels though I

00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:13,849
would not say the lower levels the

00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:18,089
supervised the level is a mentor levels

00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:20,520
they have to be ready to invest that

00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,180
amount of time that amount of focus on

00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,640
that person unless until they are ready

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:30,030
internship with not succeed the

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,270
financial aspect of it is also is also

00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,609
on a different way I as the person as I

00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,369
as a supervisor I as a mentor have been

00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:42,359
assigned an intern and I have been told

00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:44,760
to and to mentor a person but I have a

00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:47,490
project hundred percent can I do that I

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,730
will not be able to I might try to do

00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,859
that if I'm if I'm worrying about the

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,569
outcome of that internship but I will

00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:57,710
not be able to do a good job out of it

00:39:54,569 --> 00:40:00,180
so unless and until the top management

00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:05,010
agrees to an internship program and

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:07,980
allows that kind of business it allows

00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:10,619
that kind of financial hit into the

00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:15,510
company the internship program cannot be

00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:18,750
successful the second point is again the

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:21,510
same I mean investment in terms of money

00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,549
even though there might not be even if

00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,530
it's a free internship they might and

00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:27,450
they might not be direct compensation

00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:29,520
that you're paying to the intern it is

00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,980
possible but the investment in terms of

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,829
money is still there because it's an

00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,440
opportunity cost you are using a

00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:39,990
supervisor who is intern who's mentoring

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,900
somebody and if he's spending fifty

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:44,579
percent of his time in mentorship what

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,770
does that mean that essentially means

00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:50,700
that we are losing fifty percent of his

00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:53,030
billable time so we have to invest we

00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,140
have to plan the internship program

00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:58,230
alright tomorrow my intern is coming

00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,839
what do I do with him no that will not

00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:03,500
help and the reasons are very

00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,500
straightforward

00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,819
I will just read out a few things there

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,980
so a comprehensive internship structure

00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,319
should include include information on

00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,779
learning objectives daily

00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:25,250
responsibilities short and long-term

00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:28,289
projects supervisor assignments

00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:31,470
evaluation procedures policies and

00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:34,170
expectations orientation and off

00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,819
prodding of boring processes and these

00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:39,660
are the basic string basic things that

00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:41,190
our plan should have then the last part

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,220
is put together a compensation class

00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:46,769
please don't hire free interns they

00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:50,910
might come to you yes but they will not

00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:52,200
be invested everybody likes money all of

00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:56,069
us are sitting here for money

00:41:52,200 --> 00:42:00,480
essentially so plan a compensation

00:41:56,069 --> 00:42:03,299
program am I do do I answer your

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:08,760
question of anything any any of you guys

00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:12,619
would like to query question every day

00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,619
agrees well alright

00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:25,079
so again I like red color when I want to

00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:28,320
invest I think that's the end of my

00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,089
presentation as such in conclusion I

00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,710
would just like to say a few things

00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:35,700
which I have already said but I would

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:39,630
like to reiterate internship is a great

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:42,119
way to sustain your talent pipeline if

00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:44,040
you have an intern you know that ok I

00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,099
can take up this project because I have

00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,440
this great intern and he is capable of

00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:51,900
becoming a full-time developer or a

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,170
full-time manager or whatever in within

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,609
two months so I am able to take on this

00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,829
project because I know that i have this

00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:02,130
guy in pipeline when I am when I am

00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:03,869
hiring somebody he might come he might

00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,490
not come there have been cases when

00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:07,920
people have accepted to offer later and

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:10,290
the day of journey they call up and say

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,740
oh sorry are not coming that happens

00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:17,130
right so internship is a great way to

00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:20,460
sustain your your talent pipeline but

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:23,460
internship is not fearful for all you

00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,290
have to invest in internship in terms of

00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,540
money in terms of time in terms of

00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,700
planning it out in terms of almost

00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:33,420
everything think of internship as a

00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:37,040
full-time program and think of

00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,900
internship as a way to make you know

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,420
your tank pipeline to grow your talent

00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,310
pipeline and frankly speaking you when

00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,770
you do something like this you will be

00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:48,599
doing good for your own organization for

00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,089
the educational institute in some way

00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:56,069
because you're absorbing people and

00:43:51,089 --> 00:44:01,430
forth academy as well in some way that's

00:43:56,069 --> 00:44:01,430
all I had for today thank you questions

00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,270
any questions anything else you would

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,270
like to discuss

00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:25,530
they have to do some kind of that is a

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:28,350
question we have not been able to answer

00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,600
even in our choir we are trying trying

00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:33,750
to build and mentorship is something

00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,870
that comes I mean you might have a layer

00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:39,330
of people who are great technically but

00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,880
not all of them are mentors not all of

00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:45,720
them have that you know that thing in

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:48,360
then so that is something as as a

00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,300
manager or as a I don't know what level

00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,250
you are on but you have to be able to

00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,230
figure out in a person that yes this guy

00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,300
can act as a mentor let's try to put

00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,700
somebody and see what happens you have

00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,790
to take those kinds of risks we have

00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,830
some awesome technical people but they

00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:08,190
are not people's person they just want

00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:10,490
to sit in a corner and you can't do much

00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,490
about it

00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:31,799
because they were like I for example I

00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:35,249
love to frame I love to sit with people

00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:36,599
and teach them something but there are

00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:38,880
so many people who just don't like it

00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:41,130
it's an intrinsic thing you can't you

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,499
might be able to teach them a bit of

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,809
that but not really it comes from within

00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:48,509
so that is something you need to figure

00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:53,929
it out you there is no answer to this

00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:53,929
question essentially shows

00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,390
sure

00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,970
yeah I mean you can try to do that you

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,580
for for example in our company which we

00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:21,200
we do have a body program anybody who

00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,540
joins he has to have a body for the

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,220
first month so which walks in through

00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,880
the hoops in some way in the sense that

00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:30,770
okay a person who joins on the on the

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,020
first day he sees his email it's like

00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:35,390
full up of getting account here I get in

00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,820
account here what so many things so a

00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:41,110
buddy program yes it helps but again

00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:44,510
being a good teacher a good mentor is

00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:46,940
sort of an intrinsic quality which we

00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,100
might try to hone but it is very

00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,260
difficult to make somebody a teacher

00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,260
make somebody a mentor it's difficult

00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,850
in the valley yes

00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:10,400
totally totally I agree with that and

00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,109
and it's not not always that the person

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,349
who's new and who's being mentored

00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:17,690
learns almost every time the person who

00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,940
is mentoring also learns a lot the new

00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:23,329
perspective the new thinking lots of

00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:25,569
things a person who's fresh has so much

00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:25,569
to offer

00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:33,190
yes yes I totally agree after 19 years

00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:37,660
in the in the industry yes i agree that

00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:42,040
we are now jaded literally so we have to

00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:50,099
have that fresh perspective anything

00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:52,450
else that would be brutal developers

00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:55,839
there are competitions like google

00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:58,420
summer of code to name a month and india

00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,670
of the country where there are many

00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,170
proof

00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:03,940
videographer screeching projects every

00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,340
year every agency to be on at least one

00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:11,770
so where is that talent going who is

00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:15,670
putting that if you are saying you are I

00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:17,920
am NOT able to find them unfortunately i

00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:20,970
don't know why i don't know how where

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,200
they're going but when I look through

00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:26,710
people who are applying I look through

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,320
people who are trying to join us or I

00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:32,710
sent out feelers to everybody and not

00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:37,290
finding it is totally agree totally

00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:37,290
agree we have a lot of rupa da rent but

00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:44,290
generally I don't deny that but again

00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,910
the level of expertise you are talking

00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:49,230
about google summer of code how many

00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,230
people actually go through that

00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:08,200
not

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,200
it doesn't matter for what but you have

00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:14,939
about people on

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:33,190
by Dyson but what I mean you look back

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,020
baidu you do you actually love how do

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:40,150
you learn when you are in google summer

00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:41,980
of code how do you learn new code and

00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:47,200
you learn you don't have active members

00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:50,080
active mentorship do you agree to be

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:59,530
specific a diva there is a mentor and

00:49:50,080 --> 00:50:05,500
you yes but I participated in I have

00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:11,440
life as for any difference which is

00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:13,750
perspective on how we are not getting we

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,180
are that island is somehow hidden I

00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:19,060
don't know if I look at even if i look

00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:22,660
at generally if i look at let's it naw

00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:27,220
Kham I see I mean search for drupal and

00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:29,320
you see a huge list of resumes yes but

00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:36,730
one thing is what is the level of their

00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:37,970
own I sure face a lot with people what

00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:41,099
people don't you

00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:44,539
because this initial learning curve is

00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:44,539
to all our mothers day

00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:48,779
historian and they don't realize it

00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,650
actually they can make much more money

00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:56,119
with Drupal so I think this test also

00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:56,119
that will show this morning

00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,990
he was doing something

00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:27,980
should be totally agree yes when I

00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,290
interview a person I don't ask about the

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:34,820
language syntax I would ask for a pseudo

00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:37,400
program if I'm actually and yes normally

00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,500
I if I am hiring specifically for Drupal

00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,920
specifically but if I go for an intern

00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:45,710
thing I would like to i would not really

00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,990
want that I would not really think that

00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,270
I want a PHP developer only or a drupal

00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:52,550
developer olney i would like to think i

00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:54,560
would like to see his how his flow is is

00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,330
he is his fundamentals clear is his

00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,130
thought process clear because if a

00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,350
person can write a pseudocode he can

00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:10,090
pick up any language and go ahead with

00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:10,090
her yes

00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,690
it's not a nice language ouch yeah I

00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:30,460
agree sometimes PHP is called the

00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,920
younger sister of see in some ways which

00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:40,270
is much more open and much more okay

00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:42,510
with whatever including see totally

00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,510
early

00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,880
of us

00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,640
I

00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:57,049
exactly

00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:08,510
I'd only agree and that's what in

00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:10,370
conclusion that's exactly what I said

00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,930
what I said was that when we are

00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,340
investing in an internship program we

00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,750
are actually doing something for the

00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,370
community we are doing something for the

00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:25,970
accademia we're doing something for the

00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:27,590
students sure before a lot of these

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,870
solutions are not even aware something

00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:31,010
called a scruple my solution honestly

00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,690
speaking yesterday by the post an

00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:42,380
identical do today I know but you were

00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:45,320
in my training so they do not show after

00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:47,270
learning drupal value the life so as a

00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,500
student other pressure I would look for

00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,840
something just jobs if you're ever

00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,820
become learning something I will go for

00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,100
cloud computing is a recent finding

00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,600
things trending things I watch it

00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,910
without actually that is the reason a

00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,860
much we talking about it so I would talk

00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:04,640
about something which I have an in short

00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:10,280
future sure see justice they actually

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:13,430
shot a future so um all right google

00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,340
also ensures the future and sorry guys

00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:20,230
but we have to we have will have to move

00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,230
