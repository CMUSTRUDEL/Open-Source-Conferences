moved to drupal so trip over something

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,439
that started off as a happy and then I

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,780
saw promise and then finally I made a

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,090
carrier ship after two years since then

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,179
I've been working on Drupal and others

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,759
resolutions I am the limit enough for

00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:47,860
model called the Automator it's a

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,319
marketing automation integration or

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,840
module it's basically a 360-degree

00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,450
integration with websites so that you

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,009
can completely automate your marketing

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,840
parody and also we can make sure that

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,459
your website is in response to whatever

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,060
data that is collected so that you have

00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,099
a complete feedback and I'm also

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,289
co-founder for a small merchandise

00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,360
startup called as as it is and the whole

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,010
side is built on Drupal that was one of

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,010
the reasons I actually moved to Drupal

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,130
because I could start a small business

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,049
without any investment in website so all

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,180
the investment that I had to do was my

00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:24,459
learning of Drupal and I am also a

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:31,030
bowling addict so if anybody is up for a

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:33,340
game tonight please let me know yeah so

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,139
what we'll be talking today I will talk

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,389
about community so when you say

00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:40,299
community what is community discuss

00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:43,239
about that and we'll also share a short

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:48,459
story and how we became what we are

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,049
today so also we talk about what do we

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,730
mean by contributions we have been

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,500
hearing a lot about contributions and

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,480
this is the first time we have a severe

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,799
track for contributions as well we

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,389
talked about what contribution means

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:05,260
says then I will talk about how Superman

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:07,060
your is of contributing to Drupal so

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,500
we'll also talk about for saying I of

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,500
the manual community

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,280
yeah so what is Drupal community so

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,590
community is nothing but people

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,480
obviously so when we sit upon humanity

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,930
it's all the people that are involved

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,490
with Drupal in various ways so we'd

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,750
already talked about developers

00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,810
obviously there is a first thing it

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,060
comes to the mind and repel the

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,700
something called site builders who don't

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,660
necessarily work with the code but still

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:46,270
work with Drupal and log individuals and

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:50,550
teams who always local events like

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:55,030
meetups trainings and course prints and

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,370
drupal evangelists and business

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:05,590
development teams who work very hard to

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:07,750
promote Drupal so you just run you

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,970
through the brief history of haja

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,580
becoming day bangle so let's call it

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,150
this in store for us this is our story

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,040
and the beginning this is how Drupal

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,609
Daniel community began it all started

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,880
with a meetup in mid-2010 and it was

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:28,540
organized by my Coppola's onion circle

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,640
so who also used to work with us and the

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,830
first session had organism only for 10

00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,390
days so that some of it began in

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:40,270
bangalore and then he carried down and

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,700
the way a few events that they were

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,820
organizing and then one of the major

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,950
changes are happening dsmn release party

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,070
so there was a first time I mean Tildy

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,380
sex rupal had a linear growth and d7 was

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,990
when there was a change in perception a

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,840
quadruple so this was a first d 7 meter

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,490
and that's when not check rejoin so

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,460
there was almost around the four years

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,430
ago and this thing is that was a

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,919
lifetime when I was moving from Java so

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,140
I was kind of deciding as to whether

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,710
album or to topple Allah and it was a

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,780
time

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,850
I had started with Drupal 6 and then we

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,620
had triple seven coming up so whether to

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,390
start with Drupal 6 or directly start

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,400
with Drupal 7 so those are the questions

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,160
that I had in mind and in fact the funny

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,610
thing is that i had rsvp'd for the even

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,620
but the rsvps wet clothes so unlikely i

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,690
was not able not in the event but there

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,060
was a finding by the Letran eyes on the

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:42,880
team so can anyone recognize where I'm

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:45,400
many sense this is me so that's when I

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,140
go to Bangalore so I was before that I

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,340
was working with triple hydrabad

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,480
communities to work there so so I was

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,490
working with Drupal I never compute and

00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:03,130
then moved to van Lew so that's when

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:05,230
Drupal 7 release party happened so so

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,390
then after that the waiters are regular

00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,280
meters are used to happen and as I told

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,590
you so I was not even talking in the

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,740
show handle his party but later on I

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,070
became a part of the group and we had

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:26,020
regular meters that check ray and I were

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:27,610
carrying on and so they joked that so we

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,980
both used to say for most of the meters

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,870
and generally check we used to an event

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,910
on meter and we generally used to ask

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,230
for speakers so just if you like he was

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,180
about who used to take care of all the

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,890
Gnostics and we went for the day before

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,630
to see if there are any speakers and

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,160
then I'm gonna call in the night saying

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,890
that there are no speakers you are

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,830
further session so that you see with a

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:50,500
way how we began but today as you can

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,230
see along as we kept on dying meter so

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,390
we started get organiz team and more and

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,130
more people join and one of the things

00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,590
are interesting things that happen was

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,450
we started reaching out to colleges so

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,800
initially what used to happen in bangla

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,020
was there were many people working on

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,959
drupal in their companies but it all has

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,159
to be in there I

00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,050
environments so bringing them all

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,819
together was a challenge initially and

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,699
starting with colleges for something

00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,349
that also gave us motivation because the

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,229
students were generally like in the 30

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,429
or 40 r so one of the major concepts

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,619
would be about their career what would

00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:24,899
be good for them and have a day long

00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:26,999
session with them in fact we actually we

00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,849
did not begin with Drupal we also the

00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:32,279
rhythm watt lamp was what web is and we

00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:35,099
made sure that they had their they had

00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,689
the interest in web development and then

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,249
we get them an option of Drupal and how

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,919
to help would be considered as a carrier

00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:43,740
so though we had begun sessions in

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,449
Drupal so Drupal there was eruption for

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,639
Drupal but purpose was still not being

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,740
considered as a major option for Korea

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,719
but today we have so many people have

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,729
built a carriers from Drupal and now

00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,259
that's one of the reasons that people

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:57,209
feel that they have a given back to the

00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:02,399
community and we have more participation

00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:05,069
from the companies and as I told you

00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,240
when we started it was primarily we had

00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,069
to announce and we had to wait for

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,079
people we have to decide what dates way

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,119
better so this was kind of a turning

00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,119
point for is especially in bangle so

00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:16,860
what we try to do was we try to set up a

00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:19,199
statement saying that lost started of

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,699
every month would be the triple meter so

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
the moment this happened it became easy

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,899
for everybody not only for us because we

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,699
could organize and we could plan and

00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,229
also for all the activities they may not

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,879
think about when would be the next meter

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:31,379
so everybody knows that it's going to

00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,479
happen in the wall socket of the month

00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,689
and they could plant their calendar body

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,519
the other thing with this is we this is

00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:40,319
also means that we are committing to a

00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,400
very long period so we are not saying

00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,660
that you know this one

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,460
is a made-up and there is no meat of

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,840
next month so this means that we are

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,570
committing to every Saturday of every

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,550
month so people also can easily plan and

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,500
remember they don't need to check their

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,120
meetup calendars every time to come to

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,920
the meetup so they can just check is it

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,100
the last act of the month or not the

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,950
same for others as well and as we went

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,290
ahead we had the fewer people joining

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,170
for example and the early adopters we

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,790
had Hussein so who used to be the who

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,010
was to be present at most of our meetups

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,990
but he is not the same person that you

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,320
know now so he was a very shy guy who

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,110
never misses pickups over there drupal 7

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,650
release party after he so he was a very

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:27,840
regular attending almost all the meters

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:30,840
yeah yeah yes that's true so and then as

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,970
it says so after few meetup see went on

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,010
from passive mode to active mode and we

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:40,170
all know about his contributions and his

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:42,840
sessions and similarly we had mrs. Jaya

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,820
so this is an interesting personality

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,500
because she's not she's not from

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,970
recording background so generally

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,350
whenever we have wind-ups we have on

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,910
this code is coming up and not

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,370
sitebuilder so anybody who is working

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,650
with to panopticon so she was in fact

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,270
like an example for many people so she

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,190
was a lady who was working from heaven

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,480
whom she didn't know how to pour but she

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,150
was still building websites and

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,340
delivering it to clients so she was like

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,920
her single line used to be if i can make

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,840
it why can't you so that was the major

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,540
line for her and through that she was

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,200
able to motivate many ladies also and

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,640
also students and vishnu also around

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,700
with Thomason wish there was another

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,730
drywall

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,740
regularly present at our meetups and

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,000
pushing on which New Delhi you might say

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,520
they're missing in many photos because

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,930
there are worst are photographers so

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,360
you'll generally find them behind the

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:37,510
cameras and our recent addition so we

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,670
have sooo dish from TCS and needles from

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,700
value bomb so they are then played a

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,650
very critical role in organizing triple

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,720
camp that we had in bamboo as well as

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:52,870
many meetups and trains that we had

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,250
after that and so it's not just a few

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,770
people that I mentioned here there are

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,750
many people and this goes on and on and

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,570
as I told you so today there are more

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,060
than 5 30 people in our community both

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:10,780
in under four lab dog as well as later

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:13,210
so that's a huge team so oh that's a

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,720
little bit about how we do so what all

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:18,370
hell does during the process so one

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,620
thing as I mentioned is a consistent

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,260
meters so even though we were doing

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,140
meters before they were a little bit

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,420
earlier once we started as to how

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,250
meetups on every last saturday of things

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,380
changed and everybody's out to come to

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,840
the meat of the month and there were a

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,570
lot of other people as well who wanted

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,730
to help us organize meetups and do

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:45,490
trainings at various places as well and

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,680
so we also as mentioned earlier we

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,350
reached out to colleges and connected

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,610
lot of global training days husband so

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,279
there were few students who are

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,980
interested and join the

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,620
expect and we slowly started the

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,259
organizing ports Prince so those days of

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,019
contributing to triple cool was a very

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,600
foreign idea so we started with for

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,100
sprint husband so we had the laker two

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,199
people coming to the boats Prince I

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,410
still remember just three people sitting

00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:18,389
in the office and finishing couple of

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:20,790
issues so on and lot of support from the

00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:25,829
local community members and involvement

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:29,370
was a was very key in achieving the

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:31,620
success so I kept participation from

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,170
carpets and there's a lot so most a

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,110
minute in all these process we used to

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,089
host meetups and for everything we had

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,759
to support the only thing we needed was

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:46,410
all the energy and interest and

00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,509
partnerships with nonprofits so we also

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,939
partnered with the free software

00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:53,129
movement Karnataka and I should be

00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,959
student body as well so that we can

00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:57,089
reach to other open source communities

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,639
as well as the student bodies within the

00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,500
educational institutions this was one of

00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:09,750
the key decisions which also helped us

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:11,850
or propagate Drupal we we use various

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,980
tools for organizing meetups and keeping

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,920
everybody in the hood but the tombola

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,480
Lisa make sure that loser drupal.org is

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,120
the primary resource because that's

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,860
where everybody texting so whenever we

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,980
have the events we made sure that it

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,180
goes on don't forgot all and no one of

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,250
the things that people generally miss

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,019
all these meetups you have so many new

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,000
people coming to the meetup soil first

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,370
time so it's very important to tell them

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,199
that what is important info to cut out

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,360
why should they create a profile on

00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,639
polar or and why should they join the

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
purple haha so that was one thing that

00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,839
we ensure that at the end of every meter

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,730
we made sure that we pass on that

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,130
information and what were the time we

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,750
had

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:54,640
numbers increasing in groups article and

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:58,510
as I told you or so generally we used to

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:01,600
announce all the events on de pelota but

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,890
for RSVP we primarily used meat of the

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,870
outcome because it was very convenient

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:09,700
and it was easy for people to RSVP so

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,190
that was about meter the other thumb

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,740
thumb rule is whenever we get RSVPs in

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,230
the meter so we can we just need to plan

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,630
for fifty percent off that's almost the

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,340
exact average so if we plan for fifty

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,410
percent of the actual RSVP stuck with

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,720
people good enough so along with others

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:34,510
because it used to help us get the

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:37,510
organizing things fifty percent say

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:41,320
exactly office RSVPs to actual attendees

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:43,540
say 500 people RSVP to the event fifty

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:50,140
percent would turn on the Eiffel meter

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:52,240
the outer meter what strings you can

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,000
really have this audience but for the

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,700
general user is the number statistic

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,530
like 10 of the one who's tall is VP and

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,450
out of that only fifty percent is

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,980
returned one for you so once we got

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,530
whose roots it was easier for the story

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,210
plan so noble training days we had a

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,270
better than this as we were reaching out

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,220
to colleges and it was made as a

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:17,220
compulsory session and stop say it

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:20,440
depends on college to college for that

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,570
we work with H ok now which we should I

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,490
University it was like you know it's a

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:29,040
saturday it's a learning session for you

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:32,500
we must attain yeah if you want with the

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,570
professors and thinks it they will make

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:39,610
it compulsory for them it's just one day

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:42,760
of the training yeah as you should use

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,160
the Facebook for primary primarily for

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,560
marketing so we also made sure that

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,240
weekly or whenever we had

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,570
but in the event we clean up in scales

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,430
celkon also so which centers forget to

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:58,860
move people which better platform and

00:15:53,430 --> 00:16:00,510
facebook page to people that was

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,790
something that we started using off lei

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,740
especially it's really helpful when

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,529
you're planning a bigger event for exam

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,120
started with drupalcamp angle so there

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:11,220
were so many threads of communications

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,990
are used to happen so slack was very

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,610
helpful because we could have a channel

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,529
for each communication so for example

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,330
you have different people in each

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,400
category so for marketing we had one

00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,710
channel and for planning one channel and

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,779
also we try to have various integrations

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,430
for example the website when the

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,740
registrations happen for the triple camp

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,080
we had an integration with slide so that

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,000
we can track all the registrations in

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,270
real time so this was something that

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,250
give us a better insights and and it had

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,620
this plan reach out to people especially

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,050
for drupal can bad news so this was

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,700
something that needed was particularly

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,920
concentrating and whenever we have this

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,510
notifications used to make sure that the

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,110
team reaches out to all the people for

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,280
register so actually see the screenshot

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,890
you see all the registrations

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,570
registration wizard from users or so

00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,570
whether there is somebody with a string

00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,100
from drupalcamp will get a notification

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,020
so that's also very exciting for the

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,420
people motivating to the people who are

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,120
actually working yeah so that's one

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,270
importantly not only here or slack is

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,579
also used almost jubilee within the

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,439
Drupal community so we are using slack

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,870
within a mile in your local community

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:23,790
and we're using slacker to click on Asia

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:26,189
as well since the mid central camp was

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,959
built on Drupal so education was a

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:31,640
simple as enabling a module and sitting

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,900
a few rules so and we had the indication

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,500
yeah so we are talking about

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:41,910
contributions so contributions are more

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,320
than code so it's not just about fold so

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,150
generally when we talk about

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,540
contributions we talk about corporations

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,110
if you see this keynote so the

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,100
congregation

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:56,850
work was for contributions so the top 10

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,760
core contributors so they contributed

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,490
modules also claimed major role in

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:06,840
helping triple so pathways and gray

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:08,520
roles the documentation it is so this is

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,350
something within release stress whenever

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,470
we have a good sprint and there are new

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:16,410
people who wants to start contributing

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,320
documentation it is and testing as well

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,900
so it's also importantly if a ribbon is
