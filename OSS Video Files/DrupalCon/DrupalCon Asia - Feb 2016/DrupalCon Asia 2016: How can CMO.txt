further emphasized all that point so let

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,200
me take a step back here so in marketing

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,910
there is this notion of this

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,650
metaphorical fun okay st. Regis so for

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,509
those of you who have followed it dies

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,490
in marketing as industry for a long time

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,130
but know this there is this notion of

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,800
this linear funnel so the idea is that

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,140
you start you know with a broader number

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,689
of opportunities or needs and threw the

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,410
foul it can reduce this you eliminate

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,780
you know the peripheral you know once

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,610
there and you you're you come up with

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,540
the actual opportunities which are there

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,390
great potion by the way but it's menial

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:46,440
you start at the top demand and you end

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,690
up with the actual sale right now

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,510
Forrester made this case this was I

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,120
think about 34 years ago that this

00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:00,719
funnel is no more linear this is a Jag

00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,480
it actually looks like this what is that

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,189
mean it actually does so what happens is

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,840
that if you look at I know this is not

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,240
readable but i'll just give you a sense

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,939
so if you look at these phases there's

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,680
awareness there is consideration there

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,360
is preferable action and then there is

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,640
loyalty in terms of repeat business if

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,909
you think about that now if i look at

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,020
this then with this structure this new

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,970
structure I could move back and forth so

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,740
I'm pretty much you know I'm talking to

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,130
aunt cui about a product and I like the

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,710
product and I really prefer that third

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,890
stage in a linear fun but I got a call

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,270
from a shop good friend of mine right he

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,920
said you know what I think you should

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,979
consider X and because I trust some more

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,560
than I trust and where do I like them

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:53,579
I'm just saying right so in that case

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,750
the chances are I'm again here right so

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,550
that's how it works and why is this

00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,140
and I am going to come on to that point

00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,390
a little bit later but why is this

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,860
important now this is important because

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,270
we have means to do this today right

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,149
much more effective means that we had

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,400
like 10 years ago okay so you get this

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,080
idea of how it was yesterday how what it

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,630
is changing to today and in the coming

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,200
years so this is a disruption that is

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,820
caused by you the consumers and come me

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,790
they're really struggling to be honest

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,680
in terms of figuring this beef you know

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,500
how to wrap their arms around this so

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,540
think about these pictures I I won't

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,090
spend a lot of time here but how you

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,790
plan your trips how you identify the

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,340
right restaurants how you do shopping

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,140
how you meet people that this isn't that

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,959
you make about you know buying something

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,750
and just a chat message or something

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,330
like that right so this has can a tongue

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,820
turn to its head in terms of that push

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,520
based model of marketing and messaging

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,800
the c'mon driven marketing and asking if

00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,190
I may call it that and the problem is

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,810
the consumer is always connected I mean

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,989
you would see people fiddling with their

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,360
phones my friend right there and back

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,730
has some work to do so I don't people

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,030
always always be even in the light I I

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:17,080
check my emails 239 people do that right

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,489
they all disconnected so so here's what

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,110
I'm saying here is the net net or what

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm saying and the argument I am

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,440
proposing and the case i'm making is

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,420
that this consumer is actually the open

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,510
source consumer and think about the

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,100
values so why am I saying that I am

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,190
saying that this consumer wants to

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,840
interact with the source they don't want

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,640
to be spoon-fed they don't want to be

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,620
told this is the right shoe for you this

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,590
is right shirt for you this is the right

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,750
movie for you to watch they want to make

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,280
their own definition own sense out of it

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,080
this is

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,030
right thing to me right based on

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,160
multiple factors so they won't interact

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,290
with the source they want to innovate

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,260
where communities and even example here

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,120
and this is a little Indian context for

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,550
those of you from around here who

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,700
perhaps understand but would be able to

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:12,060
correlate so my wife when she has to she

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:15,480
has to buy some girly stuff she would

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,190
talk to her sister and friends and they

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,500
would share pictures I mean I'm sure

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,450
your witness this Rite or another

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,730
example is look at facebook you would

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,640
find so many pictures of food people

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,350
taking pictures of food right they are

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,080
promoting the brand of that food for

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,060
free for nothing right they're not

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,130
getting paid that these are people you

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,729
and I know these are our friends right

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,790
so things like that so this is inherent

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,000
it asks as human beings to work in

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,490
communities we are not robots that's how

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,930
we communicate we used to you know if

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,690
you think about the other generation we

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,930
used to operate in communities by

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,229
physical closeness today we have other

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,770
means like social networks and all which

00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:03,750
bring a much larger set if you will for

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,820
us to build communities around and we do

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,370
do that we might not know that I

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,580
recognize that they need juggle a

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,890
conversation they need a dialogue which

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,450
is no one way thing right it has to be

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,320
bidirectional I tell you that this is

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,630
what I want and they want that the

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,750
feedback that they give that's actually

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,740
incorporated in the product and

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,940
transparency is part of that and got in

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,590
a research which is one of the top

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,140
analyst firms it kind of said the same

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,690
things but because God has said it not

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,020
me it has more value cigars and said

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,810
that customers love their peers more

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,870
then they toss their peers none saw in

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,970
my life but then they trust you and the

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,640
other thing which is important for us in

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,289
the industry is that across industries

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,419
across areas so in same size

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,610
Street professional communities within

00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:59,830
their region within their cohorts they

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,689
rely on this their communities more than

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:07,539
they rely on you this is the Gartner

00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:09,460
research right and what I am saying is

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,229
something that brands some branch

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,689
already recognized and they are already

00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:16,839
kind of coming to terms with this they

00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:19,029
were working on this Procter & Gamble

00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,169
has this initiative which solve being

00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:25,719
girl amazingly shaded which talks about

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:27,159
girl things right it's about them it's

00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,139
not about proctoring animal if you go to

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:31,180
the site you will not see anything

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,399
procter & gamble it's about the audience

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,360
right so they can collaborate

00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,979
communicate give feedback PlayStation

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,749
has beautiful communities you think

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:48,399
about them and starbucks saw my stop

00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:49,569
hook bucks idea this is a Sawbuck site

00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,099
where you can actually give your

00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:52,749
feedback communicate within the

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,180
community and they incorporate your

00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:57,009
feedback and these are sets where

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,259
they've actually completed your feedback

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,539
of what you want this as consumers as

00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,399
their customers right so some brands

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:04,930
some companies are actually really

00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,569
understanding this and really

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,639
implementing it let me pause it for a

00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:11,499
moment I want to talk about switch gears

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,749
and talk about technology in a separate

00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:16,499
we talked about the strategic aspect of

00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:20,289
this of you know how open sources

00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:24,249
becoming a common phenomena and let's

00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:28,589
talk about the technology aspect all

00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:34,749
right so how many of you know this guy

00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:37,629
anyone all right so I'm so this is a

00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:40,479
full of Scott breaker one of the leading

00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:43,209
authorities and marketing technology he

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,759
runs this block Chief Mark techcom if

00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:49,149
you don't follow him and if you own this

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,659
space you must follow it okay so

00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,009
squadron color is known for the super

00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:56,400
grass

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,809
that he rolls out every year and I have

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,469
been following him for some some time

00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:04,499
now so as of 2015 this super graphic

00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:06,930
which by the way it depicts the Khan

00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:09,809
samba love marketing technologies that

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,149
exists out there so sup 2015 they've

00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:15,779
almost 2000 vendors in forty three

00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:18,809
categories 2000 of them and let me also

00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:21,569
tell you that before that the year

00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:24,210
before that they were like 1300 and

00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:27,059
before that it was like thousand of

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,120
these vendors so look at the pace these

00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:34,860
technologies are growing that marketers

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:38,069
use so many of them right so what does

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,380
mean it means that heterogeneity is

00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:44,430
actually a marketing technology reality

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,949
and Forrester said it very right Anjali

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,870
ukunda who is a senior dasteen Forrester

00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:51,420
she said and I'm going to read some

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,910
excerpts from this she said that right

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,769
now no vendor has a Singh has every

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,949
single component despite of what they

00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:01,380
claim to some vendors which I'm sure you

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:04,709
know do claim that they have this thing

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:08,010
figured out and which she also said that

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:10,800
many of our clients would not rip and

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:15,000
replace the existing investments key

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,100
point right so what folks look for is

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,290
that they want to have the best of

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:25,610
defenders and make their own stack this

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:33,110
should be telling now if that's true

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:33,110
then single sweet solutions cannot work

00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:37,319
the solutions that sell you those

00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:40,409
umbrella things and say oh you know what

00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:42,989
this blanket he will solve every puzzle

00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:47,099
in the marketing technology that does

00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:48,599
not mean that they do not sell and as a

00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:51,329
matter of fact you are in some

00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:54,239
situations they are actually good for it

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:57,329
as well as I would argue right but by

00:09:54,239 --> 00:10:01,469
that argument having everything with one

00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:06,119
vendor is not the solution and brian

00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:07,529
Solis who is a game of major authority a

00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:10,829
leading authority in marketing

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:14,819
technology he kind of term this notion

00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:17,399
in terms of digital Darwinism he said

00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:19,559
and I quote him that we are living in an

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,439
era where technology and society on

00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:27,419
recording faster than businesses can

00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:29,159
adapt that's the problem that's the

00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:32,489
problem right so take an example in

00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:35,579
India we did not have enough penetration

00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:38,609
in terms of landline phones the buyer

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:42,329
forms right many people did not have it

00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:44,189
but we skip that and not the penetration

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:47,279
that we have in mobile is through the

00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:49,439
roof and because we have such

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,199
penetration mobile in India it's

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:55,459
important for organizations brands

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:57,809
product companies to think about mobile

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,299
because we have that penetration it's

00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:02,369
the consumers it's you who adapted and

00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,869
you force the branch you for the

00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:08,069
companies you force the products or

00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:10,949
organizations out there to think about

00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:13,469
you the platforms that you use and the

00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:17,759
the underpinning of this is that there

00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:20,299
has to be constant innovation and what I

00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,929
want to argue is that if you need that

00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,929
then you need google

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:33,700
so let me preface this argument a little

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,830
bit so if you have worked with marketing

00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,019
technology solutions enough I know few

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,870
of us have I know um it has worked on it

00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:45,250
for a very long time I myself have had

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:47,110
worked on it for over 15 years so your

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,690
website is the centerpiece of your

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,300
marketing technologies that right it's

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,950
hub-and-spoke thing so everything that

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,050
you do whether you do your search

00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,470
engines or you will be easy campaigns or

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,600
you do some you know offline media

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,470
optimization unique content and assets

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,690
and these somewhere sit on your website

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,660
right so you think about this or you

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,579
think about the systems that integrate

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,829
it with with it so whether it's your

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,930
marketing resource management system or

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:20,350
some other third-party relational

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:24,149
systems or document management website

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:27,970
is kind of the linchpin if you will and

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:30,100
don't take my word for it this is an

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,680
example this is a real example so cheap

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,800
more tech organises these awards

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,110
therefore this techies awards and

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,240
winners of stacking awards and you see

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,250
here so this is intelligence bank and

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,529
Australian company it's not a bank of

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,839
the name might confuse your product

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,420
company and this is the actual marketing

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,550
stack marketing technology stack these

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,120
are all the technologies they use within

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,260
their marketing organization right so

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,570
that originality that I was talking

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,480
about right now look at this picture and

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,500
may be difficult to read the lot of

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,020
elements here like advil retargeting and

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,779
your Salesforce or CRM Google Analytics

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,959
all that but the argument I'm making is

00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:15,760
that look at these connections here most

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,810
number of connections are made to

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,970
trooper what because competent is you

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:27,450
centerpiece right so that that's what I

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,400
am saying I am stating the obvious so

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:34,520
let's talk about how duple does this

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:37,740
right so we talked about innovation so I

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,900
was having a discussion with with

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,440
someone about couple weeks ago and we

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,130
were talking about how fast Li are the

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,250
presentation technology is changing

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:50,279
right so they are new technologies

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:53,970
coming every six months if not every

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:57,029
month angular was was the thing and then

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,000
react GS is now the thing so many other

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:02,760
things right then I coming you know so

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,450
if you if you really reach into what

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,120
brands will is said that and I kinda

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,160
like that is that you know marketers are

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,110
always sitting on the fence on whether

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,760
they want to make investment into the

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,890
existing set of technologies which are

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,260
relevant today or they want to make the

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,610
futuristic investments right because

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,470
they have something which is relevant

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,230
today and they have to make sure that

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,390
you know it keep running the engines

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,740
keep running right and there is

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,720
something in the future which they don't

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,870
know which is an unknown but which is

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,600
also a fear which is which could be suck

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,940
their business if some of you attended

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,650
grease mode or later days of Jesus was

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,780
talking about how Phillips put big of a

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,540
networking company how Phillips could

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,920
become you know more than a lighting

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,230
company if you win which it is today

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,420
which is so true so destruction would

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,520
come from anywhere and you have to be

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,580
aware of that and the answer is that you

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,250
have to have systems technically which

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,310
allow you to innovate which do not stock

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,290
you in terms of flexibility and I think

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,600
about me and I know you most of you guys

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,640
are are really converse end with these

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,589
technologies that for think about them

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,270
some of the other stats are out there

00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,120
they would restrict you in one way or

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,339
another but we're triple you won't be

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,950
restricted because the sheer flexibility

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,430
right so there's so many modules the API

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,410
is so so open and everybody can can kind

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,900
of interact with the source so you can

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,810
make your own stack are given

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,790
hey so that's one that's a big one in my

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:38,760
view so innovation that that's the

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:42,900
backdrop for innovation okay um only

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,100
chance so we always talk about this

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,410
during conversations have been

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,030
consulting for a long time and we used

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,670
to have these discussions back in the

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,370
day a couple years ago now it's more

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,500
relevant people have more interfaces to

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,430
deal with but if you really think about

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,350
how content is created in most systems

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:04,610
you work backwards from the from the

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:07,770
structure we call it the content model

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,720
so so those of you who are not aware of

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,260
this this idea of the content model

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,150
which i'm sure most of you are the way

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,010
content model works is that you identify

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,770
that this is what the content structure

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:22,020
would be these this is how the

00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,690
relationship would be so you can set it

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,990
in stone you start from that right and

00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,120
then you know presentation can add rows

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:33,690
up from that that's how it works in more

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,490
systems in Drupal it's not like that so

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,020
many people and I will give you a

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,000
tactical example those of you who have

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,850
seen trooper and we have seen some other

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,770
CMS interfaces sometimes people come to

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,570
us and they ask that why don't you have

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,880
a tree like structure in terms of

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,800
content management you don't need that

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,100
because content doesn't work like that

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,330
it does not have a hierarchy you don't

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,910
need that right but that needs to

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,980
explain so if you we create content

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,840
first you create content first and if

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,390
you create content first not structure

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,800
first then it can be ingested in any

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:11,100
form whatsoever it can be adjusted on

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,740
web interface it can ingest it on your i

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,990
watch or whatever right because you did

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,709
not create it key dinner in structure in

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:24,870
mind appointed model in mind so that's

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:26,730
an argument there the other one is about

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:30,000
integration so we talked about in the

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:33,930
different systems so integration is a

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,970
big problem there is a there is a very

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,100
renowned marketing

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,830
consulting from its court we consultancy

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,870
have you heard of them yeah so they had

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,480
a roller report I think it was a couple

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:50,789
of years ago when and they asked about

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:53,610
the key pain points and of that survey

00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:55,350
what came out was that integration of

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,740
the biggest challenge for most marketers

00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,179
because there's so many systems they

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,309
cannot kill their systems and if it is

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,890
true then there is nothing better than

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:07,169
rupal they are 11,000 third-party

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,330
modules I am NOT saying all of them are

00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,039
just right but think about it you if you

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,870
need integration with Eloqua you have a

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,940
model if you need integration with Pardo

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,220
in alimony you need integration with

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,830
Andy CRN system in all probability you

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,600
have a model eleven thousand of them so

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:25,799
how much pain it takes away in terms of

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,450
your implementation right there are

00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,850
about thousand which are already

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,270
available for Drupal 8 because we are

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:36,030
talking to play the API which it was

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,900
already already pretty exhaustive with

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:42,659
Drupal 8 it becomes even more powerful

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:46,140
and you can control it you know in terms

00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:50,669
of how does X's and permissions and HDL

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:52,559
doing acid spit a Quay also has one of

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:54,450
our offerings which is for a queer

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,000
content hub which kind of standardized

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,490
is this in terms of you know how you can

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,530
integrate with with other systems I

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,059
wouldn't talk about it if you want to

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,100
know more about it by all means come to

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,110
me and and we chat about content half

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,830
but integration is something that is

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,409
they well cat it to you know Google

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,970
perspective and then customers talk

00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:17,190
about Twitter time to delivery and I

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,740
think this is one obstacle I speak from

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,950
experience I speak from experience

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,309
reprimanding

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:26,549
CNR systems this is one aspect we're

00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:31,080
almost no other system beeps to go in

00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:34,230
terms of quicker time to market and the

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,360
reason is that it gives you so much out

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:42,149
of the box they are so so powerful

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,070
aspects of Drupal that will make you

00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:46,080
produce something very very quickly and

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,120
which will not be you know you know a

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,909
bad job in terms of that quick output

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,149
right this is where drupal wins other

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:56,039
than that you know we at we internally

00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:58,200
is working on the lightning the store

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,500
which is noble sauce project which is

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,389
essentially a compendium of the best of

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,679
breed modules which will accelerate your

00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:09,210
development time so there are

00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:12,360
distributors like that I cannot resist

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,070
but talk about another another product

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,159
that we have which is again built on the

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,620
top of to pursue its Trubel in terms of

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,330
its core foundation it's for Acquia

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,480
cloud site bactrian the reason I talk

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,899
about it is either is one of our

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,100
customers and they actually reduce their

00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:34,049
time to market by sixty percent this is

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,700
the metric right i mean you would not

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:38,279
hear this kind of matric anywhere else

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,100
it was just by standardizing one on one

00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:44,010
platform so it drupal actually allows

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,110
you with Twitter time to delivering all

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,480
right so one of the biggest objections

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,519
that we hear about quite often is that

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,760
all this is great but it's not

00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:57,350
enterprising rate we do here or that

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,630
you're starting to dry stuff and I

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:04,200
wanted to put this graphic out this is a

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:07,019
depiction of different platforms and how

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,090
their elimination on this fortune 500

00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,370
companies the top 500

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,830
for identifying and if you look at that

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,500
the blue one is by the way Drupal and

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,020
then there is a local site for but the

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,260
maximum of them out of this list our

00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,480
approval so this is an enterprising ever

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:32,730
gets if someone tells you this is not

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:36,920
enterprise right okay so um I am nearing

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:40,050
the closure of this so I want to get a

00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,440
make a make the bigger point for the

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:46,620
climax which is that this is actually an

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,650
opportunity for you guys more than

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,870
anything else this is actually an

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,800
opportunity for implementers for

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,450
consultants and why is that it is

00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,790
because of the flexibility you get

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,220
because of the acceleration you get and

00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,010
because of the value you can trade for

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,580
your customers right so what I propose

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,380
is that and this by no means is is the

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,430
holy grail but this is just you know

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:17,700
something that i can have sketched

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:20,310
roughly so i propose this model for you

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,290
in terms of what you could do how you

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,870
could create value on the top of Group

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,670
think about it right so at the bottom

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,540
you have this technology implementation

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,740
our skype so you have an amazing

00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,230
extensible development framework or

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,740
Drupal equal to anything you want to do

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,270
right you have developer tools they are

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,610
developer tools available outside their

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,180
developer tools available from companies

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,830
like I quia which we can talk more about

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,920
which amazing imagery allow you to

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,500
create quick powerful secure reliable

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,170
sites write amazing the bathrooms you

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,090
leverage with these tools as as

00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,310
implementers and then you implement them

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,320
on platforms which are scalable and

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,510
robust you don't have to worry about any

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,540
of that you focus on your strengths and

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,909
what is your strength this thing and I'm

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,239
talking

00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:13,840
not this guy out right here the swim

00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:16,960
name is your strength you understand the

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,169
customer your customer whether it's a G

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,809
company or financial services company or

00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:26,229
a media company you know their use cases

00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:28,149
better than us let me say that exactly

00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:30,369
or any product company to that matter

00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:33,269
you know it better than the Drupal

00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:36,970
community because you're dead with that

00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:39,429
right you know those the buying journey

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,049
if I recall it and the touch points that

00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:43,359
need to be graded how they need to be

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:46,239
created you know it very well so this is

00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:49,690
an opportunity for you to create those

00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:51,519
package solutions for your customers so

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,399
invest your time here is what I argue

00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,440
don't invest your time here this will

00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,090
accelerate the whole thing for you so

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,249
you invest your time here so this is a

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,830
technology bit the other aspect of this

00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:07,210
argument is that you also have an

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,879
opportunity to perform consulting focus

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:13,690
what I call the open source consumer or

00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:15,249
the open consume right so in consulting

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,080
and I know most of you are business guys

00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:20,320
so you will get it this weekend resonate

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,259
with you you have an opportunity of

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,639
creating personas so in marketing

00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:27,190
there's this notion of person as we

00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:30,129
identify attributes and then you define

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,259
so so for the broader audience i'm sure

00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:34,809
many of you get it but the idea is that

00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,759
I know that this guy loves travel I know

00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,649
that you know this guy is interested in

00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:40,840
Saudi never product and based on these

00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:43,869
data points over time i define that this

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,539
is what this guy is now this guy does

00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:49,389
not be one person it could mean a much

00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:52,029
broader audience and that has to sync

00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:55,299
with what I have to offer that's a good

00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:58,659
core strategy so marketing has a social

00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:01,690
person up you can create a strategy for

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:05,549
those open source personals because that

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:08,129
does not exist right

00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:11,759
and you can create this from so so this

00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:13,559
is the consulting framework measurement

00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,860
so you from designation of the audience

00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:18,899
to the broader story two channels they

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,700
need to tap into based on analytical

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:22,230
reader that you have all of that to

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,690
measurement how will you measure it it

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,110
how are you cannot bring it back in the

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:31,619
in the loop if you will right so you

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:34,379
could do all of that here and you can

00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:36,629
actually wear this define road maps

00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:38,639
which you do I know most of you right

00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:40,830
you can define road maps of what it

00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:45,509
looks like and how they can constantly

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:49,700
innovate which is the underlying idea i

00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:53,129
am trying to get across so conclusively

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:56,899
what I'm really saying is that this is

00:25:53,129 --> 00:26:00,720
your chance and this for you to decide

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:05,279
whether you want to be a co per share

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:09,210
and notice is that cookbooks and cook

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,409
myself nothing like a chef but but what

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,509
I really say that this is your

00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:16,049
opportunity to create your signature

00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:18,779
dish whether you do run of the mill

00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:22,950
websites with Drupal or you actually

00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:26,129
create some value and think about it

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:28,109
when you talk solutions you can sell it

00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:31,230
for much more I'm sure most of you know

00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:33,600
if you talk tactics with your customers

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,119
they paying for tactics include rock

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,029
solutions in vain for solution because

00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,499
they think in terms of their pain points

00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:44,190
so you're upsetting this whole

00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:45,749
conversation to evade different level so

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:50,129
this is the opportunity I think with

00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:52,470
that I think I can close my in case i am

00:26:50,129 --> 00:26:55,649
making here and open it up for any

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,269
questions have about 10 minutes any

00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:59,269
questions on this so far

00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:09,789
I'm sorry okay so the question is how

00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:12,520
does the content of work I I think i can

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:14,049
give you more details if you come and

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,809
meet me in the goal for there in

00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:19,919
Jerusalem web audience if but the idea

00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:23,440
behind content hub really is a

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:26,730
bi-directional orchestration and making

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:31,059
sure that you eliminate on tenth silos

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,980
in the long-term road map it wouldn't

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:36,460
just be content it will be any type of

00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,529
objects right so you have your bigger

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,690
customers that you have the different

00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:42,450
type of you know functionality sitting

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,460
and they they could be used elsewhere

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,860
right so how do you repurpose those

00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,440
investments is the idea at a very high

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:54,750
level I could have a technical

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,750
discussion with you if you want

00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:06,090
where are you position this

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:07,350
how do you position this time that

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:13,639
that's a great question and I think

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:16,470
that's so in my view deaths and

00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:20,220
educational thing right it's not just

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:22,590
this framework it's any framework so

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,549
what I would say from my own experience

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:29,609
is that they could be resistance then

00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:31,470
when you try to influence change in

00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:33,809
organization which I can set in a

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:37,919
certain way they could be resistance for

00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:42,389
sure so I hear you but if at all you can

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,039
step back and you can assure your

00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:46,619
customer that you're their trusted

00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,470
partner and you can have conversation

00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:52,859
