00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,479
beauties i joined the Drupal community

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,960
six or seven years ago as a super

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,610
developer and now I'm product that ever

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,290
managed I want to

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:37,110
deliver to project measure an alligator

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,570
summary so what am I going to talk about

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,430
today I'm going to talk about the Drupal

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,130
8 distribution which has really

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:49,320
revolution the Swiss digital industry so

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,530
the website I'm going to talk about the

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,360
largest chocolate websites are Swiss

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,390
websites can be impressive as that's the

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,140
case they are based in Switzerland and

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,320
they are the photos for news and digital

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,960
media so the website found a lot of

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,890
channels TV channels newspaper radio

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,230
station and they have built a portal to

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:19,110
actually have all of those channels into

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,760
16 nope I'm to put down yet so those two

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,760
websites the first one is a Swedish

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,600
fights I give you the URL the slides

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,830
will be available on the page of the

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,890
Rubicon so if you need get your red

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,739
chicken Swedish ice one very very big

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,720
media site and loot on maybe you've

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:44,549
heard about that maybe not probably not

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,350
it's French and Swiss maybe not and I am

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,030
not the one who actually said that was

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,090
the biggest websites in the world

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,580
actually dress say that you can find it

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,750
on his Twitter he said probably the

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,510
biggest website see what's couple of

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,269
months ago under a chance maybe not yet

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,450
maybe it does chance to need to check

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,360
but in October 2015 chris said that with

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,090
4.2 million pageviews per month Pluto

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,820
the saloon website that shot is probably

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,450
the biggest the largest websites built

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,459
with Drupal 8 if you look at the date

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,130
18th October it's before the release the

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,350
actual 8.0 release of the panic so the

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,970
biggest websites did whisper it were

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,870
actually built before too polite was

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,180
released pretty impressive I be built on

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,010
site and they were like I will say they

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,959
were post launch before the actual

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,810
release of the place so they were

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,680
working with

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:42,440
beta version of the place they were both

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,270
both built out of the same description

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,340
we are going to see what the institution

00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:54,980
it's each one MTH and it's a play based

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:59,420
situation so what's the story once upon

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,340
a time we had this giant media company

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,010
who owns many different channels TV

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,200
station radio newspapers and they wanted

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:10,340
to consolidate every single thing they

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,910
have into one giant bottle basically the

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,920
model everything into one bottle we also

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,200
had one of their competitor one of their

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,090
main competitor called the DOM and they

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,340
wanted to actually revamp their own

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,930
publishing portal same way but they only

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:29,840
had three months they have a very short

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:33,440
deadline to actually David project never

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,960
miss the deadline and we had gas man

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,419
another copy of them I think it's been

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,750
smaller and sensing they wanted

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:43,700
everything to in one place for the

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,520
information portal those three

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,990
competitors we're facing common issues

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,520
they are facing the same issues they

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,460
have the same problems not the same

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,500
customers so the same product so how do

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,740
you solve the program when you have the

00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,190
same program as your familiars basically

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,510
then you need to work together how do

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,600
you work together with your computer

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:08,990
that's a good question it can be hard so

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,380
that's a quote for me and I really find

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,470
anything else but basically they realize

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,180
that they could not fix all of those

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,360
issues if they were funding the

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:24,259
innovations by themself okay

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:28,129
so the only solution that bomb was to

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:31,159
work together into funding a common open

00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,719
source project so that in that case they

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:35,270
could actually benefit from the work of

00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:37,639
all of those people are working on the

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,879
same project and then implement or tweak

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,500
it a bit so that they can actually

00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:47,569
improve it for their own purpose and

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,150
that's what open source photos that's

00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:53,060
what Drupal cantaloupe I'm not the first

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,969
one to actually talk about that if you

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,310
know the Acquia LSD in shape the

00:05:55,969 --> 00:06:00,620
large-scale polish a they have actually

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,340
started a long time ago to actually put

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,159
committers together to actually solve

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,349
the problems that they all face right

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:12,229
that's a great interesting job if you

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:15,639
have not heard about it you can actually

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:19,250
find it difficult LSD straight on member

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,169
and the thing with the distribution

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,169
actually I'm not the one who discovered

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:27,379
that dress again please when you could

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:31,039
blaze like right Fred and he said that's

00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:33,949
in 2010 that's at some point he's still

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,969
okay sir at some point 2010 the West the

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:39,560
meta web was really really miss everyone

00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:42,919
was in family gives whole integration

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,490
with its own service we had nothing to

00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:49,099
actually put things together that's what

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,740
Drupal rellos you solve a common issue

00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:56,210
into a dedicated module for example or

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,939
see more library in order to standardize

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,589
the cost if you do that it's going to

00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,060
really reduce the training the

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,789
maintenance that yoga QR code our

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,860
website because you can just take from

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,120
the community from the contribution you

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,060
don't need to maintain every single step

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,919
the security or so you can just upgrade

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,729
to a new version and get all the

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:18,009
security updates and of course in to

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:22,099
optimize for your internal resources

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:24,230
that's super important and what the

00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,960
distribution is and

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,790
it's actually to put all of those server

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,400
for your programs into one big package

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,050
and then you install that everybody is

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,650
familiar with the description you can

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:40,810
draw a decision ok so what that's what

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:44,930
the decision is it packs many modules

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:47,390
configurations content seems libraries

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,220
into one main portal that you can

00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:54,050
install and then tweak based on your

00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,760
needs that's how the NP 8 distribution

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,490
mkay it is for a new spot whole

00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:03,890
distribution came out who found it at at

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,950
the very beginning two of the computers

00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,500
that have presented previously the Sonia

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:13,130
Sonia is the web agency that is boned by

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,190
Sri defiance and gas man media same

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:20,780
thing your web agency internal agency

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,820
home by the gas man group who did the

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,890
implementation that's interesting part

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,830
it's a Swiss company many some of you

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,860
knows them and this system very big

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,140
cultural now 12 an eight or so to 21

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,610
general that's a very big opportunity

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:40,310
they are based in Sweden enjoyed in

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:42,710
church drink and how did that NP a

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,849
detergent get developed that's also

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,850
interesting i'm not going to go very

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,010
deep into that took one year one full

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,730
year to actually implement that

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,950
implement that decision was based on two

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,630
weeks sprint backlog so they were every

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,520
two weeks they were releasing the

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,270
version of the of the distortion and

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,220
send that to both to the two clients the

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,810
two computers and say okay let's just

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,600
take how we move forward from them every

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,130
two weeks for when you're here are three

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,780
people three four times the wrappers

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,850
from in this system and two guys for

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,819
time from the customers to actually

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,379
review make

00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:19,949
so the theme arcade make sure the future

00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:22,499
are flexible generation now so it was

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:24,509
really like time consuming for cokin to

00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:26,549
actually develop a solution I that

00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:28,919
really that a big investment to that

00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:31,169
distribution it's one hundred percent

00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,919
test-driven using nihat maybe you have

00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:36,979
your whiskey happening and it's the one

00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:41,149
represents the idea you can test

00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:41,149
everything deployed everything easily

00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:48,689
you have you in the end what as this

00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,199
specific destruction wrought to trouble

00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:56,910
42 contribute modules or built by AMD

00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:58,979
system guys 15 crystal Rogers features

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,109
that are big features that are included

00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:06,209
into the distribution itself that I'm

00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:11,339
not open sourced and all the steps for

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:13,889
the test okay some features that this

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,169
news portal provides out of the box and

00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,619
there are many more and you can read the

00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:21,509
full list on their website actually

00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:23,819
whole publishing you install you have a

00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:26,429
true a website ready for provision you

00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:28,409
can publish anything use all the dossier

00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:30,329
or region you have appt a walk if you

00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:33,659
want to have content that is only

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:35,989
display or accessible to specific to

00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:38,129
page users actually can sell content

00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:39,779
search stadium blog newsletter

00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,839
everything including to develop a

00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:45,179
regulator your son or the community

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,819
feature of course if you're a media or a

00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:50,309
digital company the internet site you

00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:52,769
want your users to interact with your

00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:54,779
content user to ask question user to be

00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:57,209
able to rank the content ID system

00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:01,739
websites demise it everything is there

00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:04,350
and last but not least third parts

00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:07,199
integration properly it allows you to

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:11,440
actually very easily integrate with cert

00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:15,640
third-party services yeah the services

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,440
and it's already configured and out of

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,470
the box okay so you can integrate with

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,640
any kind of hang on services or would be

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:27,550
important at a tasting have any sort of

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,730
the box of chocolate the complete text

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,340
conversion of course we will talk about

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,530
it the best practice is actually with

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,380
Drupal you have many way to build the

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,270
sensing but most probably you have one

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,620
or two very good way to actually be late

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:47,230
for the maintenance for the test for the

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,730
security patches and this description

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,470
has really been built with best

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,450
practices so if you read the good you

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,320
know that that's the way it's actually

00:11:52,450 --> 00:12:00,370
building a distribution it has little

00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:03,070
exertion integration approach moves and

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,260
pupae basically it really has very

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,760
strong best practices integrated into

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,750
the court order contacts in my grade

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,450
using the microphone draggable Hank

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,310
Burroughs do multi-channel strategy what

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,170
does that mean that means you only have

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,330
a website that you can also have mobile

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,480
application as wrist was talking today

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,950
you don't always have a website if

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,690
you're saying something the user will

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,450
not always go to your website to buy

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,980
what you're selling you can just go stay

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,290
on his mobile and have any application

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,590
or from someone else resetting your

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,720
product and that's what they do is

00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,180
actually publish content that can be

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,970
sold into other platforms ok so the

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,560
channel below you don't actually control

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,640
how your content is going to be

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,620
delivered to the end to end customer

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,750
here is the actually complete list of

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,790
the project description the MK

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,030
distortion you can check that it's in

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,030
English

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,920
and how did they actually did that

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:11,000
desertion the tools that they used where

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:15,230
first Drupal 8 of course why because

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,120
rubellite has a very very nice some very

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,300
very nice features that followed them to

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,089
actually give give their situation very

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,740
fast do is immediately night editing of

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,209
course for publishers you want many

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,190
people to be able to edit the content

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,490
life and test the content and stage the

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,190
content the cash system the very strong

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:38,390
cash system this is a very important

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:40,279
feature for the for media companies if

00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,620
you have a breaking news you don't want

00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:46,209
your you want your users to have the

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,339
news first right if not you're losing

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,990
customers so the cash system of drove

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,440
right which is very very flexible and

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,790
very powerful allow them to actually

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,899
implement and did what they wanted to do

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,790
and as we said the services integration

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:06,470
they also used fastly anyone is familiar

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:10,070
with fasting right so fast means the CDN

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:13,370
CDN is a content delivery network it

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:17,089
basically captures your content and put

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,010
it in the node which is often closer to

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,950
the customer that than your actual

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:25,459
server but the data lives okay so we

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,440
find a customer and I connect to a

00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,329
website which which is using plastic I'm

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,970
going to first go through the CDN

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:35,120
through fastly and request the content

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,829
from there if the content is in the node

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,040
where I'm searching what which is close

00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:41,690
to my enjoyed my nation I'm going to get

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,370
a couple from fast I'm not going to

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:48,279
reach the origin the origin is the

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,899
server was with the back with the SQL

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,120
saturdays and Cortana the actual data

00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:55,490
leave it's almost all the time i will be

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,070
reaching directly fastly as a CDN and

00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,550
the kind of the feature that we provide

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,180
our region

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,399
vertical / to other CDN if you want to

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,720
change the configuration price pull up

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,330
the city and the way you're doing the

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,240
catching all the logic firstly provides

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,950
real-time CDN real-time cm means if you

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,050
do a configuration change it's going to

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,140
spread out to all the nodes of the world

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,279
where they have their notes and

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,709
automatically update the progression you

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,360
don't need to wait for hours for your

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,089
chance to propagate and test your change

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,700
if you're doing that quick fix or what

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,430
fixes or patches to your cash

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,070
implementation real-time CDN is exactly

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,290
which one so they really have instant

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,209
operational units at one very powerful

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,329
feature and they also have the key based

00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:44,610
purging this is super important that's

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:48,510
also related to how to pull eight

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:51,450
handles caching events Persian purging

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,680
means purging a cash means you remove

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,089
everything that is in the cash to

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,339
recreate it from the origin which means

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:03,570
the first users that are going to access

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:05,910
your your server after it has been bird

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,140
will go to the originate going to take a

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,850
while for them because they are the ones

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,149
that are going to recreate the cash for

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,709
every node on the pan okay and when you

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,510
do perching you actually perfect

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,740
everything you cannot say i will just /

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,709
this because that's the only thing that

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,079
exchange okay whiskey best purging that

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:25,740
means fast he has a concept of surrogate

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,320
key and they can say okay I got a

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,700
category of products for example I'm

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,190
saying t-shirt and I'm saying something

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,529
else switcher and I'm only updating the

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,350
prices for example of the t-shirts and I

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:42,720
got to keep and I can say firstly purge

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,970
me all the t-shirts and fastly will be

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,440
able to go to all the notes and say

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,720
remove the content that you have in your

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,730
cash only for the t-shirt I don't need

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,220
to recreate everything that's super

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,829
proper because you can update one thing

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,050
not have the old cash completely rebuilt

00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:01,190
all the time there are preferences

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,190
that's super interesting

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,150
real-time logs and statistics every time

00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,640
something happens on one node of the

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,280
planet where you have your husky notes

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,130
you can see that on your photo on your

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,020
dashboard light so if you have a peek if

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,760
you have something happening you can see

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,580
that life I think others Indian might

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,660
also have this feature place a

00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,300
requirement if you are working with a

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,790
CDN and of course last but not least

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:35,840
it's built partly with false technology

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:39,360
post mins open source three or

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,000
conservator something open source

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,460
software right so varnish is one of them

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,920
varnish is the caching system that a lot

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:52,350
of people said use debit busty l-dopa

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:54,390
barge and used by major websites the

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,750
largest websites actually use fastly and

00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:00,690
last but not least drupal.org uses fast

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,370
so you have many research many rock post

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,220
about it's super interesting report

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,290
already there is a big case study

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,930
explaining why did he choose fastly and

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:13,770
I really encourage you to go on to the

00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:15,330
website and read I just figure out I

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,340
miss some code of site at the very

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,130
beginning and I'm going to go back in

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,450
time show you those lights and then go

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:27,690
back to the tools that's fine with you

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:29,700
guys I hope yes actually yes at the

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,880
ravine robert douglas ask you no regard

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,290
to us he's a was supposed to be doing

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,830
the printout you could not come

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,260
unfortunately and he was supposed to do

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:43,500
that session and because he could have

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,790
become he was like who can be doing this

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,010
session and he went to me and said

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,400
focused on can you be doing the station

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,510
why did he ask me and that's because at

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,650
the very beginning I was the project

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,420
manager of the commerce kickstart

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,930
distortion have you heard about mercy

00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:00,690
sir someone uses so much is it okay so

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,630
first we start when it was out was

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,880
really a revolution and it was a

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,890
revolution in the way of how people get

00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,350
distribution we completely went from

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,320
scratch and inflamed

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,970
complete theme for example for the

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,280
installation profile so we completely

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,380
tricked the station profile we

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,450
completely tweaked the things that you

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,429
could configure from the beginning of

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,380
your website so every kick-starts

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:26,000
installation is completely different

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,850
from one another because you can choose

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,590
the vit that you want you can whether

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,910
you want dat or sales tax you can shoot

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,679
the currency you can choose your country

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,870
you can choose what kind of product you

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,270
want to import you have very complete

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,929
installation steps that you can have and

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,549
we built that decision as using best

00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,710
practices again with the Search API

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:49,460
integration all the clues are indexed vs

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:53,900
Search API admin faces views user place

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:56,480
to use many things are very easy

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,100
sometimes to include works them but

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,960
that's really using best practices and I

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,640
work on that product as a project

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,650
manager when we're still overcast and

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,080
sometime last year I started my own

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,000
e-commerce store and I bill it also with

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,270
e-commerce solution instead t-shirt for

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,390
couple this is my wife here and it's

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:20,090
very well upperside yeah that's why I

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:23,510
wanted to go somehow it's free shipping

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:28,870
mehdi not in india but in forensic free

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:31,070
shipping so in order one feel free to

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,450
they are good with the distribution of

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,679
course i said an article time and they

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,620
are all still on platform essex that's

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,210
the part why we're talking about that

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,380
because those websites are still on

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,140
performance a butt massage is a

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,570
prostitution and that's why i want you

00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:49,520
to go back in time now we can go back to

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:52,039
the tools firstly plus message you know

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,450
such a gross and backer he's working

00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,220
within the system is one of the main

00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:00,080
thought you were to divide i think the

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,179
system provide much beer and they they

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,549
were trying to see how they could

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,309
implement their build this distribution

00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:10,010
using continuous integration continuous

00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,929
delivery and continuous deployment those

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,720
things are a bit different containers

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:17,860
integration means every line of code

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,740
that the developer boot

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,990
is somewhere can be tested consumes

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,000
delivery means every line of code that

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,980
the developer pushes somewhere can be

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,309
tested and validated by a customer or

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,750
you have your l2 actually tested and

00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:34,000
continuous deployment I mean every line

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:38,679
of code that the developer pushes can be

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,510
tested of course but it here and deploy

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,190
Isis that means you really need your

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,240
development environment to look like

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,070
your production because you don't want

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,990
to push something that will look or

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,270
behave differently on your production

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,290
server you want to completely guarantee

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,690
that what you're testing on your

00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,530
development environment really has the

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:59,470
same money and then went to us because

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:02,110
we provide high availability also like

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,580
triple redundancy i'm not sure if it if

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,280
you're familiar with that concept hi

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:10,360
really means every single service

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,429
running on your website is cheap is real

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,710
dump them three times we have three

00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:18,010
nodes running in three dedicated the

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,690
data centers so if one that sector

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,280
completely dies you still have your

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,150
website pony if you want to go an

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,650
upgrade of your website you want to

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,250
change the infrastructure for website

00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,290
all this on the text whatnot is going to

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,690
be the master and you can do the update

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:38,080
and upgrade into the other place that

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,510
our data running so you never never

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,730
never lose the accessibility to your

00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,169
website the website no matter what will

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,740
always be available to your customers

00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:50,410
and because of that we can really up

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,270
size or downsize without taking the

00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:56,350
application online that means if you

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,330
need more resources to your website you

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,309
don't need any dumb time it's not going

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,400
to require any downtime and we can do

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:05,530
that it is pretty important if you're

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,680
expecting a huge peak of traffic because

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:11,490
it's a Christmas thought maybe

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,230
the really matter here but you're

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,590
expecting some big sales because there

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:18,680
is a event coming you can actually up

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,570
sighs your server and your website

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,220
without taking the application offline

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:28,040
let miss you can really test on up sighs

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:31,500
and go back to downsize very easy and

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,380
that's interesting for the continuous

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,870
deployment every thing in the platform

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,490
is get base that means everything is to

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,670
go via get the configuration of your

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,290
infrastructure your content know the

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,560
content not all of the data for the

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,300
configuration and product the poor the

00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,640
application the Semel is everything goes

00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,790
through get together take the system

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,100
internet access your server and change

00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,080
something who is more tweaked out fix or

00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,640
patch and say yeah it should work now

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,170
you need to go through it in its

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,250
redeploy the application but you will

00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:08,400
take the time to time and that's how you

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:14,180
work respect now what was the outcome

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,180
for md system who did that destruction

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:27,300
CU m/d system inside said that actually

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:29,340
that opportunity to build a distortion

00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,310
to santa leaders who are having similar

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,590
issues really took them to a completely

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,270
different level into knowing super 8 and

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:41,640
master interpolate now they have

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:44,840
complete team of developers that that

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,850
notarized one scene interesting about

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,560
this working camp about the NPA

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,560
distortion and i didn't mention that yet

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,110
it's slid between some open source

00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,210
contribution the old motors dual seems

00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:00,760
driver is that i've been built and also

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:04,210
enclosed is a baby so the distribution

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:08,220
itself is not open source we see how you

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,570
can use it but it's not open source okay

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,490
you're going to tell me a the GPL

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,620
license you have to completely open

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:18,970
source yes but we are going to see how

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:21,340
this model can work now their number to

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,380
Drupal contribute there is a page on the

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,320
road which has the best mention earlier

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:29,590
in the energy nuts and NT step is the

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,450
number two contributed by it to Drupal

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,820
in general but that's because of that

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,800
destruction that they built it followed

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,250
them to really master chocolate they're

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,780
really big events now to work with a

00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,320
chocolate project and what was the air

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,950
right the return on investment for them

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:50,080
then now a very p is the user selling

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,770
proposition for too polite and

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,480
delivering your project is right they

00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,660
upgraded all the contributed modules

00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,000
that they own that they contributed to

00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,370
Drupal 8 that's super important a lot of

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,110
companies are going to be stuck with

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,940
corporations that work for Drupal 7 that

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,580
times are going to tell and hey you had

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,250
that for Google why don't you make it

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,530
4-2 by account unique to a great not

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,470
easy to actually a great it is easy I

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:20,380
mean it depends but actually they are

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,970
ready auto of their module and they

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,500
started an internship program so they

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,600
have a six-month internship program

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,570
where all of the interns have

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,030
contributed modules to the right so they

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:34,150
were all working at some point in the

00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:38,470
disruption in the end cap desertion and

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:40,300
they were they were all indeed they were

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,190
all working mr. at the very

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,930
beginning so if you

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,320
internship and you have your chance to

00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:50,810
work early on but I and have some some

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:53,780
contributor to drupal it is very great

00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:58,830
opportunity for you as a tuple developer

00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:00,720
they also have this website which which

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:04,050
I encourage you also to have a look at

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,470
that is not accurate as much now but

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,940
when Drew Blake was in beta or alpha

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,550
this website they were maintaining this

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,620
website to actually check what was the

00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:17,550
status of each of the box video module

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:20,220
that exists for 247 and it status its

00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:23,040
migration studies to Drupal 8 but it's

00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,070
pretty quick because the best have tests

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,350
included so you could find anyone here

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:33,180
for tonight and check whether or not it

00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:36,090
was ready for use for quality and now

00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,650
how do you actually use NP a teacher in

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,780
Jersey you have a very big customer

00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:44,100
major customer that would like to

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,930
benefit from that and use that mph

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,920
solution remember I was talking about

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:51,780
local and look on this big website they

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,370
had three months to actually deliver the

00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,370
product they had a very big deadline

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,230
racial deadline so they went to end a

00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,670
system and they said we have three

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,890
months can you help us do something I

00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:05,160
say yeah we have institution you can use

00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:07,680
it and that's how they actually managed

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,010
to finish the website instrument and be

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,640
like if you want to use it you need to

00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:17,880
pay a by okay

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:22,110
so you pay by NP to the investors with

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:26,790
the original investor and of course the

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:28,740
GPL license which actually forces you

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,710
that first achievement requires you to

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,640
actually deliver the code if you get

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:38,190
your the project built using cheap a

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,980
license so basically when you buy is

00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:43,740
mighty you can you get the code of the

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,280
NP it and then it's a fair partnership

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,290
where you see which says you can deliver

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,290
the cut but you can also keep it for you

00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:54,870
and then keep on reusing and resetting

00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:57,930
it for other in our customs I think

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,420
that's that's small that it as an agency

00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,310
as an agency you can continue contribute

00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,020
the Rope code and a lot of modules to

00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,780
cooperate because of the institution but

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,030
you can also give it you can in the

00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,320
meantime you can give it for you

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:13,920
contribute the modules that you want to

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,210
you want to outsource to open source but

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,280
keep the description so that you can

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,770
improve it and make it better and we say

00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,940
for all your customers that's the idea

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:25,740
and we can talk about it here and yet so

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,050
for now if you want to start using the

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,670
MPX I can show you a quick demo of the

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,010
npad solution at the left should use it

00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,110
but to target if you want to use engage

00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:38,850
you need to contact the MDC's and guess

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:43,680
ok sighs will be online after now as far

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:45,690
as the reflection it's already the time

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,700
to promote super 8 to your customers

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,760
even though some contribution have not

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,830
migrated you should be starting you're

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,570
probably project now because they were

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,210
already starting when triple it was not

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,910
even released now that it's released

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:03,150
it's really time to migrate and go to

00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:05,760
Tobias you should not start new project

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:08,940
now whisper cell that's very good man

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,370
and if you have that kind of big

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,790
customers program you should be building

00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,590
institution I think that will allow you

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,140
to

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,669
use the time that you invested in the

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,620
first project and the money you again

00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:22,940
just in the first project and split it

00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:28,250
into water project that you might have

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:32,659
in the future that is it as it was a bit

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:34,270
shorter than I expected yet that's it

00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:39,559
thank you very much for your attention

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:42,740
now we can ask me anything or tweet each

00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:45,070
you want to ask questions and you have

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,070
to push

00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,759
that's because people

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,679
this distribution

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,630
duty

00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:24,750
the license the same between seven in

00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,750
the break it's the GPL license

00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,950
anyway so the question is

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:56,659
how much you need to ask me on this

00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:57,980
thing is I you can talk a bit after the

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:00,950
distribution is not a purchase if you

00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:07,120
buy it you'll get those social that's

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:10,039
when you get the social if you buy three

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,380
yeah if it was open source Everybody

00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:14,960
wouldn't have existed it's nothing it

00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:19,399
you only the people that pay for it have

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,140
access to its commercial over but all

00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:22,820
those modules like there are 42 not

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,770
those are like you guys contributed all

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,090
that back to the community exactly is

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,799
what I mean like all that you like all

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,980
the components are available exactly

00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:34,760
it's the distro piece so the glue that

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:38,299
puts everything together is not open

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,399
sourced you can buy it to use it but all

00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:42,860
the modules and for the components that

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,590
make this situation happen are

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:48,260
completely available for use okay so you

00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:51,169
have the publishing modules certain

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,450
parts integrations those are available

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,429
trooper on to prorogue ok you can use

00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,409
anything and recreate kind of the

00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:01,789
description like that the thing is that

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:03,799
if you have limited short deadlines or

00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:06,340
meet our constraints you can use that

00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:11,529
description and then confirm it right

00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:11,529
since within that's the best eid ended

00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,010
oh that one has not let all the decision

00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,810
has nothing to do with the instructions

00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:24,780
just posting and that's how they build

00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,430
the decision so they had a one branch

00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,010
for every feature and they were testing

00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:32,460
and pushing a lot of that's the class

00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:43,040
DMC not very developed pebbles you can

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:43,040
really you can

00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:57,240
yeah you don't have to distribute it you

00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,940
can when you're reading a website for

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,240
foreign language reading it the band

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,390
will ask you not to publish because that

00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,790
you wrote really written for him right

00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:10,860
but you you can mystery nothing prevents

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:17,550
you from this video that's your real

00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:23,270
kind of it that's how or therefore that

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:23,270
booth in the main modules yes

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:40,810
the effort of maintaining an assertion

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:42,130
is pretty hard I mean text a lot of time

00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,570
and effort because every time you update

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,929
something you need to test that it's

00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:49,000
still works but if you have integration

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,310
with tests for example and if all of

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,590
your website are shooting from that this

00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,570
version if you test it once on the

00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,130
description or the website you've built

00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:00,220
with that distribution are going to

00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,960
benefit from that time invested okay so

00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,670
here those three websites give the

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,130
improve the distribution they will

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,840
benefit the improvements will be made to

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,600
power of the website so you don't need

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,820
to go to which website and do the tweaks

00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,620
and do the fix is yourself you can just

00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,030
improve the distribution that you're

00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,740
maintaining and pull from so I mean

00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:22,930
readily you just need to do the

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,020
maintenance once you don't need to do

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:28,840
maintenance on all of your customized

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,230
web sites that are built using that

00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,230
district

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,850
really powerful have you guys use that

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:48,660
another project since happy yeah Oh

00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:50,490
muscle power perfect we r platform into

00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,440
the session so we are hosting so we

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,010
probably propose to our customers the

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,620
CDN that is the best suits their needs

00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,880
most of the time we proposed draft

00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,860
phones which is the dead over us amalgam

00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,350
integrated CDN if they need something

00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,690
more like what with a feature that they

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,730
want we propose has been a pain I think

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,310
we're going to migrate completed 34 now

00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,800
prompt is integrating with a head west

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,770
and we're mostly on a device most of our

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,410
customers are on AWS so they get the

00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,470
Gulf Coast what was the line during

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:29,310
shooting past it was that like

00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:33,450
partial cash the two key components

00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:35,730
where the key parking being able to

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,550
first on a specific stuff and not your

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,560
thing and the instance configuration if

00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,270
you read the deposit or blog post that

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,570
we say that before when they wanted to

00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,490
do an improvement or their cash system

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:50,460
which one which one is which one well it

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:52,290
but they took five hours so you do a

00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,940
chance and you need to wait five hours

00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,890
so that your chance will actually

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,830
propagate it and you pray for your users

00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,330
do not do anything stupid before and

00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,980
during that time frame because you

00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,230
cannot control how the cash is going to

00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,960
behave so excite might be unavailable or

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,119
just very very long to load now it takes

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,420
those collapsible for the notes on

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,420
propagate so the architecture class is

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,089
way more perfect terminus en so that's

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,750
the language learning program this

00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:23,520
fastly is the more your page your

00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:28,740
website growth and the more views it has

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,540
the more the price growth so you pay

00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,420
with the number of times views and the

00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,599
number of hits that the CDN actually

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,640
gets so the more viewers are looking at

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,650
the site the more your thing then you

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,550
get more viewers gardening exercise the

00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:48,380
merrier you are so good at the CN grows

00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,380
with this is very powerful

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:56,650
any look where she is

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,650
see

00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:09,750
that's a good question that mean very

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,580
correcting drupal with others I think

00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:17,070
you should first compare Drupal 8 with

00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:20,880
247 yeah so yeah I think the main one is

00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:25,170
the corporation that is that is not that

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,210
is anymore but in the device the

00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:30,000
confusion pies use your staging with

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:33,720
development and for the inline editing

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,060
that makes the barrier to entry the

00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,849
super world that lowers the barrier to

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,010
entry to the forward because it was

00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,900
super hard for user to restart pretty

00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,580
content creating content ID pages

00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,320
everything now it makes things really

00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:50,640
easier so for the UX work and for that

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,349
configuration files which helps

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,570
developers I think those are the ones

00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:58,490
the scenes but then you need to compare

00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:03,020
to the others tools like do now

00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,020
WordPress is harder to compare

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:11,710
more like what you like or the one you

00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:14,410
master you should keep some components

00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,880
of signal iduna but as an end user or as

00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,770
a developer it doesn't really impact you

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,340
it's more on the maintenance of the

00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:24,010
framework we are not reinventing some

00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,960
some parts that that already exist and

00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:29,010
are already maintained by by other

00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,900
committees that's the only it may change

00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:35,950
we're not reinventing that for you to

00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:39,130
play but as an end user I don't think

00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:42,090
you care of matter this helps the

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:44,830
developer tool to get more predictable

00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,620
so somebody is the contribute to the

00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,510
content

00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:50,100
robust exactly do we use something that

00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:56,970
is my thanks I swear and that's been

00:39:50,100 --> 00:40:02,190
tested and there's regrowth yeah this

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:05,100
distribution is this only for sale in

00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,680
the street or rupee are those for which

00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,090
village that's a good question that the

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,540
main part of the talk is not you should

00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:15,330
use the NPA is more you should build the

00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:17,220
distribution using the existing stuff

00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,560
that are available for Table eight

00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:22,380
because if you have I mean those

00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,140
features are really dedicated to media

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,060
and digital industries if you have

00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,000
different use cases or different

00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,160
features you should be at yourself and

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,800
don't forget yourself you should not be

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,310
I think for large concerns you should

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,980
not just be meeting website you could

00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:43,560
build a situation which can be reduced

00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:47,490
then for other use cases in that you

00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,790
have has this little piggy tell me this

00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:58,910
is one instance but

00:40:49,790 --> 00:41:03,770
we're replicated across southern I mean

00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:05,870
we are there any other examples for as a

00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,940
distribution i'm not sure but you should

00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:10,070
really check the LSD program the large

00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,650
scale in shape because that's exactly

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:14,060
what they did and then they didn't

00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,460
really create a distribution they

00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,470
created modules so some very big modules

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,890
used in trouble I've been actually

00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:23,720
funded by computers that had issued I

00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,150
couldn't say exactly night but that's

00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,560
that's how some very big modules where

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,180
we're starting at me so I don't know

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,640
about distribution I know that when we

00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,680
created kick-start it was a dream or for

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,810
a demo store so that people could say

00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,970
hey it's a question do with Drupal

00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:46,900
commerce and then people really started

00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:46,900
