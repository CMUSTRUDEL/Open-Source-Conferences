being when you can just post one comment

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,160
per hour don't be worried it's a

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,610
measurement anupa at work to avoid spam

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,500
so yet the system automatically detected

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:18,240
for a countess older then you will have

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:20,100
the problem I don't know so you can if

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,350
you try to post many comments within one

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,279
minutes like you're looking like a bot

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,779
then true blood work will n Detroit work

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,760
there's some spammer role that you can

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,740
get or that you lose at some point it's

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,020
I'm not sure how it works exactly it's a

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,430
bit of a secret so its members don't

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,210
know how it works on over to work but

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,219
yeah of course triple dog is a popular

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,590
website so people want to publish their

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:48,719
content there because it's good for SEO

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,120
ranking or whatever which also means

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,920
anything that you do for your drupal

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,320
company duper at work keeps your company

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,090
and yourself more visibility so really

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,850
the first thing when you start out with

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,660
Drupal is just create an accountant yeah

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,660
the first step

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,560
so this session will also be a little

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,090
bit developer centric so yeah I will

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,530
show you that the tools that you need as

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:36,479
a developer to get something up and

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:39,960
running on drupal.org maybe in two

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,580
minutes we have to wait a bit until the

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,479
people arrive and until the recordings

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,759
ready are we ready for recording so we

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,990
wait two more minutes to let some more

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,990
people in and then I'm going to start

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:07,890
if you have any questions at any point

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,959
just feel free to ask me just just raise

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,819
your hands and I'm going to repeat the

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,540
question to the microphone so that it's

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,540
in the recording

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,360
we also have some microphones here

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:37,150
checking if they work we have a question

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,340
sir what's the best so far with Mumbai I

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,160
think the food so food is good I'm a

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,320
vegetarian so I live in Austria and the

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,970
options they are limited so it's nice to

00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,140
go to Asia place because they have lots

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,140
of veggie food I like that

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,900
ok I think I'm going to start now so

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,430
that you don't lose a lot of time hello

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,530
everybody welcome to my session this

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,630
will be about publishing a module on

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,310
drupal.org so I'm assuming your your

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,599
developer and you have some kind of code

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,650
and you want to start to contribute you

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,069
want to share something with the

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,250
community my name is Klaus groovey orc

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:37,410
lousy on drupal.org I'm a soft engineer

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,860
at epic oh it's a small company in

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,110
Austria in Europe we're working on job

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,959
boards which means we're using Drupal

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,970
and sell them as job boards where

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,650
companies can post their company

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,690
profiles and post jobs and applicants

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,090
can apply for jobs it's basically our

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,370
business on drupal.org I'm a project

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,130
application review administrator which

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,840
means there's a group of people that

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,519
look at new contributors what kind of

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,530
hope they provide and we review that

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,170
code I'm also a member of the Drupal

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,819
security team so when security releases

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,130
come out we coordinate with the auto

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,650
maintenance and drupal.org and to get

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,510
that out I'm currently working on the

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,970
rules project this is a contributed

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,310
module for Drupal 8 and I'm also a

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,729
maintainer of the rest module in Drupal

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,470
8 core and then I also work on coding

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,539
standards for Drupal so there's the coda

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,220
project which can automatically review

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,690
your code for coding standard errors I

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,460
will also talk about that a little bit

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:39,120
later so much about me so one important

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:43,710
aspect I want to talk a little bit about

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,870
is contribution so we should all thank

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,850
each other more that we contribute much

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,640
that we offer our code to be shared

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:54,210
amongst each others because no one

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,430
person alone could program all the code

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,680
that has been developed for Drupal on

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,240
their own so we all live of each other's

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,740
contribution so this is the most

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,380
important aspect of the Drupal community

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,440
is that we all provide contributions and

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,120
this makes this huge pile of magic where

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,970
it can build actual websites and get

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,440
stuff done so I also want to thank you

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,360
to you all for your future contributions

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,539
this is important for the Drupal

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,610
community as I said and this is always

00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:22,740
the thing that we should focus on when

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,390
we work together that we appreciate each

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,830
other's contribution and that

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,270
make them useful and that we make the

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,350
most out of it so before you start to

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,380
publish a module there are some

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,620
questions that you should ask yourself

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,360
one aspect is duplication most of the

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,010
time when you want to publish code there

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,980
is something similar probably already

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,420
out there so the first thing in order is

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,480
to do a web search do a google search

00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,340
into a certain drupal.org does module

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,840
like that already exists can I work with

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,970
the maintenance that are already there

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,980
can I contribute my coat there because

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,470
if we create many similar modules on

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,570
drupal.org then it means then it's much

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,280
much harder for the users and we all are

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,140
users I'm also searching for modules on

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,850
drupal.org to find the right thing if

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,500
they're 10 lobbyists doing the same

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,060
thing and they only have one maintained

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,560
and they're not working together and

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,740
it's really bad because I have no idea

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,330
which model I should choose so this

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,970
place in today the Drupal community

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,620
ethos of join forces which means we

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,620
always emphasize collaboration of our

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,720
competition in this community you are

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,430
not alone there are always like minded

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,810
people people trying to accomplish the

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,000
same task so you should really work

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,220
together instead of competing and then

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,050
make one module which is better than two

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,790
separate modules that do kind of the

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,710
same things but are not really finished

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,260
so it's always better to combine that

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,690
force then there's also the aspect of

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,370
utilities so when you program a custom

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,980
model for your site it might be very

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,750
specific to the use case of a site then

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,000
that means it might not be that useful

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,460
if you publish it as a project on Drupal

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,440
door because it should be in some way

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,530
generic that you could use it on any

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,510
trooper side for a use case for example

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,610
if you have the organic groups module is

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,560
quite generic it doesn't tell you that

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,120
this is made for a new site or this is

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,340
made for a job website it's just

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,520
grouping content together and providing

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,780
a deuced case there's also an important

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,130
aspect of the Drupal community that

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,870
every model is programmed in a very

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,210
flexible way and can be used for many

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,150
things and also that's the aspect of

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,100
dedication it should be publishing the

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,660
module is not a one-off shot that it

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,670
just once and then forget about it you

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,890
should also think about I'm are going to

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,630
maintain this how what happens if there

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,950
is a security issue and have to work

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,810
together with the security team to

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,850
create a new release so you should also

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,310
think about how you can support this in

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,570
a long

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:42,220
be responsible maintaining so the first

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,860
thing that we have interpreted works are

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,830
so-called sandboxes these are project

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,960
pages that have a sandbox URL so it kill

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,970
it says in the URL that this is the

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,460
sandbox from the user Klaus II and it

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,760
has just a number and it also has this

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,930
experimental warning meaning that there

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,370
is code in there that hasn't been

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,230
reviewed that hasn't been tested it's

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,940
probably not meant for production use

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,910
it's just something a person put out

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,440
there and the most important aspect is

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,270
everybody that has a Drupal at work

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,560
account and has agreed to the terms and

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,150
conditioning that think there's also a

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,740
git repository policy and can create

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,360
such a set box so you create your

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,610
account drupal org and this is where you

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
start with the sandbox everybody can can

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,430
push the code the only thing you need to

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,950
know is get i will talk a little bit

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,450
about that later so a sandbox has this

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,010
project page and it also has a git

00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,080
repository and the git repository

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,690
contains the actual code and the project

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,640
patches is made to describe the sandbox

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,380
what kind of code is in there as we can

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,120
see there are no releases recess only

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,850
for food projects and that's basically

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,680
all there is to a sandbox on the other

00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,990
hand there's another kind of project on

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,370
drupal.org this Accord full project so

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,710
what you can see here they have a full

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,750
name spaced URL which means you always

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,300
have their / project prefix and then a

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,560
short name for a project in rules is

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,850
just rules something that's an

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,430
underscore in there you probably have

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,350
seen this pattern a lot and the biggest

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,850
differences to sandbox is of course they

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,910
don't have an experimental warning and

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,290
they have tagged releases so you have

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,060
some branches and get them then you

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,640
create tags and can make recess out of

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,620
them and all projects on Drupal talkers

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,080
have stable releases like that there is

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,610
also supported by the Drupal security so

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,050
when a security issue comes up the

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,640
security team works together with the

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,200
maintain us to get the new release out

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,540
and creating the so called security

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,980
advisory and telling people that they

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,170
should update and what the problem was

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,810
and how it was fixed so that's the

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:35,080
biggest thing not everybody can create

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,270
food project this is only user accounts

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,380
that have been reviewed can do this and

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:43,330
I will talk about this review process

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,090
but there's also the possibility of

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,710
abandoned project so there are quite a

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,810
lot quite a few a lot

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,300
know how to say that correctly there

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,160
some unmaintained project on Drupal

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,120
adore so in all ready set in the

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,250
beginning when I talked about

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,050
duplication instead of publishing

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,360
something new or instead of publishing a

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,490
fork and you should work together with

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,820
the unmaintained project to just contact

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,200
the maintainer and if they don't respond

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,820
then you just open issue in the drupal

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,500
org webmaster queue and you say hey I

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,850
would like to take over this project

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,680
here is some coded I've written this

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,750
should be replaced in pending webmasters

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,970
will give will transfer the ownership of

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,800
this full project to you so you can now

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,910
work in this project and people should

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,740
do that more and they should work

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,000
together sometimes the maintainer just

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,560
say yeah sure you can work with a

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,210
project it's not a problem and we should

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,420
do this more often so instead of

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,890
creating another project really do that

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,870
for example you shouldn't create this

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,090
plus project at a better projects don't

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,090
create a project like better comments or

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,880
coda plus or I don't know comments

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,380
double plus improved now really you

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,030
shouldn't really do that work together

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,640
with the projects that already exists

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,410
and improved them also they are existing

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,790
users of this food project so when there

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,020
is new code out there they are going to

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,210
test it and they will give you feedback

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,960
you have a much higher visibility to do

00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:00,520
that as I already said you if you cannot

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,900
contact them in 10 if they don't respond

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,820
you can go through webmasters neighbor

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,290
transfer the ownership to you so there's

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,000
a link in there where you can get the

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,740
instructions exactly how to do that and

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,510
these slides are also up at the

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,640
drupalcon website now so you can open

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,380
the presentation from the website and

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,180
click through the slides then you can

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,570
click on the links if you want to look

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,370
this up as I already mentioned every

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,680
sandbox every food project has a git

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,420
repository attached to it so for every

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,340
drupal developer it's very important to

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,590
learn the basics and get because every

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,600
maintainer everybody the Porsches code

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,580
to do blood work has to know get to some

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,220
degree you can either use get from the

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,320
command line you can use it in your ide

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,350
for example in phpstorm wine that means

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,150
you just use it somehow and why do we

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,430
you skipped it tracks the changes that

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,470
you make to your project so you make an

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,210
an amount of so-called commits which

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,100
means that our change sets to your code

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,380
and then you tag a release at a certain

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,660
point and later you find a bug to fix

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,120
that and you might fix another bar and

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,600
then you create a new tag and this is

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,160
been going to be the next release

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,839
every project on drupal.org has a

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,639
version control tab and there you can

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,170
find the good clone command it's

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,449
actually very similar to other systems

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,490
like github that you know every project

00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,980
page that you see has an associated get

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,079
a repository and you find a clone come

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,970
out there and how you give you the

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,819
instruction how to get the code branch

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,040
names in Drupal we usually call after

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:23,959
the major version of Drupal edit the

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,880
code is written against so this would be

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,860
an example for a Drupal 8 code we call

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,839
it a tot X minus the branch of the

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,600
tortured one of X and the tag would then

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,990
look like this and my module is somehow

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,490
ready so I tagged it with 8x 10 but it's

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,769
the first day that's not a full release

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,970
yet and the documentation how to use kid

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:42,500
is actually quite good and drew blood

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,050
work i also recommend you to look up

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,360
that it's essential tool that you should

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,399
use for the project at the publishing do

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,740
at work but it's also nice to use gifts

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,730
for your client projects it's really an

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,810
essential tool finally drupal developer

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,970
another thing that you consider before

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,800
you publish your module is to follow the

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,120
coding standards this is important

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,850
because other people are going to look

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,319
at your code contributors clients people

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,779
that want to do a security review of the

00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,910
code they want to look at it because

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,470
Drupal is of course open source so

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,180
people are going to read your code and

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,130
you need to understand it this is why I

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,269
have come together to set a certain

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:21,860
amount a certain set of standards and

00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,569
formalities so for example around white

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,029
space and indentation how code should

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,620
look like because if we all use the same

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,810
patterns for our code then it's much

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,949
easier to look at another module and

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:36,920
then immediately realizing what is going

00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:38,300
on there and what the module does there

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,949
are also naming conventions how you

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,170
should name your functions for example

00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,910
in Drupal every function that you write

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,470
for Drupal 7 model for example needs to

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,000
start with your module name that's why

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,660
for example in the rules module every

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,310
function will start with rules lowercase

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,829
so these are some conventions that we

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,779
follow we also have lots of document a

00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:58,430
lots of coding standards for inland

00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,620
documentation so many write code you

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,329
should leave comments you should leave a

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,069
short comment what the function does you

00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,779
should give clear names to your

00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:07,819
variables and all of this is documented

00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:11,870
on do blood work in the coding standards

00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:13,209
document so in order to follow that they

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,399
are automated tools that you

00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:18,069
use there is the coda project which uses

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,720
PHP code sniffer and this is a command

00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:22,209
line tool that you can execute so what

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,490
i'm doing here is just invoking the PHP

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:26,199
CS command with the drupal standard on

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,819
some example module and then it will

00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,949
list out all the coding standards

00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:31,720
problems that it finds for example

00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,059
there's a functional commendation

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,009
missing or the opening brace is not on a

00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:38,199
correct line it will also give you a

00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:41,079
hint which of those errors it can fix

00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,790
automatically so coder and peach because

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,189
if i come with the second command which

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,689
automatically can fix your coding

00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:48,069
standards this is really nice if you

00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,379
have some old legacy code and it's

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,910
really not written it's it's hard to

00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,610
read because it uses taps instead of

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:57,129
spaces then you can just run this PHP

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,839
code beautifier over it and it will at

00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,699
least fix that so the code is much more

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,319
readable there's always in a coder

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:05,920
project on Drupal at work so I recommend

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:08,050
you to check that out the same thing we

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,139
have for JavaScript this is done with es

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,199
lint this is a node package so for most

00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,639
wanted developers it might it's probably

00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,139
not a problem to install another node

00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,569
package because they're probably using

00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,610
some sass pre-processing for the CSS

00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:24,189
anyway and they are instructions how to

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,259
install years Linda it works pretty much

00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:29,980
the same encoder it would just read your

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:32,410
javascript file then give you hints what

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,049
you can improve in your code drupal 8

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,420
already ships which has such an es Lintz

00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:39,160
RC config file which specifies in

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,379
JavaScript files you choose you should

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,929
use to space indentation other stuff

00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:45,429
that should be done and on es lintel org

00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:48,100
you find instructions how to install it

00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:49,749
and how to run it so these are essential

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,610
tools that you can run to automatically

00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:54,459
check your coat they will give you some

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:57,069
some important hints and all of this has

00:15:54,459 --> 00:16:00,339
also been put together on a website

00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:02,740
called PA reviewed sh so i wrote the

00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,290
original PA review as h bash script

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,819
which uses coder and it uses es lin and

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,160
some other review tools that you can

00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:10,869
execute locally and then patrick from

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,910
germany put it up on a website called

00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:15,639
paver you reviewed at this age and what

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,559
you do there you just give it the git

00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,089
repo see you RL of every project and

00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,009
then hit the submit button and then it

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,379
will download the module and check it

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,610
and give you a nice report and what

00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,930
coding standards problem they are in

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,880
diff

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,830
so in the project application review

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,140
process where we look at your code we

00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:35,640
use this a lot m to automatically review

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,470
code another important thing to consider

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,899
when you publish coating drupal.org is

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,089
licensing so we want to prevent the

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:45,420
drupal association to get into legal

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,279
trouble and since Drupal is open source

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,279
and it's licensed under the GPL version

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,779
to our code that is pushed to the git

00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,360
repositories on drupal.org is

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:57,420
automatically it should be a version 2

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:01,170
which means you need to be careful if

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,000
you if you have third-party libraries

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,010
that you're using them in your module

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,809
because you are not allowed to push them

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,610
in a git repositories is that you should

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,740
tell you such we have to download them

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:14,790
one example you are using for example

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,949
the amazon web services SDK for PHP in

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,020
your module and don't include it in a

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,970
git repository just tell users here's

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,679
the module and then you download the msl

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,050
PHP library and put it in this place and

00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,030
then it will work so you can also use

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,250
for drupal 7 the libraries api module

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,170
and to include third-party code in

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:34,650
Drupal 8 it's more than the use of

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,840
composer if you're referring to 2am PHP

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,429
libraries but i think the libraries api

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,940
still exists for javascript libraries

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:43,440
that you include in your trooper code

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,000
yes so it's also important if you

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,630
develop a theme for example if there are

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,309
font files or icons images make sure

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,960
that you have the right to publish them

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,460
on Drupal at work because as I said

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,250
everything that goes in there needs to

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,740
be GPL version 2 cannot be anything else

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,030
and this is important if it violates the

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,490
licensing then you need to remove it

00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,429
this is also something that we review

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:09,120
and when we come in review applicants

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:10,890
that apply for food projects so I think

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,540
this is the most important aspect when

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,270
we think about new project that people

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,250
put up security so of course if you

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,620
publish a module it shouldn't make the

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,770
website it is running on less secure

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,630
than it was before so always when you

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,760
develop code always work with it in a

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,290
security mindset make sure that the data

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,820
is protected make sure that the

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,860
configuration that can be done with the

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,300
module is protected in a way that it

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:38,340
cannot be abused or anything else and

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,289
security is also the reason why we don't

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,970
allow everybody to publish food projects

00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,130
under breath work because we have to

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,200
secure the team and the security team

00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,970
wants to support all stable releases of

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,429
any contributed modules but they can

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,770
only do that if we know to a certain

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,690
degree that the people know what they

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,210
are doing so we need to check the code

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,330
somehow we need to approve users that we

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,159
trust them and yeah that's a very

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:06,600
important part when we do project

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,980
application reviews as or is that your

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,960
code the department should not be a

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,419
threat that's why I should security

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,909
review the your own code yourself but

00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,830
it's also a good idea to ask somebody

00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:18,149
else to do it for you and in this

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,669
process you should get a little bit

00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:22,649
creative so think about it how could an

00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,570
attacker abuse your module what could

00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:26,010
they do with it could they run their own

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,260
JavaScript is there a cross-site

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,539
scripting vulnerability somewhere what

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,360
weaknesses does a code contain is every

00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:36,120
path that you have implemented protected

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,350
with a certain permission is the code

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,850
that you have written ready for

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,350
production side doors it's still very

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,700
much experimental and ask yourself also

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,500
are you familiar with the security

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,029
concepts in Drupal so there are certain

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,370
vulnerabilities that you can easily run

00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,919
into and we have some good documentation

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,020
roupa de org to write secure code this

00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,320
is mostly written for Drupal 7 but many

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:03,330
of the concepts also apply to to Drupal

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,950
8 just to give you an overview what kind

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,549
of security vulnerabilities do we find

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,409
in rubicon trip and more than half is is

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:12,179
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,980
I will talk a little bit about that it's

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,620
basically a beck has injecting their own

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,500
JavaScript into your website and thereby

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,600
they can exploit admin access for

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,480
example but there are also other kinds

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,100
of vulnerabilities likes access Piper's

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,679
you forgot to check for a permission

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,100
somewhere or you forget to protect the

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,779
path or you forgot to implement the node

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,760
access tag when you show a list of nodes

00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,529
and this can easily happen so they're

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,659
also quite a few access by person

00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,460
abilities and there are also others like

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:43,919
cross-site request poetry and SQL

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,630
injection they make a smaller percentage

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,450
of the vulnerabilities but of course

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,490
they also very bad i think that the most

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,870
the most that has the highest impact is

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,370
SQL injection if you have death and

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,670
model it's really bad because then an

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,350
attacker can easily modify database in

00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,800
your database which is yeah really bad

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,850
and also other kinds of security

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:07,200
vulnerabilities in this last piece so

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,050
let's look at cross-site scripting

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,500
mostly what is this and many develop a

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:15,960
module and your module might produce

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,360
HTML output and it might access user

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,680
provided variables so in this example we

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,260
have a reflected cross-site scripting

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,970
example let's assume you have a simple

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,790
PHP script not even Drupal it's just a

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:30,300
simple PHP script and you're outputting

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,770
something from the URL and number do you

00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,350
think this is secure but what could go

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,870
wrong here and if you think about if

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,880
anything and attacker can basically pass

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,430
anything in at number and when you print

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,710
it like that and a pecker passes script

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,020
decks like here they can execute

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,910
JavaScript on the HTML page so whenever

00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,450
the pages is being printed to an

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,340
administrator for example then the java

00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,830
script is executed so what would I do as

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,480
an attacker I would send you you are the

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,150
admin of the Drupal site I will send you

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,000
a link with a special number parameter

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,040
in it and when you click Add link which

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,900
we process that prints that out and then

00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,210
in your browser a script is executed and

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,650
that's kryptonite so in this example it

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,210
just pops up an alert which is pretty

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,160
it's not really harmful but it could

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,140
also load some JavaScript code from my

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,210
home page for example and then execute

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,190
executed as you as the administrator and

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,290
for example create a new user account or

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,880
give some other user in an additional

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,170
role so cross-site scripting can be

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,140
really dangerous and you should be aware

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,160
of debt and the Drupal 7 in seven the

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,930
general rule is you should always

00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,880
sanitize user provided text the user

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,040
provided text can come in many forms as

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,440
a parameter in the URL or it can be a

00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,210
note title it basically can be anything

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,040
that is in your database it can user

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,720
provided so it's not trusted so when you

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,100
print something to HTML we need to make

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,500
sure that it's not JavaScript that is

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,950
sanitized properly in Drupal 8 we use

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,750
that the twix rendering engine and it

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,610
has auto escape being built in which is

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,850
really really helpful so I hope that we

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:59,910
can bring down the cross-site scripting

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,650
vulnerabilities 42.8 quite a lot yep

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,050
but there is also cross-site request

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,490
forgery I just show you some

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,140
vulnerabilities and how they can be

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,110
exploited so to give you a feeling what

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,940
can possibly go wrong with your code so

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,300
clustered request for true means an

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,130
attacker can change data without

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,110
verifying the intense let's look at this

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,120
HTML example so we have an image tag

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,680
here and usually you would find that the

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,050
source attribute you would find some

00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,030
kind of image so as an attacker what I

00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,470
have done here I have put in a URL to

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,210
your Drupal site in here let's say

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,390
example of comments your drupal site and

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,040
let's say that a quick delete module has

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,740
been enabled there and it exposes that

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,300
path so what happens if you as an admin

00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,540
go there and you have access to the

00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,220
quick delete em path and you go to the

00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,930
attackers page and the image is rendered

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,390
what the browser will do it we try to

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,520
touch this URL and if there is no CSF

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,500
protection then Drupal will just execute

00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,750
the code and quickly delete the note in

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,000
this example so what we have to do here

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,790
is either use confirmation forms the

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,320
form API in Drupal 7 and 8 and all

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,000
versions has c/s I have protection

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,380
building so it means when you use a

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,090
ghost of the path you have to click an

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,910
additional button so nothing gets

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:12,270
deleted by default or we sue you use per

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,590
user tokens in the URL so sometimes it's

00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,390
nice to have quick links to delete

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,980
something but then we need to do it like

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,300
this here at the bottom we have an

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,490
additional security token this is

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,130
different per user so an attack had kind

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,050
of guess this token and the link will be

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,880
secured and can only be executed from

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,430
HTML it has been printed for your user

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,860
and not on some completely different

00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,860
side or whatever so these are all things

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,050
that you have to think about when you

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,780
take security into consideration when

00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:42,300
publishing a code and do you see the

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,250
pattern here what happens we need to be

00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,260
very very careful about user provided

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,450
data that comes into Drupal it can be in

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,190
a URL it can mean a request it can be

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:52,350
the body of the request it can mean a

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,480
content of the database because as the

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,850
golden rule in Drupal you always do and

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,560
what they use a type exactly so if they

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,780
put in script tags for example in the

00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,310
note body okay that's fine you store the

00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,220
script tags in the database in the field

00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:07,220
but when you render it to HTML you make

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,360
sure that it's been sanitized

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,400
appropriately that's why we never trust

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,690
data that is in the database because it

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,260
could be potentially

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,820
beef on someone that we don't trust and

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,470
what attackers try to exploit is missing

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,630
a week access control so make sure that

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:25,020
your permission set up is configured

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,460
correctly and what we saw here when I

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,350
explained to you cross site scripting a

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,450
cross-site request forgery is that this

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,750
browser features to perform actions

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,130
behind the users back so when when we

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,710
saw the image earlier the browser

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,840
doesn't ask you should I fetch this

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,370
image now no it just executed just

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,930
patches the part and if it's an image

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,310
that it can it can display it but

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,540
otherwise it just will execute the

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,180
request and whatever happens on that

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,580
server happens same with cross-site

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,840
scripting the browser will not ask you

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,430
hmm should I really execute this

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,530
JavaScript that is here it looks a bit

00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,540
suspicious know the browser whatever

00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,520
JavaScript text it finds in the HTML it

00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,920
will just execute it and if an attacker

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,080
managers to inject JavaScript into your

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,640
HTML the browser will just executed they

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,830
won't ask for your for your permission

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,100
so that's that's important that we

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,020
always keep this everything that is

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,450
provided by the user even by app means

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,830
by editors but anybody is not trusted

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,850
and we need to make sure that it's it's

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:22,440
sanitized when we deal with it okay now

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,230
let's talk a little bit about workflow

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,600
how does this is now work on drupal.org

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:30,270
the review process and how can you

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,920
actually put up your code and there is

00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,070
this review checklists a lot of this

00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,630
point I have already mentioned so the

00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,520
review checklist is something that you

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,260
go through as an applicant but then also

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,610
reviewers to look at the code will go

00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,680
through the same things so they make

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,570
sure there is no duplication that the

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,070
module doesn't exists they check for

00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,840
security and licensing those are the

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,400
most important parts but they also take

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,080
a look is there documentation is it

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,210
obvious to use us how this module can be

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,430
used and that's it follow the coding

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,590
standards is the code usable how's the

00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,560
API usage are they abusing something is

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,700
there may be an SQL injection or some

00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,860
other weakness that could be exploited

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,540
and there's also a link in there which

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,460
explains the list so it gives you a

00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,350
point for point checklist that you can

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:15,060
just go through and make sure that the

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:16,740
code follows that then there is the

00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,570
project application queue so on Drupal

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,210
at work we use the so-called issue views

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,970
every project has an issue queue like

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,780
Drupal core has won the big modules have

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,060
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,520
model has one and there's a special

00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,140
project called project applications so

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,870
this is not really a project is just a

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,150
meter cube which is used to track

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,120
applicants so what you do you go there

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,310
and to open an issue and to give it the

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,330
name the name of the module for example

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:47,070
I want to publish the rules module and

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,600
you apply for permissions to create food

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,760
projects with that because when you

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,380
start your code is in a sandbox and now

00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,180
you want to push it up to a food project

00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,860
to have a nice name and have releases so

00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,050
you create your application issue there

00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,580
it's just the usual issue queue and then

00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,140
other people will review or cut your

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,380
code and in the end when everything

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,150
works out you will get approved so how

00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,890
is the workflow you open the

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,050
applications need to view which means

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,520
somebody else should look at it and they

00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,080
will then check out the code they will

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,630
go through the review checklist that we

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,560
have seen before and if they find a

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:21,660
major problem for example they find a

00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,130
security issue the detail oh hey here's

00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,570
a cross-site scripting vulnerability you

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,330
should fix that before you publish that

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,850
then the the issue is set to needs work

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,470
which means now it's your turn to fix

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,510
this problem and when you've done that

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,950
you set it back to this review so this

00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,230
is the standard issue queue back for

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,090
that you might already know from Drupal

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,770
core when we develop patches it's pretty

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,230
similar and the same thing we're using

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,630
here to approve applicants review them

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,970
and tend to approve them and in the end

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,580
and a reviewer says okay I don't see any

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,230
problems anymore with this and then they

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,640
set it to review and tested to the

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,380
community so which means in their

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,940
opinion everything is ready and this can

00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,950
now be approved by AG department and

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,900
then a good administrator this is a

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,450
group of people on drupal.org they

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,400
approve the application set the fixed so

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,050
what then happens is the user gets the

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,850
so-called get better user role in the

00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,250
product work so they have some elevated

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,530
permissions and they can now create full

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,540
projects they can still create sandboxes

00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,430
so nothing changes there but once the

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,320
sandboxes are ready they can promote

00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,570
them to full projects and they cannot

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,310
only do that for one project but they

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,170
can do it for any project in the future

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,570
so this is a one-time approval process

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:29,790
you only do this once you apply with one

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,950
sandbox and when that's approved then we

00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:34,940
trust you which means we trusted all

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,460
future projects that you create will be

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,520
will be secure

00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,750
and good as well and then you can

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:46,399
publish them on your own no review

00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:50,539
process after that of course this is not

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,890
without problems so there are certain

00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,350
things that are not nice about this

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,779
review process if you compare it with

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,820
get up for example anybody can any can

00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,470
publish anything on get up that's also

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,450
buy it should be really careful if you

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,399
download something from github because

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:08,029
you don't know what are the skills of

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,429
that person did they actually is this a

00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:12,470
known person that knows what they are

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,870
doing or is this just some experimental

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,460
code what yeah it's hard to tell on

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,470
drupal.org it's more if it's a full

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,909
project and a chance that it has been

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,039
created by you said it knows what they

00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:23,779
are doing is really high and if units a

00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,059
sandbox then there's a clear distinction

00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:29,240
this is experimental so whatever code

00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:30,940
you download from Dubrow org just

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,710
thinking about do I need to review this

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,659
how many people is this used with the

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,720
most popular models like the views

00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:40,159
module or I don't know the rules module

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,480
they have been downloaded and used so

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,640
many times so the chances are good that

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,870
this is trusted code but if you download

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,399
something which is only one use you

00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,929
might think about whom maybe I should

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,539
look at the code myself to make sure it

00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:53,510
actually does what it says yeah but back

00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:54,679
to the problems that we have one thing

00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,820
is that we are always running out of

00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,649
reviewers so at some point you might get

00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,299
really angry in the interview you

00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:04,370
created your application and it takes

00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:07,250
really a long time nobody's looking at

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,080
your coat some applicants wait even for

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,390
months and they don't get feedback fast

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,100
enough the problem is that we don't have

00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,840
enough reviewers so this takes some time

00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,700
these are all volunteers to do actually

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,250
a Drupal community nobody gets paid for

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:23,570
that and that's why it may take some

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:25,399
time so what people also might perceive

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,559
as unfair is this one time a proof of

00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,200
process so once you have the role and

00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,299
you don't need to get reviewed again so

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,799
people might think this is really unfair

00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:35,299
once the people I approved they can

00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,039
basically do anything will do blood work

00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:39,020
but I have to wait here and I cannot

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,649
publish further modules so people get

00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,970
really annoyed some people are also

00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,590
angry that they only get superficial

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,149
feedback people are pointing out the

00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,760
coding standard errors to make but they

00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:52,060
don't read you the actual

00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,520
finality of the module so when you

00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,410
provide feedback foil a module make sure

00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,540
that we point out yes this module worked

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,640
for me I think this use case should work

00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,590
like this or this is good so you should

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,970
really tell the people about the

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,100
functionality of the module not only

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,540
point out coding standard errors this is

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,130
something we have to constantly work on

00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,780
as reviewers so that we give the

00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,610
applicants a good experience when they

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,040
publish the module after all it's a

00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,690
contribution and as I already said this

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,300
is something that's something very

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:23,740
valuable so we should be careful how we

00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,240
treat the applicants some consideration

00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,160
why are we doing this at all so we could

00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,120
also say why just can't everybody

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,860
publish project but there is the problem

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,510
of spam I already mentioned this in the

00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,700
beginning so there could be some

00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,910
namespace clapping by random users they

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,140
sign up for an account then reserve many

00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:43,150
namespaces and then webmasters have to

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,760
go in and revert that give the namespace

00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:47,650
back so this could just could really

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,870
increase the workload so that's why we

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:52,870
have the process to make this make this

00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,370
a barrier to spam but also we have to

00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,630
secure the TMS already mentioned then

00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,130
they want to support all of all

00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,140
contributed modules that the house they

00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,730
are just have a stable release so the

00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,410
security makes one important

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,780
distinctions this is between stable

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,130
releases and non stable releases

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,410
unstable releases is a beta and alpha

00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,050
version of a module so the security team

00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,480
does not release advisories for that but

00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,610
if it's a wonder Oh or one dot one or

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,200
two to 0 then this is considered to be

00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,490
supported by the security list and they

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,400
will work together with the maintainer

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:25,300
to fix accurate degrees issues in case

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:27,580
they come up I wish the Drupal has a

00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,020
certain reputation so most of the coded

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,180
we have in drupal org is actually quite

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,770
good and most of the contributed modules

00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,450
are also quite good they are used on

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,370
many many sites this is something to be

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,620
very proud of the Drupal community so of

00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,510
course we want to preserve this this

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,240
quality level of contributed modules

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,550
that's also why we consider and having

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,110
this process ends yeah and also

00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,180
encourage collaboration of a competition

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,550
this is forced into the duplication

00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,320
mantha don't don't publish a module

00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,850
without checking ever what the community

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,430
provides so make sure that they don't

00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:00,190
duplicate stuff this this or reasons why

00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,690
we have the current projects but here so

00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,220
what can you do to speed up your your

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,359
epic

00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,460
our problem is that we are lacking

00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:08,530
reviewers so my idea a couple of years

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:12,099
ago is that applicant become reviewers

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:14,799
themselves so what you do is you review

00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,940
other applications so there are there

00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:17,710
are other applicants out that they

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,359
publish you interesting modules you just

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,889
look at them and you review them

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,929
according to our checklist and then you

00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,460
say yes this module works or no this

00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,079
module has this in this problem and

00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,149
after you have done this for three

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,879
projects you give your own issue attack

00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,950
PA review review bonus so which means

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,319
then you show up on a high priority list

00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,690
where I for example as a good

00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:40,089
administrator will look first when i

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,429
when i'm reviewing applications i always

00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:44,079
go to this pack because i don't have

00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:45,790
time to review everything so i need to

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,040
prioritize and of course i want to help

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,950
people that help others so this is this

00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,869
is my high priority list where I review

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,700
applications and it's also good

00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:58,210
experience you can learn really a lot by

00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:00,250
reviewing but you what you can also do

00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,420
is community networking so as already

00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,690
said its community we should work

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,980
together so when you when you want to

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,660
publish cold it's important to make

00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,000
connections to other Drupal estas in

00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,859
your area or worldwide there are many

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,510
channels that you can use you can ask

00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,670
colleagues at your company to review

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,770
your code then you improve their quality

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,510
so you can even work together with them

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,339
on drupal.org you publish the module

00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,109
your colleague reduce it and sets it to

00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:25,900
a QB see this is totally fine it's just

00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:28,510
a second pair of eyes that make sure

00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,740
that the code is good while you can it

00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,970
doesn't have to be colleagues it can be

00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,730
friends it can be other community

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,829
members you can go to local meetups make

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:39,069
connections there you can go to user

00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:40,930
groups but it's also on the internet IRC

00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:43,240
we use the internet relay chat protocol

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,619
so there are certain and channels where

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,680
the Drupal community meets online you

00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:48,940
can also go there and try to to find

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,309
people that want to work with you

00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,190
there's also Drupal answers on Stack

00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:55,930
Exchange where people ask questions and

00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,430
your model might be the perfect answer

00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,349
to a question so it also makes sense to

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,880
post it there and the important thing is

00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:02,710
just to get visibility to to your

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,380
sandbox and then what people will review

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,940
it and you will get approved faster it's

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,069
also always good to communicate about

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,799
your projects or maybe write a blog post

00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:13,660
about it and posted it on social media

00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:14,430
just get to work out so that people know

00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,589
that your work

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,000
listen want to promote this and also

00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:20,640
have to contribute and make yourself

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,359
known so in a cropper community you will

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,980
and you will you would just be known and

00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,690
people we trust you we're starting to

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,910
trust you we want to work with you so

00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,380
this is a very good process everybody

00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,140
should really do community networking

00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,720
because we shouldn't work on all we

00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,160
should work together we are using each

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,700
other's code so it's important to work

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,190
together what are the benefits of

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,200
reviewing so yeah you might want to help

00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:48,720
another applicant so what what is in

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,369
there for you so what you can really do

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,869
value on trooper by reviewing code you

00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,700
see what other people are doing with

00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:55,619
Drupal it's the same as see as if you

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,750
look into the source code of topic or

00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,720
you see ah it's done like this this is

00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,890
very interesting now I know how it works

00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,690
the same with other project if you

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,339
review them you can maybe point out even

00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,900
mistakes you can say now usually in

00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:09,599
Drupal we do it this way you did this

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,160
way but it has a problem you learn about

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,900
alternative ways people are very

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,030
creative so when they publish new

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,710
modules they have really interesting

00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,750
idea how they are doing things and you

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,309
can learn really a lot for that and to

00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,900
learn how to analyze for a code you

00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:24,240
learn how to read your code which also

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,670
comes in handy if you are having a

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,400
Drupal job and you would like to review

00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,869
code from your your colleague then it

00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,089
helps if you are already familiar with

00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:34,680
that you also learn how to write secure

00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,839
code because if you look at the

00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,910
application list you will see people

00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,740
pointing on security issues and then as

00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,150
another reviewer you will see I haven't

00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,430
thought about that that's a good point

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,960
you learn about best and worst practices

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,099
you learn what people do right and what

00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,170
they do wrong and how it could be

00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:53,069
avoided so whenever you write the next

00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:55,079
module it helps you to do it right you

00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:58,020
also stay on top of what is new and hot

00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,359
and which means there are a lot of

00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,640
interesting new projects posted for

00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:05,460
certain use cases that are coming up for

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,319
web trends for example any new third

00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,609
party services that might pull up so a

00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:10,440
lot of interesting things in the queue

00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:12,270
you basically see what what people are

00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,609
working on and it also helps your own

00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,290
Drupal curry if you think about it most

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:18,299
of us are professional drupal developer

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,119
but maybe you haven't started with

00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:23,849
drupal yet so this is a good opportunity

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,080
to review other people code engage with

00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:27,090
the community and maybe

00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,630
then Landrieu Patrol I always recommend

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:32,520
it to people so i'm new to drupal i want

00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,260
to work with it and I don't have a

00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,150
drupal job yet this is a perfect

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,090
opportunity to work with other people

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,310
and help mentoring and being mentored

00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:45,930
and then it's easy to actually get a job

00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:48,330
in Drupal so how can we improve this and

00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:52,380
rupal org overall and there are some

00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:54,150
plans that people are working on and of

00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,560
course we want to make the experience

00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,270
better for the applicant so currently

00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,920
they have to wait a lot it takes time

00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:03,420
until the year they are reviewed and

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:06,240
what can we do about this the plants are

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,830
that we automate the that we integrate

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,950
the automated reviews into Drupal at

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,410
work itself so we saw APA review website

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:15,630
earlier this is an external side it's

00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,310
not that nice it would be actually cool

00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,960
to have a code review tab on every

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,840
project on sand boxes and full project

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,280
so that you can go leon's your report

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,890
Kota has been executed on this this and

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:31,170
this other problems I can just fix it

00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:34,170
here and the plan is also to give every

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:38,340
non get vetted user the rights to

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:39,690
promote one sandbox so you push a

00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,790
culture sandbox and then you can

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,620
immediately turn it into a food project

00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,600
but you can only do that for one sandbox

00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:48,210
until you are not approved yet so this

00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,580
is the goal is to bring people up to

00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:53,250
speed sooner so that they can get code

00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,860
out sooner with full with food projects

00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,900
and releases although they cannot create

00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,490
stable reason so that they can push out

00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,500
the first beta or the first alpha

00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,420
version of the module and people can

00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,060
already download that and they have the

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,430
visibility and people know about it and

00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,780
they have a better experience so there's

00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,970
no as i already said there's no security

00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,650
team support fan stable releases so for

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,990
the security team that wouldn't be

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,460
changing much and you would have your

00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,170
beta release out there and then you

00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,570
would go through the approval process

00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,690
after that so instead of giving a

00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:26,220
sandbox for review your now giving

00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,810
providing a full project for review and

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,700
then people will just review that

00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:31,980
otherwise the project they're processed

00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,660
is the same so you get revealed once and

00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,070
once you've got that you can publish as

00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,799
many modules as you want it basically

00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:40,719
means we trust you now so there's also

00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:42,459
issued to track this on drupal.org where

00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,319
people are currently working on it as I

00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:46,359
said this is just a plan it hasn't been

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,039
implemented yet so there is a community

00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:50,219
initiative on drupal.org to make this

00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:52,359
happen and basically we just need to

00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:54,729
implement certain permissions so that

00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:57,189
users can publish this one sandbox and

00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:58,779
then get started sooner they're a couple

00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:00,429
of sub issues in there so they

00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:03,009
specifically list what task needs to be

00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:04,839
done and Jeremy Thorson is is leading

00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:07,269
the effort I think he also created that

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,369
issue so if you want to help with that

00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:10,779
if you are want to implement something

00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:17,109
for Drupal at work that's also the place

00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:20,529
to get started yes and get involved

00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:22,299
overall is a good a good idea anyway so

00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:24,309
there's a group of reviewers and groups

00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:25,900
that drupal.org that do code review and

00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,819
the project applications issue queue and

00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,249
those are not only give administrators

00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:32,650
but those are regularly reviewers that

00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:35,709
post the stuff out there one interesting

00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,299
thing that you can also do if you become

00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:39,400
a little bit experienced in Drupal you

00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:41,229
can become a get admin yourself so the

00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,420
process is not really difficult as soon

00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:45,640
as you are a regular reviewer we were

00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,650
just get in contact with you and if if

00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,900
we see that you do good work if you

00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,299
bonus points if you find security issues

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,949
in in in project on drupal.org then we

00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:55,569
know app this person's really knows how

00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:57,099
to read the code they should be a get up

00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:59,650
in themselves and then they can approve

00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:01,269
users so this is just a list of people

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,329
that do that and they always want to

00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:05,559
pull it new and people so yeah just talk

00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,650
to me if you want to get involved with

00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:10,660
that as we already talked about the

00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,269
Drupal of our fans there is there are

00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:16,089
many tasks now that people can help work

00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:17,709
on and there's also another way to get

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:21,249
involved at other coats prints on Sunday

00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:23,439
so people will gather and work here at

00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:26,019
this event at rubicon on Drupal core

00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:27,489
they work on contributed projects they

00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:32,709
work on documentation all kinds of

00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:34,209
things so you don't just you don't have

00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:35,619
to get more of the code reviewing but

00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:38,199
there are many many many topics in

00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,789
Drupal you can get involved I'm an

00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:43,599
active in code review so I'm also happy

00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:46,420
to help you out getting both there so I

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,009
think that's it for now I made it a bit

00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,920
quicker so that we have time for

00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:51,710
questions yes we have about eight

00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,990
minutes

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,180
for questions anyone so here's a

00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:59,020
microphone it's if the questions short

00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,020
that just repeated

00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:14,339
I was guessing that it's on just put it

00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:16,890
closer I was guessing that Ken Drupal

00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:19,109
review process can be used with the help

00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:22,380
of platform message with the help of

00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:25,469
what platform Varrick form platform

00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:29,549
essence I don't know black form what's

00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:32,400
that black car platform dot sh you how

00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:34,919
the hosting company yeah it has a very

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,630
good day review process ah i see no i

00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:39,719
don't know about that but it would be

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:42,199
interesting so what do they review let

00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,640
just like the peer reviews uh huh

00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:47,880
anybody can review any core like that

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,650
huh can we implement that yeah I think

00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,479
it's already implemented at PA reviewed

00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,130
of SH and there are now plans to

00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:55,829
integrate the automated review that

00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,539
coded us into drupal org so that's one

00:43:55,829 --> 00:44:01,619
sub task of the plans that I've been

00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:04,160
talking to do that yep I assume that

00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:07,319
platform got SH does the same thing I

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,939
mean is that a PA review compatible with

00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,089
some other repositories as well or it's

00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:13,469
only works with gig no it only works

00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:15,059
with kids at this point in time

00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:18,319
everybody should be working with get

00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:24,170
everything else is a waste of time

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:25,849
I mean even don't use the get yes yes if

00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,920
you are you still using subversion for

00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:29,599
example or material or anything else you

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,979
could really do and get because it's a

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,279
tool that is going to be used everywhere

00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:37,599
on drupal.org and also on other projects

00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:40,779
yep i highly recommend the head so sorry

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,779
anyone else

00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,270
ok

00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:54,029
so the matrix like number of installs

00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:55,229
and downloads admins most of my projects

00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:57,359
are like long-term projects and I

00:44:55,229 --> 00:45:00,719
usually disable update manager so that

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:03,660
this word means the code stay stable it

00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,039
might break with the new version so can

00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,410
we immense is there a plan to have a

00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,630
flag or something which I can just go in

00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:12,089
and say that this project works for me

00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:14,039
because if it is not working I can

00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:16,380
easily go in and create an issue but if

00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:20,609
it is working to have a matrix like this

00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:22,619
is working no it's a good idea I think

00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:24,150
people have talked about this very often

00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,130
Drupal at work that there should be some

00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:29,400
star rating system or some feedback for

00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:31,019
users or just a flag and so that people

00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,029
can indicate this is working for me or

00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,650
not but currently no currently you are

00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:35,910
it's not implemented yet I don't know

00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,849
what the current plans for that are I

00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,739
think it's on hold so what you can just

00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,419
look at is the amount of installs

00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,890
basically if many people have this

00:45:42,419 --> 00:45:45,959
module installed the chances that it's

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:52,849
actually working is high but of course

00:45:45,959 --> 00:46:00,630
it always depends on your use case yes

00:45:52,849 --> 00:46:02,309
yes yes it's still a good indication

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,939
because you must have to spin up many

00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:17,939
many instances to just to create false

00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:24,929
data production yes yes then it would

00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:28,829
count five times project life project

00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:32,489
URL or project name yeah could be

00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:34,949
possible so that becomes more of better

00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:36,689
metrics because if I am trying to enter

00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:38,339
the site name there are five developers

00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:40,949
there tried trying to enter the site

00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:42,779
name twice it says that okay that

00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:48,239
project is already been added in the

00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:53,059
list mmhmm yeah would be an idea any

00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,059
more questions there is one

00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:02,790
this is regarding github you have good

00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,220
can we have the sandbox and github you

00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,690
get that there is no distinction because

00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,460
I'm get up everything is prefixed with

00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,620
your user name or the organization you

00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,560
are working for so Drupal a dog it's /

00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:15,990
project / name on get up its / your

00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,520
username or / organization and then

00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,900
search the project name so I'm get up

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,790
there is no the things that's why I said

00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,200
be careful with the code from github

00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,330
because you don't know how many people

00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,220
are using that how secure is this there

00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,990
is no indication on Drupal a dog you at

00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,210
least know this is in a sample so people

00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,100
mean that this is experimental code if

00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:34,800
it's in a full project at chances that

00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,960
is actually stable is higher ok then

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,700
there's another question see so we want

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,940
to have two separate things so is it

00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:45,390
possible there's a way to move code from

00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,980
github to this yes it's totally easy so

00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,180
what to just do with their get your

00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,130
local get your post your chest add

00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,680
another remote your clone from github

00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:54,180
then the remote origin is github then

00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,740
you can add another remote you call it

00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,900
triple at work and give it the correct

00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,700
URL you find it on the version control

00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,670
type of your project and then you say

00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,350
get push to the other remote and then

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,900
just pushes Euler commit and then it's

00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:08,610
just a complete mirror of the same it's

00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,900
a mirror of Dakota github so what we're

00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,700
doing the ruse project we have a mirror

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,530
on catopsa using poor request to work on

00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,560
rules but the code is also sings to

00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,270
drupal dork so that they recommend agree

00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,530
it's some one way to do it so the most

00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,030
important stuff is that the code is on

00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,440
tupolev work because that's where you

00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:25,170
create the releases if you have it on

00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,340
get up you or not it's your choice so

00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,190
because you know your friend a lot of

00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,710
users and developers on github so if you

00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:36,060
have a active project yes you could

00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:38,550
actually have a mirror of it inside the

00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,570
gate drupal yes or would you recommend

00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,010
other way around where you have an

00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,500
active project inside because the

00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:45,240
collaboration would happen more freely

00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,640
on Gator I'm just guessing it probably

00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,080
it's it depends on the droid the Drupal

00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,520
community is mostly entrepreneur work

00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,930
because the issue queue is much better

00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,730
than on github so you get that you

00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:55,260
cannot say something to needs work only

00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,910
their maintain of the project can do

00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,310
this so there's no workflow if you match

00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,870
in Drupal core is 30,000 of issues maybe

00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,340
would have done and get up people would

00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,200
go crazy because you can find anything

00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,850
uber talk you have better filters that's

00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,050
why people use to borrow thought because

00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:10,860
the issue queue github is sold

00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:14,340
mitted near thanks so I think we have to

00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:18,090
start let me check they are one more

00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:20,090
question excuse me I am a question I get

00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:22,770
the point that you have described

00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:26,130
benefit of reviewing actually there is a

00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:28,320
point that learn how to analyze foreign

00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:31,350
code yes I didn't you get this point

00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,990
actually it means if we look at other

00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,970
people's code often it means you develop

00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:38,160
a skill to analyze foreign code for a

00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:39,630
means not your own so if you look at

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,370
another project it's not their own code

00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,130
and you do that very often you see

00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:46,200
people do it like this and that person

00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,330
did it like that you can compare it in

00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,790
your mind how people do things so it's

00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:52,110
the kind of practice you get and it also

00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,550
helps you with your own programming

00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:55,200
skills if you have seen many approaches

00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:57,270
how people do things it helps to improve

00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,240
yourself that's what I meant with that

00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:05,480
thanks okay thank you i'll be out for

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,480
more questions thank you

00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:27,119
