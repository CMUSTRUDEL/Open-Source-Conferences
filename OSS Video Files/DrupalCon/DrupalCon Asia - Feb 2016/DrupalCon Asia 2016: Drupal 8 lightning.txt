all right look I'm Jacob and probably

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,309
met a lot of you before and some of you

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,309
excited to meet today I want to preface

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,619
this talk by saying that you've been all

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,699
fooled this is not my talk at all I

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,070
actually inherited it from a colleague

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,529
of mine who actually runs this program

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,570
at aquia and he was unable to come but

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,310
it's actually an important topic I think

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,529
kind of interesting and we until he said

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,850
hey Jacob you do this instead so if it's

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,190
bad you can blame him and if it's good

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,840
you can give me credit okay and I will

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,640
have a couple people coming and I think

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,410
our could probably enjoy other questions

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,640
so let's make this little collaborative

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm going to pass the mic around and

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:53,399
figure out this is not working what's

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,190
going on here that's odd arrow keys

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,160
aren't working it's even that's not

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,960
working oh there we go okay now as you

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,760
in advanced it at once so we there's a

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,369
lot of metaphors people use to explain

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,320
open source right and Drupal how many of

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,430
you how many of you are an open source

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,360
developer okay the rest of you what are

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,619
you doing here and how many of you are

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,330
open source developers how many of you

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,220
go to parties wow that's great well done

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,820
and then when you go to the party

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,740
everyone else an open source developer

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:35,869
generally not and so when they ask you

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,869
what you do what do you say

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,430
software websites anyone else and what

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,689
if they're what if they really like you

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,590
and they want to get to know you and

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,640
they're like what do you need software

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:51,270
websites what does that mean exactly

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:53,460
then what do you say yeah brand websites

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,289
did it be like what's interesting about

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,860
your company or your field then then

00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:01,950
what do you say nobody nobody tries to

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,270
explain their work to anybody yep a ver

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,530
doing free stuff that's a great answer

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,269
what else how do you describe Drupal to

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,340
somebody doesn't know but it was if

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,510
someone says to you the triples open

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,290
source then how do you guys make money

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:21,290
what do you say make life very simple

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,290
okay

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,260
right so I think we hit across an actual

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,340
problem here it's very hard to describe

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,770
what you do is a lot of times we use

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,080
metaphors for that for instance is

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,690
anyone hurt that open source is free as

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:43,790
in puppy there that one what is free

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,790
isnt bubby mean yeah

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,290
right the puppies free which is still to

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,020
take care of the puppy that's part of it

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,930
one of the metaphors we often use as

00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,730
anyone heard of like a public road like

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,160
a rail system or something right we all

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,840
we all need the road so we shouldn't all

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,130
each own individual blocks of the road

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,810
we should just build a road of everyone

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,410
to use right I'll bite Commons and all

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,180
that but what is the most common

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:16,350
metaphor you've heard to use explain

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:18,790
Drupal before Legos ok now I know that

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,500
Legos are super popular in the US and I

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,370
think they're properly here now I don't

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,990
know if they were when everyone here was

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,520
a kid who here played with Legos and

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:28,330
they work kid raise your hand please so

00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,800
I know that's it so who here knows what

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,210
Legos are Wow ok well to explain what

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,280
light goes on are you guys really you

00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,850
really don't know what Legos are you

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,810
never seen Lego that's surprising well

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:46,270
okay back up so Lego is a it's a set of

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,800
it's a set of like plastic bricks that

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,680
you can snap together to make just about

00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,240
anything so you can it's got wheels and

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,350
it's got little flags and there's all

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,940
different colors all different shapes

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,620
and you can snap them together and they

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,870
stay together really well if you build

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,730
spaceships or cars or what have you

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,600
whatever you want to make that's what

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:07,750
Legos are and why do we say that that

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Drupal is like is like Legos well one of

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,210
the reasons is that it's got a lot of

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,460
parts right drupal's got tons and tons

00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,780
of Bart's we call those parts modules or

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,890
themes or the things where there's all

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,010
these different parts you can assemble

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,360
get this huge box of parts you know it's

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,890
not just one or two you can't just pick

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,180
red or blue or black you can pick every

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,350
color in every shape there's so many

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,080
different ways to do things there's a

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,370
lot of parts if you use those parts in

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,830
the wrong way you can really hurt

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,110
yourself very badly that's another thing

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,570
about your pole just a little Legos but

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,410
the most common reason why we say Drupal

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:44,380
is like Lego would be what no I guess

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,520
what you raise your hand are you

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,150
distracting

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,009
right so what the main reason we say

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,020
that Drupal is like Lego is that you can

00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,150
build all kinds of stuff with it you can

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,770
build you know all different types of

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,710
contracting of contraptions and all

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,930
different types of you know cities and

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,120
forts and cars and whatever with it and

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,500
similarly with Drupal it's not limited

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,810
just one type of application I'm

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,759
building a certain way it's not like

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,020
word word is what where does the word

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,430
processor it's always going to be a word

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,310
processor it'll never be a spreadsheet

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,319
program it'll never be a Wikipedia you

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,490
know thing whatever and then dribble you

00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,810
can make all kinds of things with and

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,430
that is fantastic and there's a million

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,569
ways to do it there's a million ways to

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,240
build it you can snap all those pieces

00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:31,060
together and create anything you want

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:34,720
and flexibility is awesome okay what is

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:40,240
it and if you agree with that statement

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:43,539
raise your hand please okay and if you

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,319
are a programmer raise your hand the

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,900
same answer this is you the program

00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,569
represents this is the IT buyer in an

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,729
organization someone who who has to be

00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:56,289
responsible for making sure that we can

00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,210
build things efficiently and fast and

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:02,110
keep them running insecure for a large

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,880
enterprise or any enterprise and and

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,279
they love flexibility that's really key

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,310
to their to their job that makes sense

00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:15,099
I'll ask another question how many of

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:20,469
you can drive a car okay how many of you

00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:24,880
can fix a car even like oil changes

00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:28,500
spark plugs one or two yeah cool because

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,500
my cars outside I'm going to change

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:35,479
okay and and how many of you would

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,880
prefer to buy your car or build your car

00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,560
how many of you can build a car yeah I

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,880
don't think anyone this room can build a

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,570
car so when you look at that you think

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,560
building a car no that sounds cool but I

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,540
got other things to do with my time I

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,100
need to get to office my job is not to

00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,979
build cars my job is to get office

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,840
that's the business buyer and

00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,340
organization that's the marketing head

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,110
or the sales head or whatever who's

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,970
responsible for getting results out of

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,090
the software that's being built in this

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,979
person they don't they may appreciate

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,350
technology they may be very technical

00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,490
themselves but their job is to put the

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,470
right content in front of the right

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,199
people at the right time that they do

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,669
something the organization wants buy

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,990
something sign up for something tell

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,389
someone about something whatever it is

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,100
that's their job and and building

00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,750
software is a nightmare for them it's a

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,400
huge distraction your job is to get to

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,510
office your job is to go on a date your

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,699
job as you to Grandma's house is the

00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,820
weekend building a car will be a huge

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,130
distraction for you and this brings up

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:40,229
we call the bills vs by sort of argument

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:42,180
and the build versus by problem one side

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,479
we have it's flexible and the other side

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,310
is it's easy and we can't just solve one

00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,570
problem it's not enough to say that one

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,610
of these guys is wrong they're both

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,419
required for the organization and they

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,910
both have their needs which are relevant

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,729
so how can we figure out a system

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,500
wherein there's something out of the box

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:05,370
that will will solve the goals of the

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,080
business user that has is domain in mind

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,720
understands this problem does it solve

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,639
them at the same time being flexible

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,900
enough that you can enhance it that you

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,729
can build upon it that you can create

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,440
other things with it it's a flexible

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:22,039
system anyone have any ideas how do we

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,039
do that currently

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:31,039
no answers distributions yes okay so how

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,409
many of you know what a distribution is

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,820
okay how many of you have used one and

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,219
how many of you use one on like every

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:44,670
project you do well that went from like

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:46,589
50 to 20 22 so distributions have been

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,209
moderately successful at solving this

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,380
gap but not always getting there a

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:56,040
distribution for those who are not aware

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,290
is we take you know you have core Drupal

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,589
core and you have a site in between that

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,680
you have a distribution layer so

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:06,720
distribution is core plus a bunch of

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,730
modules you use all the time and some

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,160
configuration to stitch them together on

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:15,300
top of that you build a site that's how

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,920
it's typically worked and now you know

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,660
and then you can translate that into

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,870
multi sites if you have to produce

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,980
multiple sites a lot of big enterprises

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,410
don't produce one site they have a

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,850
distribution which may be like a good

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,560
insurance company might be a

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,839
distribution called the insurance

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,310
representative distribution and every

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,860
insurance rep gets a separate site but

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,880
it's all based on the same distribution

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,649
or something have you it's a lightning

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,620
falls in their lightning user

00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:46,529
distribution for Drupal it's a set of

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,600
pre-built modules to configure to work

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:51,540
well together that you can build on top

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,769
of one of the key design differences

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,810
though that we thought about with

00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:58,560
lightning as we said we want to make the

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:02,579
best content authoring experience in the

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:06,180
industry not just dribble right and we

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:07,410
know that we don't know what best is we

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,790
a talk we are not going to figure out

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,110
what best is if there even is a best

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,120
because every organization works

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,220
differently we are not a marketing

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,279
organization we are much more than Giggy

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,430
IT guy with like the CC the C colon Brom

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,550
coffee mug and we probably would not do

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,899
a great job of it so we like to do was

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,279
to say hey there's going to be this base

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,959
and then there's going to be enterprise

00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,880
customisations on top of that that we

00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,400
can expect are going to come and on top

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,100
of that

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,290
build sites so we're trying to build a

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,210
distribution distribution as it were and

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,740
provide a lot of really clean really

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,140
well-built components that's it

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:45,970
underneath the enterprise customizations

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,520
Evan with me so far yeah okay a little

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,990
more specifically unless theoretically

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,990
you know what what problems are we

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,160
trying to solve enlightening mmm I think

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,750
these are problems which are plagued

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,680
useful for a long time we're sort of

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,390
trying to tackle the most difficult ones

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,090
we're gonna fall layouts so layout is

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,730
something we're both of the block system

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,560
was traditionally very inflexible panel

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,450
system is incredibly complex and heavy

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,790
and trying to be somewhere in the middle

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,580
where a marketer can just say okay the

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,810
bop bop bop my page done put it up to

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,640
market no that's something that has been

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:23,320
hard to achieve in Drupal today workflow

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,850
pretty good in Drupal today to be honest

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,620
some of the things that aren't there

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,330
though is if you want to preview

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,880
multiple pieces of content to publish at

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,880
the same time that's been a challenge

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,080
traditionally maintaining multiple

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,540
revision trees or content can be a

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,640
problem at times so that's what we're

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,900
focusing on again the preview thing I

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
just mentioned seeing how the site will

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,110
look assuming that we published four or

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,960
five things at once configuration

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,300
changes as well media handling that's

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,940
kind of a difficult scene in Drupal with

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,260
which I'm partially responsible for but

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,910
anyway that's a separate thing about

00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,910
embedding content and bedding rich media

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,590
from other sources you know and then of

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,390
course the other bottom layer below that

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,740
we're also looking at things that are

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,210
really important to enterprises and

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,890
having those pre built in making sure

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,760
that we have automated testing that we

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:11,560
have good security layers etc and

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,210
without further ado I've given you the

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,100
reasons behind lightning we can do a

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,280
quick Q&A now and then I have a demo

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,260
video that was produced by the head of

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,120
lightning team who's not here moser you

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,060
came late this is not my talk I'm

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,330
sitting in for somebody i made the talk

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,680
but it is program so i'm gonna show

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,880
they'll demo video but any questions

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,620
before we do that take a break yeah okay

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,290
everyone ready to fall asleep a little

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,260
after lunch watch a movie sit back in

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,090
your chair turn on the lights all right

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,140
let's see a video and we'll talk a

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,430
little bit shows a little bit of pee

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,020
this is still very much a work in

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,210
progress it's still a beta sort of

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,450
product at this point we're making a

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:56,110
demo of a site which is trying to sell

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,670
drones and we're making a we're going to

00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,740
create first we're going to create some

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,140
content we're going to create a article

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,080
blog post on this site about a different

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,830
kind of drone and you know for that

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,920
we're going to do a little bit of

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,690
content so I apologize that this is all

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,610
about bacon and I understand that droop

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,800
that India's twenty percent Muslim

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,080
population this is made in America and

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,730
wasn't my doing so we use this thing

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,830
which is full of baking words like lorem

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:25,120
ipsum and to be paste it in here we're

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:30,910
going to show up at the media handling

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:33,040
so how we add rich content this is

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,140
Drupal 8 yes lightning is Tripoli yeah

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,040
sorry about that so we go to a YouTube

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,140
video and this is not a cooking show

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,960
this is exactly how fast how long it

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,540
takes to do things we're copying the

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,520
YouTube URL and then we go the media

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,690
library we can pick existing media or we

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,670
can paste into the embed code from

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,770
YouTube and we can say save it to our

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,010
library to use it later and that will

00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:59,440
embed it right in the middle the post

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:02,110
and now we're going to again create a

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,290
new bed now we're gonna put a new

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:09,100
here this one we're gonna upload from

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:12,070
our from our hard drive you just drag

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,160
and drop it in there and again we want

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:18,460
to save that to my pony use it later and

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:22,680
then finally we're going to want to add

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:25,330
some social media to post so see that

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,560
over here we're going to Twitter we're

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,740
going to find a tweet that we want to

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,430
add from New York Times so we copy the

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,430
tweet URL

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:41,860
and are you back here again for the

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:44,230
embed just paste it in and it gives us

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,730
that nice in bed this is built for

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,740
weather services in its a pluggable

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:53,860
system so their social networks can

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:57,040
follow see what's up yeah i think it is

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,110
own but i'm pretty sure but again Q&A is

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,570
probably not i don't have all the

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,220
details I'm not family but I actually

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,570
one of the guys is in India works on

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,740
this team is actually going to come here

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,900
in a few minutes and you'll be able to

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,220
give you a lot more information go and

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,620
so that was created piece of content

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,300
this is creating a landing page it's a

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,980
landing page being a more complex page

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,200
around a specific topic with its own

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,280
layout its own different blocks of

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,650
content I Nicole so here we're going to

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,090
be adding some blocks in this case we're

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,320
using just standard to the drupal blocks

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:36,430
they were built the same way with embeds

00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:40,150
and we adding another block and he gets

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,550
around doing the video block again just

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,810
built using a standard drupal block with

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,210
a video in bed just like we did it

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,250
earlier put that in our different region

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:52,330
so the different regions for the layout

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:54,400
of the page and then here we can see how

00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,330
we can hope he's changing the layout

00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:04,210
right we're going to add also a

00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:08,410
Instagram block so this one is in second

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,970
comes to it right and so this is a way

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,260
to lay out quicker you can pick

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,480
different layouts and change the layouts

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,490
on the fly and all the content will be

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,280
position and then you're also able to

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,440
then resize it'll be responsive here

00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,150
we're going to add a list of district

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,600
tweets from Twitter this is a live thing

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,610
we can use this pulls straight from

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,980
tweet entities using the view system an

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:33,570
entity system so we can we can pick

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,570
those and say we want 5 tweets to show

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,820
go in a second

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:46,690
I'm another call to action thought about

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:52,860
there we go and the sights now the page

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:58,600
is done or maybe it's not done sorry

00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:00,250
alright so that's pretty much all it

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,960
takes to to create a landing page it

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:05,110
looks like this this is stock lightning

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,250
out of the box right now and yeah the

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,630
whole thing is responsive all the

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,510
layouts which is pretty much more but

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:14,500
your blade thing but it also is part of

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,880
lightning as well pretty cool so we're

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,189
getting we're getting there I think it's

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,500
looking not so bad right it's closer

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,089
than I thought when I thought I don't

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,510
we're like at work flow a bit and how we

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,980
handle revision and moderation so this

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:33,130
is back to our original post here we're

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:35,700
going to edit the draft and we quick

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,700
change here

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,880
don't we then

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,950
and that came from the media library so

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,780
we had that tweet in your media library

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,270
which I think it's kind of go up to sort

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,070
of Jewish creature now we're saving it

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,840
as need to review which means it's a

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,130
workflow state none of this is

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,630
particularly revolutionary this is

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,490
really the same kind of stuff you saw in

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,890
Drupal 7 for the most part but it's not

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:13,120
working interpolate thanks the lightning

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:14,440
team and now we're in editor review you

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,910
get an editor can come in here see a

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,400
dashboard everything that needs to be

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,870
approved the editor can go in and

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,340
approve it or send it back and give

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,340
comments on the word flow state

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,630
but then after its published you know

00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,280
assuming if there's anything that's

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,830
that's wrong with it the revision

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,690
history is is maintained and anyone can

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,100
revert back to an earlier version again

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,070
no no this is particularly revolutionary

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,360
but you know in Drupal 8 things are

00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,670
still work in progress so some of this

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,470
stuff it didn't exist a month ago or

00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,810
what I've heard you once ago is now not

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:09,600
working thanks to the efforts so think

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:12,420
you should efforts here but a sort of

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,460
more interesting one is probably Israeli

00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,840
scheduled update so here where we're

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,270
doing this and we're saying that we're

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,460
going to want to release this content

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,660
only on a given date which obviously now

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,450
is in the past but not when this video

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,890
was made so we're saying that when the

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,590
time comes to this we want to change the

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:35,220
state to published that goes into system

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:36,600
and that also works now and that's

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,560
pretty much it I mean that's the demo we

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:47,770
have right now so any questions about

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:50,830
that or what's that

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:54,130
oh I don't know the exact count of

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:57,040
contribs i think i think they say the

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,320
team is upgraded like 20 or something to

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,610
date it's around there right now i'll

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,290
get you the team in a minute and like

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,870
who all is involved in this and how it's

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,580
happening this is this is a contributor

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,400
if I merrily like to team that gap Boras

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,350
on is the octo team and they're all full

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,240
time working on Drupal core so it's like

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,700
five or six of them and they only work

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,920
on Drupal core and solving zar the

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,720
biggest problems there this this team is

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,740
specifically focused not just on

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,200
contribs base so designing but upgrading

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,240
all the contribs making them secure are

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,640
making adjustable and making them pretty

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,720
and work well and and work well for

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:39,640
customers so one of the one of the

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,470
reasons that well we ask you this when

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,660
we went from moving from 20 people who

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,970
had used a distribution to to use them

00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,940
on every project what is the Delta there

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:52,320
why is that not happening while it will

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,320
not use distributions on every project

00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:01,539
become bulkier okay anyone else too

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,429
rigid brasília so too rigid meaning they

00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:05,500
have one way of doing things talk to you

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,760
any other way they're not like Legos

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,470
it's more like an action figure that you

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,210
behind the store it's a chop of his head

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,649
to get anything else on it what else I

00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,799
think those are the same sort of things

00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,799
yeah

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,320
right because your undoing you're trying

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,330
to undo so many things you have code

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,769
that that's maybe conflicting with your

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,179
code only when you didn't write and you

00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,519
can't really maintain very effectively

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,600
and all that doing your own thing so I

00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,889
think yeah past a certain point of

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,590
complexity distributions can be

00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:40,720
difficult and so we tried to think about

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,309
that differently in this case again so

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,889
we made a huge to focus on automated

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,480
testing one so we said if you upgrade

00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:48,730
the modules cleanly from seven to eight

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,110
with roughly the same functionality as a

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,630
first step and we should make sure they

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,340
have great testing behind them we use

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,590
behavioral driven development to use B

00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,059
hat for that and those tests are run on

00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,980
a regular basis we make sure that each

00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:02,200
individual unit works really well by

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,549
itself as a unit so they're not heavily

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,950
couple Abhishek with others you know

00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,120
another another one is our sort of

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,590
philosophy around there should be a

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,570
toolkit it shouldn't be a specific

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,769
experience it shouldn't be that we're

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,049
building a distribution meant for a

00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:18,580
particular person in a particular use

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:20,649
case exactly it should be more of a

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,860
toolkit and we're hoping that makes it

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:26,019
that keeps it lighter you know in Drupal

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,700
8 we have autoloading which also helps

00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:32,470
with code bloat it's not as much of an

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:36,549
issue perhaps you know end of this when

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:40,269
I had here and we're also trying to do

00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:42,519
this it's such a way where we were

00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:43,750
working with the community more as

00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,309
opposed to trying to build a solution

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,529
for customers we're really focusing on

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,700
just improving the controls as they are

00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:50,559
in the ecosystem and letting other

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,539
people build those customer centric

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,429
solutions on top of them it's a big risk

00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:58,090
for aqua but i think you know we'll see

00:22:54,429 --> 00:23:00,490
how it goes and you know i think it's

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,529
it's ready now like you can use it this

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,909
is a bit of a beta we don't have sites

00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,250
in production with lightning yet but you

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:07,450
certainly could start building on it

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,279
like I said it's really just a very

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,830
light layer on top of core and very

00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,080
commonly used contribs so rather than

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,429
tracking your own Drupal 8 and all those

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,200
could drip modules did you need any way

00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,850
following a lightning project is

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,860
probably actually really good move right

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,600
now i think it's it's certainly going to

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,840
be stable enough to do that again it's

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,700
all about testing in fact it can be a

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,100
good guideline as you can do drupal 8 a

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,659
lot of you probably are wondering which

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,230
modules can i trust which ones are ready

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:34,450
how do i get

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,100
started we're trying to provide that

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,240
guideline to the community so that you

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,500
can just follow lightning and say

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,480
whatever is enlightening and the stable

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,340
channel is going to be stable to build

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,200
on or if it's not stable right now i'll

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,480
be told it's not stable and i know that

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,250
it will eventually become stable so you

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,500
can start using that for your projects

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,270
and all of this was built by a program

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,350
we call the Drupal 8 module acceleration

00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,880
program or a d8 map we have 15 that's

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,000
actually not quite accurate i think it's

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,309
like 12 something full time aqua

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,020
engineers who are dedicated to this just

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,179
doing this so all i do is upgrade

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,520
contributed modules and refine the

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,900
usability and do testing on them three

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:21,460
of them are in india one of whom is here

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:22,960
abhishek on then yes and and so the sari

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,820
and that's what we do with in aqua and

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,200
then it's the larger team we put

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,020
together over half a half a million

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,460
dollars in grants which we are paying

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,299
community members to work on their

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,250
projects so examples of that are like

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:38,950
we're the good examples that very kind

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:43,830
of field yeah workbench rules following

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,830
rules no yeah

00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:51,790
yeah okay the multi version module you

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,830
guys are getting paid on top of your

00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,320
jobs do that not bad you guys getting

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,960
paid on top of your jobs to do that are

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:06,160
there I thought I thought we had a rule

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,870
that we're gonna allow that so but one

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,750
thing they didn't demo here is the full

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,240
site preview stuff yeah we actually

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,130
gonna in and this is shameless plug very

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,530
sorry but this session in this room

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:21,190
right after this session we're going to

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:22,840
talk about the multi version module add

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,150
a few other modules you're not gonna

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,800
demonstrate it within lightning but

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,970
lightning is going to use these modules

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,800
in

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:34,630
for food side 3 as so for those of you

00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,000
interested in that in regards to day

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,780
work Loki's here might be just in

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,920
joining the session equities so you guys

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,780
if you guys you don't know it's like

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,220
full site review means I think it's kind

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,720
of maybe a new concept for some people

00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,310
it means that like you saw the

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,810
scheduling one where I said on something

00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,670
such a date I'm going to publish this

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:55,450
article right imagine you do that with

00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:56,860
20 different articles yeah how can you

00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,840
see what the whole site looks like on

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,310
that date right what does a change look

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,410
like you know not just previewing one

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,360
but peeping the entire site or say I

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,770
show different content for users if

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,570
they're from North India or south india

00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,190
personalization how do I see the whole

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,050
site in one side of the others like that

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,270
kind of thing that right that a good

00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:21,160
yeah not quite why I wish I said I wish

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:25,050
it was better ok if you have 20 diff not

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:28,780
course with images and text everything

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,270
the entity specific previous system

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,330
becomes

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:36,020
he is yeah so we using a set of modules

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,370
to tackle that problem space and we're

00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,050
going to go through some of them and

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,880
some additional modest are not really

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:44,240
hope you can you next session in this

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,800
room to check it out it's a really smart

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,500
guy and you always have good tension I'm

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,370
sure it'll be good anyway yeah and so

00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,020
that's what we're that's what we're

00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,550
doing i think it's a it's a really

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,710
exciting project i know for the team in

00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:59,140
india it's a really exciting project to

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,760
be a part of and i think it's a it's

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,200
scary maybe for AA quia we're spending a

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,380
lot of money on this on top of

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,000
everything else with the octo team but

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,400
but but you feel like it's necessary for

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,170
us to to kick-start all these things and

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,610
really get a first edition of all these

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,100
modules out there and something we can

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:18,500
build on and a big part of that is your

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,270
participation so we really need you to

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,580
test this out we really need you to try

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,020
it out in real-world scenarios we need

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,850
you to get involved early and make sure

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,800
that we do it the right way that it

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,140
becomes really a best practices toolkit

00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,390
for how to build sites in Drupal and we

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,420
need your feedback we need it now and

00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,980
later as a continual basis so please do

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,560
check out lightning go for the download

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,360
and try it out to build a little test

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,000
project see how it goes feel free to

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,620
write to me but even better you can get

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,680
in touch with John Kennedy who is the

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,150
the Lightning product owner you can find

00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,000
them online or you can on the product

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,580
page for lightning and with that I think

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,850
we'll just go into QA okay thanks

00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,850
everybody

00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,270
and I think for QA i think i wish i

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:07,170
could come up here and answer the

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:09,680
questions that way but it does anyone

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,680
have any questions

00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,020
the hands is

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,980
but the bass beat your brains so you

00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,980
guys

00:28:53,549 --> 00:29:00,330
you know I think you okay sorry so is

00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:01,379
that so his question is you know drupal

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,850
as a product if you create a

00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:04,950
distribution is essentially a product

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,539
and you have multiple instances of that

00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,059
product so you work for Stanford I'm

00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:10,980
guessing so how could I guess and so at

00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:15,389
Stanford they have a base distribution

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,379
they say that every departments or your

00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:18,840
high wire or something I don't know

00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:21,779
anyway ok so anyway tips are like you

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,039
have 11 sort of template for what every

00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:25,169
department looks like and you create

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,039
different instances of that and the

00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:28,049
problem is that each of those different

00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,730
departments can go crazy and make their

00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:31,169
own thing and so how do you maintain

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,109
some consistency while allowing

00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,749
flexibility right question I don't know

00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:37,679
exactly sure you know the answer that

00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:40,649
question you've done that you've done

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:47,789
this a lot try to do this a lot when I

00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:50,179
have some ideas but no job what does

00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:50,179
come on up

00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,170
we have it we have a similar problem

00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,990
where where I work as well and there's

00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,870
definitely not a very good answer to it

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,430
and especially not in Drupal 7 that

00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,570
becomes very tedious with features and

00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:14,910
features overrides and things like this

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:17,520
we've put I think the place where we

00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:20,220
work we have we have hundreds or maybe

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,150
almost up to 8,000 instances of the same

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,710
distribution so for us at least I'm not

00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,690
sure about your specific use case but

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,410
we've lived a lot of automation and a

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:34,110
lot of tools to discover where people

00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:36,060
have overwritten over any things so we

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,950
have lots of process going out to each

00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,540
and every side figuring out okay what

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,730
are things that are overridden and then

00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,740
it just comes down to human

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,840
communication to sort of solve these

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,540
things there isn't necessarily good

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,050
technical solution to this in Drupal 8

00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:55,590
i'm not sure but discoverability and

00:30:51,050 --> 00:31:00,030
documentation and and introspect

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:01,770
abilities that were yeah I becomes part

00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,030
of that and then it's a conversation of

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,040
what should be included in the base

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,580
distribution should not be move your

00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,380
override to different module can we

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,090
that's how we solve it I'm not sure so

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,610
we did a lot of automation to discover

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,190
when and where and then be able to

00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,500
document around that why was this

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:22,840
documented you know lock this or

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,700
whatever it lucky okay

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,710
he works for Pfizer so that's the thing

00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,450
but I you know when i was i was on the

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,860
drupal gardens team early days now is a

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,720
kind of a similar problem but at a

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,670
different sort of level of complexity

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,809
and scale and other sites are less

00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,790
complex than what you're dealing with

00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,890
their less customized but there's a lot

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,270
more of them so when you have sixty

00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,280
seventy thousand sites to upgrade and

00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,680
you're upgrading your base framework and

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,630
they're all run by different people i

00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,700
mean some of them was like somebody who

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,350
walked dogs for living somebody was a

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,730
dentist somewhere somebody had a weird

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,990
porn site they put up you know there's

00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,920
all different types of people from

00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,630
different walks of life they can

00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,429
customize it over they want they can't

00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,320
write code but they can still do a lot

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:01,250
of damage with configuration how do you

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,250
know that upgrades not going to break

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,720
something one of the tricks we did which

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,600
of course is something the only large

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,420
enterprises could do is we wrote a suite

00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,580
of very basic tests for things like

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,440
logging and logging out great piece of

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,059
content creating a view and viewing the

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,820
view or whatever just very basic stuff

00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:22,040
and we take about 50 or 60 reference

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,260
sites we knew to be fairly active users

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,840
and we took a random sample of another

00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,040
50 we automated every bill we release

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,720
we'd run all those tests against their

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,950
sites it wouldn't catch everything but

00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,630
it certainly caught a lot more than we

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,450
had expected so they would break very

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,830
simple things sometimes and we cut

00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,110
screenshots and stuff so we did some of

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:43,309
that stuff I mean you know didn't always

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:45,429
work though that's one answer anyone

00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,429
else

00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,700
then

00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:58,659
one more insight to to the problem space

00:32:54,849 --> 00:33:00,190
data with Drupal 8 and I think the

00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,919
community still experimenting a little

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,599
bit with environment specific overrides

00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,269
and I think it touches the same problem

00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:10,299
space with site-specific overrides and

00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:14,859
so on there's a very there's a very

00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:17,769
useful functionality in the cmi system

00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:19,569
of the config system interpolate where

00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:21,909
you can do full import of comfort

00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:25,059
configuration but then after you can do

00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:28,119
partially import of configuration so if

00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,979
you google for Dave Hall he has written

00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,619
a blog post on the environment specific

00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:35,379
cmi configuration where he suggests like

00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:38,159
a layered import of you first do fully

00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:40,239
import of of the full configuration

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,949
which also then deals with like

00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:43,989
configuration that need to be deleted

00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:46,329
and things like that and but then you

00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:48,489
can do partial import so you could

00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:50,349
structure your git repository to say you

00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:51,969
know it's the base distribution and

00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:53,469
here's you know the partially in push

00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:55,869
that you need to be able to do on top of

00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:57,690
that so Google for Dave Hall and

00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:00,459
environment specific configuration

00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,389
you'll find this belong there that's

00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,549
some of the things that we are

00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:05,199
experimenting with at the moment for for

00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,889
managing that type of problem space in

00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:07,889
Drupal 8 as well

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,970
if anyone has any other questions I was

00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:17,010
going to just talk a little what the

00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,540
modules been working on I'll try get to

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:24,000
list up what's the password do you guys

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:30,720
know do this got it thank you let's do

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:32,880
it in the round AJ AJ AJ 2016 ok so what

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,500
one is I mean I wish I don't talk a

00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,550
little bit about the what the modules

00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,540
you've been working on are the teams are

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:42,000
working on so currently in India we are

00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,690
a team of three people myself the guy

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,600
called Naveen and need to I don't think

00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:52,170
I can find those guys in the room so we

00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,880
three have been working on we started

00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:57,480
with a module called auto auto log out

00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,190
and that has an RC 2 version what we

00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,040
generally do is we take the module from

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,500
whichever state it is and and take it to

00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,050
a release candidate and after that it is

00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,520
up to the maintenance to get into the

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,110
stable version so that's what we have

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,630
been doing we have put it auto log out

00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:15,630
we are parted share this and now we are

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,520
working on ultimate cron at the same

00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,130
time secure pages secure pages is

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,580
interesting because I think Gabor would

00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:25,110
be able to talk more about it the

00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,720
functionality has been removed from the

00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:30,870
core and the in the contributed modules

00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,640
we are trying to replicate the switch

00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,740
functionality which switches from HTTP

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,570
to HTTPS so that is an interesting

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:40,080
problem that we are trying to solve and

00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:42,210
if anyone is interested your Chi is most

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,640
welcome to join us and help us with the

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,340
work that we are doing so that's pretty

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,260
much it so three people we have in last

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,130
two months two and half months we have

00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,930
ported almost three-and-a-half modules

00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,170
and they are not more to come we have a

00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,520
Search API and facet API are the couple

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,850
of other modules which we are going to

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,560
pick up in next month in March I think

00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:07,840
that's the time when you want to get

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,230
those modules and stable release

00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,970
and I think so front of you even I mean

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,590
who aren't working at all quia it's

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,810
still all of our Drupal we all need to

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,160
do this right awkward did you get a lot

00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,960
but I mean you can also do your own

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,570
thing and if you're looking to gain

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,760
experience in terms of working in the

00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,740
community and building reputation and

00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,420
building skills this is a really good

00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,770
opportunity to do this if you follow the

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,510
Lightning project and you find out the

00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,710
roadmap start looking at those modules

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,560
because you know they're going to get

00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,910
very active maintainer ship from some

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,160
very serious maintainers or actually

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,450
paid to do it which is amazing and so if

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,740
you get in that issue queue you're going

00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,930
to get responses quickly you're going to

00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,340
be able to to get involved in projects

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,290
in a way which I think will work really

00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,660
well for you so consider that also is a

00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,190
budget but not all the projects are like

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,720
entity in bed or feel like field

00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,370
collection really complicated abstract

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,150
stuff some of them are very simple as

00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,380
well so just a little plug there all

00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,640
right let's give any other questions I

00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,500
guess we'll close the other one is Randy

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,270
you out I don't I don't know what it is

00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:12,460
I'm just getting drupal.org / project /

00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:13,870
lightning just like we all are this is

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,890
next month right panels vandalized our

00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,890
search api facets

00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,630
here's the here's the development team

00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:29,550

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:33,500
