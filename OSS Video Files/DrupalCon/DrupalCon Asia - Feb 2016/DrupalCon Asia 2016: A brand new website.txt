so far so how many of you are from

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,420
Mumbai actually mumbai mumbai RS a lot

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,730
of people coming from outside different

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,210
part of india as well as outside go

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:20,460
india good so right off of the lunch huh

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:25,320
everybody is quickly I'll try not to

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,400
bore you that much we fell asleep like I

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,660
think we have to with just one more

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,660
minute before we start

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,679
no positive experience out of the box

00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,390
and media management with Drupal 7

00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,039
interpolate the media module is there

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,809
and there couple of other related

00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,940
solutions which really helped us to

00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,659
manage all the media we can upload

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,070
images drag and drop put in videos

00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,680
whatever we like to do we can do and

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,750
it's very very powerful and with as3

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,379
integration you can even just export all

00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,210
your media into into amazon cloud and so

00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,979
it's very very powerful it's very hard

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,320
to replicate and in reinvent the whole

00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:13,600
wheel again in some other system so in

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,610
and communicating to third-party api's

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,159
enterprise integration which comes in so

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,590
your drupal back-end can still talk to

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,440
many api's and can get you data from

00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,289
them securing user data for sure in

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,360
tuple is very secure we as a community

00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:30,490
work very hard to make it say keep it

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,920
safe so whatever we are saying is saving

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,479
we make sure things are behind the lock

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,470
if they are supposed to behind a lock

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,659
and it it helps put that lock in and

00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:44,740
then securing user stuff because that

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:46,990
could be another wheel to do structuring

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,820
content types and taxonomies so we take

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,759
these things for granted when we are

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,640
actually a drupal developer but

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,219
taxonomies users content types when we

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,990
look into it as as prospector of website

00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,090
building they are so easy in Drupal and

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,380
they are right in the core and we get

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,659
that functionality out of the box

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,549
creating new content types economy is

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,459
defining defining relations between

00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:11,620
things that is much easier than any

00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:13,510
other framework and it's all you I base

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,989
so that is very powerful tool while

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,150
while building different sections or of

00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:23,890
your website here or or even your mobile

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:27,010
app so decoupled way like is it really

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,140
successful so to prove that like NPR and

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,630
Netflix are the biggest d couple

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,160
examples in the whole world NPR's

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,170
back-end system that powers a lot of

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,359
different different systems it's a it's

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,579
been there for 12 years and they are

00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:45,400
really happy about it and Netflix as

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,870
well they they they built a p.i system

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,760
which feeds to all their different kind

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,360
of app syncs all data from all different

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,950
app it's just a just a distributor

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,140
some they have built as micro service

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:03,610
layer so what results we going to get

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,680
like out of it like a great front end so

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,560
you can use your favorite front and now

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,150
any framework you like in UI and CSS

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,560
JavaScript based you can you like

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,290
bootstrap you just take bootstrapping

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,050
you did you use as many components as

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,720
you need and you just use that in your

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,670
project if you like a new framework like

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,290
bourbon just use bourbon whatever

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,300
framework you like you just define and

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,520
use it you don't have to wait for a new

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,080
theme to come in in triple just don't

00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,180
have to make your own theme compatible

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,040
with it and just to make sure that every

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,750
damn element in the whole CMS is working

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,900
with it you find the elements that you

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,280
need and that's it that's what you need

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,430
you will get great front-end great

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,680
websites with responsive design very

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,709
fast angular footprint is very

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,090
introverted small and the angular single

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,920
page applications the websites that

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,620
you'll get a very very fast and

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,540
responsive with ionic as well it I Nick

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,790
is the only framework that can compete

00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,360
with a kind of like compete with like I

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:04,380
sent 9200 in competition with the native

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,820
UI that you get for iOS and Android and

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,709
with angular you also get angular

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,840
material design so which is again a very

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,670
very large framework on top of it you

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,500
can use that in your products and you

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,290
can get material design implemented out

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,700
of the box and not much to like don't

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,240
have to deal with drupal theming at all

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,070
and it will just work out of the box you

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,060
can build mobile apps as I described the

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:30,460
ionic and that will help you ap is that

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,860
you gotta build out of your old rupal

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,930
site that can power multiple systems in

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,060
your enterprise that you can build

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,520
mobile apps you can build different

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,740
desktop apps whatever you like you can

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,419
build out with them what or whatever are

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,220
your needs are so you have a clean set

00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,840
of api's because you will be defining

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,360
them for your site you will have them

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,240
and you can even make them open so the

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,250
other people can utilize and build upon

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,770
them or integrate those things into

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,490
their existing systems and the other

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,610
teams can be can use those as well

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,569
easier up groups for sure now that your

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,330
core could stay really small

00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:11,990
a lot of modules and and dependencies in

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,149
your Drupal or about about the theming

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,149
or about the user interface of your

00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:20,479
project so once your core is protected

00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:22,009
your core is small you can even a like I

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,619
won't say like skip them but like you

00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:27,020
can even skip small upgrades even small

00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:29,479
security patches so if you want to put

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,490
your website behind a VPN and just

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,099
expose the feeds that you need you don't

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,110
even need to upgrade them like you

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:37,580
should i will say but like there is no

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,229
urgent need to operate them because

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,809
nobody can reach them then if you put

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,999
them behind a VPN your only your company

00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:46,069
can access that you already at

00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:48,589
putting a lock on top of it on your on

00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,300
your aps and only you know how to

00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:52,580
communicate with them you go in you

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,949
login your VPN and you make changes to

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,589
your content and everything much secure

00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:59,629
so easier upgrades don't have to worry

00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,639
much about it or sweat about it as oh my

00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,349
site is going to down go down my users

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,839
data is going to get stolen out of the

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:09,439
box today so those kind of fears can can

00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,719
go away and that helps a lot be that

00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,339
this was like easier upgrades and this

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:16,430
this is like a really good selling point

00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,499
if you tell me we have done it in fast

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,509
like this is this is the key because

00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:22,669
like at overnight when we get so many

00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:25,639
security upgrades like the whole

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,229
enterprise shaken off by last year we

00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,539
had couple of big security upgrades came

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:31,729
in Drupal which were really urgent and

00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,619
so that made so add a lot of people

00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:36,319
because overnight you have to make the

00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:38,300
deployments and sometimes deployments in

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,039
enterprise is not that fast it's not

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,269
like I'm going to give them my deployed

00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,129
code and they're going to put it in like

00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,479
three hours or two hours even they have

00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,699
it should do they have to follow they

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,879
have different things in pipelines so so

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:53,289
those things if we can protect and get

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:56,569
some timeline on it that is much better

00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:59,269
faster development cycles that is i

00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:01,069
think is again very important you are

00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:03,409
dealing with two different teams here

00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:05,509
the theming team can work on their own

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:08,149
and the back end theme can provide those

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,800
stuffs in the api's so they are

00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:11,629
independent they are not much dependent

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,819
they are dependent but like not not much

00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,529
dependent theming team can still work on

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,769
the UI that

00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:20,019
need and he that will that will

00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:22,059
definitely run into faster development

00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,349
cycles and it's a much lesser amount of

00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:33,099
code that you will be writing this week

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:37,019
as well okay it's not all right in the

00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:39,699
park there are some problems as well so

00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,339
talking about like what what what issues

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,629
you can have a decoupled rupal oh so

00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,299
very first is like you lose

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,369
multi-language so out of the box you

00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,319
lose it you can still implement it you

00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:53,709
have to reinvent little bit in angular

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,539
or by your api's so you lose

00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:58,389
multi-language which is already there in

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,519
Drupal and they took our core team works

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:04,689
very very hard to get that support in

00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,309
Drupal and it's prob 78 every every

00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,619
Drupal you just make it multilingual

00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:10,959
whatever you want the way you want you

00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:13,179
have to reinvent that in in doing it in

00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,949
your in your new website the angular or

00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:16,449
the mobile apps that you are writing but

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,879
it's still possible it's just extra

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,589
amount of work that you have to do

00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,419
accessibility we if we add a lot of

00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:26,079
accessibility features to our mock-ups

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:27,759
in Drupal out of the box and those will

00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,949
be lost or you have to learn them and

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,250
implement in your code again that is

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:36,250
another thing that you will miss

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,189
rebuilds layout management's like with

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,509
panels and think like panels on display

00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:42,789
suit you you can just drag drop

00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:45,459
interfaces once you have things set up

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,279
you can just push one block on top and

00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:50,730
bottom so that will be gone you will be

00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,050
dealing with HTML lives and then part of

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,149
HTML so you may have to rewrite your

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,970
layout management or just define it in a

00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,379
way so it could be used better I will

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,720
discuss that later on like how you can

00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:03,160
do a little but little bit and how you

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,189
can define templates in your code and

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,660
still use them in your neutral site but

00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:09,699
like you have to reinvent that which is

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,589
already there with panels but it's much

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,809
complicated so I think it's some cases

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:17,980
it's much better to get out of it then

00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:21,309
to be deep inside of it accessibility

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,230
improvements made to core area data and

00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:26,009
and schema.org attributes which were

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,579
added in Drupal 8 that will be gone and

00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:31,670
like it's important of you

00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:34,249
organizations and people and you have to

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,019
do it yourself in your HTML then so

00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:38,059
reinventing the wheel again you can

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,040
export them with your data but it

00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:42,529
doesn't produce very pretty outputs

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,910
there so you have to think about it how

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,439
to how you want to do handle that in

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,230
your project it may or may not be

00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:53,149
important in your product but a Drupal 8

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,410
does that all ready for you so

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:55,819
discussing a little bit about Drupal

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,519
architecture like what will your

00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:00,799
requiring your Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 site

00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,399
to to do it to have an angular website

00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:08,540
oft of it then what does it make sense

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,309
for us to what to use so you can do it

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,529
with Drupal 7 or triple 8 what I am

00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,239
writing here but basically you can do it

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,920
with with your Drupal 5 plus website

00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,989
even in Drupal 6 the service is what

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,589
you'll exist so if you have old Drupal 6

00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:24,499
website you can still use that and you

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,999
can you can use services or any data

00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,069
source we use data source module to

00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:31,160
export out the Jason feed side feed them

00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:33,499
to your different systems restful module

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,689
is very popular in Drupal 7 that can

00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:39,290
help you register fire all the entities

00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:41,779
and I will travel describe rest later

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,759
and services module is similar it you

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,139
can you can fetch data out of user

00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,610
taxonomy menus views so all the basic

00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:52,339
portions are covered with serving

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,230
restful or services module I ll I'll

00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:56,509
choose you make make you choose one I

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,790
like services better but restful is much

00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:01,610
more advanced if you talk to me about it

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,319
views data source if you just want to do

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,480
read-only operations you don't have much

00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:08,239
rest like you don't want to send data

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,679
update data delete data the don't need

00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,660
those kind of operations you can just

00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,999
use vuze data source to export outfield

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,009
feeds you can build feeds using using

00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:18,379
views and just export out feed using

00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:23,209
this data source and utilize them in

00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:25,489
your app doing that you may need to

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:29,329
write a little bit of custom code if you

00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:31,220
are using a lot of reference entities

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:33,160
that way you have to maybe write a

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,720
little bit of custom code to handle that

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,369
maybe or maybe not you won't even need

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,699
it so you don't have much have to worry

00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:39,699
about it

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:46,910
so web services so that service is like

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,950
expose of raw data a certain URL so you

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,990
hit a particular URL may get requests

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,740
you get it out of it could be JSON XML

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,690
whatever header is requested at four so

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,110
web service is just a so you you fetch

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:02,180
data out of it and that just works and

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,820
when we say a REST API that's like a

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,980
architecture pattern that we define to

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,830
do more operations just to read just out

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,130
of so not just get operation but you can

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,750
also do delete update and create hand so

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,670
you can create data you can update data

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,490
using that you can all respects data

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,800
that's important part of it so rest api

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,510
helps you with that so you can decide

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,190
whatever kind of architecture you need

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,560
here and you can you can go for a

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,010
read-only solution or a REST API which

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:34,220
will be much more complete and the

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:37,040
Drupal 8 you can use web services which

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,630
is in which part of core and you can use

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,040
whiskey initiative as well so Drupal 8

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,620
does it out of the box you don't have to

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,870
install any custom or contrib modules

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,130
out of out of the box it you just have

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,580
to enable couple of modules that you

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,490
have and then you can build feeds out of

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,030
the views or use the entities to build

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,950
up the feeds and that will just work

00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:03,130
which much more cleaner than Drupal 7 by

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:03,130
the way any questions so far

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:19,140
yeah you can also have specifically we

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,970
can have just a part of the page we'll

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,590
discuss it in the end I have one slide

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,840
on that yeah we will discuss a little

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:27,240
bit on that so this is all about like

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,100
complete decoupling and like redoing the

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,520
whole front end of your side and quickly

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,200
and saving the budget so so like when

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,550
you are thinking about decoupling there

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,580
a couple of things comes in mind and

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:42,780
there are a couple of ways in which the

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,520
data can flow and so like for this is

00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,010
majorly for like a read-only systems we

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,530
are we are making data flow from Drupal

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,300
to your to your apps in this diagram so

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,940
what it does is like you have a Drupal 7

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,550
side or a Drupal 8 side and you are

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,380
getting data out of it and you may put

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,500
an intermediate data base layer in

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,270
between you can use couchdb or MongoDB

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,160
so this is the architecture that could

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,260
be more useful for much larger systems

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,950
if you have a website with a couple of

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,420
thousand views a a day or a cup 10,000

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,520
of view the month you don't need this

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,810
architecture but for larger enterprise

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,340
systems you you need such kind of

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,080
architecture that can have an

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,980
intermediate layer who can handle a lot

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,170
of lot of requests so that could be a

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,450
 layer or a CouchDB layer that you

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,750
can put in couch TV is much better I say

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,300
because you get a you get a web service

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,860
part out of it already in couch TV so

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,140
you can just create directory and and

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,910
get data so and then you have the

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,870
endpoint which will be curing your

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:45,570
intermediate layer and which can give or

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:49,860
send data to your angular website or

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,870
your react website or even your app so

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,850
this is like data model for like large

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,170
organizations or whatever whenever you

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,410
think it's important for you you can

00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:01,410
have it so what you'll do you will you

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,110
will fetch you will push data from your

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,850
Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 side and you will

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,920
send it to your house to be or long will

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,040
you be databases you can use queue API

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,600
and use rush or Tron to to handle that

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,280
process for you so whenever you are

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,470
creating new items you're updating

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,950
content that can push

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:23,520
to couch TV and for mongodb and then

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:27,060
that can be solved as rest endpoints for

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,460
your angular or reactive but this is

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,330
something a lot about dot-com did they

00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,920
put a CouchDB layer in between and what

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,390
they do is like the push data into

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,370
policy we are also doing a similar

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,650
architecture in one of our enterprise

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,940
projects we are planning to use MongoDB

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,940
because that standard in our

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,220
organization and that handles the data

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,950
updates and keeps all the data and then

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,070
it pushes it into into your reactor

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,200
angular app so the benefit of using it

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,390
you don't have to bootstrap you don't

00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,240
have to paint your Drupal API all the

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:04,950
time you can just use a much faster API

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,540
built by manga or couch their file based

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:11,670
and they're much faster than response

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:13,410
time and the other data flow model that

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:17,250
you can define it like instead of

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,630
defining a new new manga or a couch TV

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,820
layer in between you can just use the

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,710
caching layer so Drupal caching is great

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,270
reviews caching Drupal caching entity

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,520
catching all of them you will be using

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,920
so caching layer can handle those

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,660
requests quickly so if they are like you

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,220
read only data you can get them much

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,860
faster if they're care if that data is

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,480
cash and you can use the Drupal caching

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,820
layer and the whole infrastructure to do

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
that that will again serve the purpose

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,600
and you don't have to spend a lot of

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,240
time redefining the middle layer and

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,190
logic to buy accuse to push data or

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,840
update data into a new database so

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:53,820
that's much faster and easier to build

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,040
data flow do I say so a little bit about

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,280
angular like how the API calls going to

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,700
be so you make a get request that is API

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,580
URL address API blogs this thing gives

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,460
me a list of all my blog items and then

00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,350
you make a get request and then when

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,690
it's successful it gets gives me all the

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,400
data and I've saved that into my scope

00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,530
that blocks that's angular variable and

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,170
which i'm going to use later in my in my

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,630
template and that's it that's pretty

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,070
much like which will retrieve my code we

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,840
don't actually do it this way we

00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,870
actually do it by our services or

00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,240
factories but to explain it by

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:32,300
I have put it in a ways so you can see

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,530
the exact get call and how you how you

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,970
how you define variable in a scope so

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,590
you we actually as I was saying you

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,960
actually do it in vas services so you

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,640
define a service at West factory and

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,340
then you return the function and then

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,570
you make a success call in there back in

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,570
your controller and define the data

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,280
fetching a single node so that's again

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:58,460
you're again defining a new factory and

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,850
you you defining a function get node and

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,380
that will that that will get you a JSON

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,179
object of your particular node whatever

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,030
you are interesting so this kind of

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:09,920
function could be used for your single

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:13,250
page single node that you are referring

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,780
to like node / 123 you make a call to

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,700
that that will make a call to this

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,530
particular URL it will send back data

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,360
and you will display that data on your

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,929
angular site so it's very very similar

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:27,290
in logic to what your hooton drew proof

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:29,360
and the data we get back from Drupal is

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,040
is that this is a data source module

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,800
that I'm using vuze data source as a

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,690
JSON output so what it's giving me all

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,360
the all the items that are requested in

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,670
JSON format so nodes and title

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,320
description image so these are like five

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,559
fields that are defined I I need to

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,780
display them in my in my list so it i'm

00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,120
just getting these data these items from

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,850
the list by title of the blog my

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,309
description my image URL and image URL

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,380
can even use your your image cache so

00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,790
that that is much more helpful here

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,790
because you don't have to reinvent the

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,160
whole wheel and getting restyled images

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,140
so so things like image cache out of the

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
box you can use with views and that will

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,130
help you building it and the rest of the

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,040
things that you will require to build a

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,020
particular item or a particular template

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,340
you can just fetch it out using vuze

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,070
modules and the previous data what we

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,110
saw in that blog output you can you can

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,660
see in angular representation what we

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,120
have here we are putting a date-date

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,600
feels like when this blog was published

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,270
and a blog source URL which is the image

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,160
and we are defining image responsive

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,380
it's a bootstrap theming at the moment

00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,230
so if using imagery responsive bootstrap

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,799
class

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:46,740
and md5 column 96 we have this we are

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:49,890
making it making the title as a link

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,220
over here so like drupal you can you can

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:56,190
define these kind of URLs in angular as

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,679
well so no stash this particular hash

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,169
you or else can can get me to any node

00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,830
node full ID i can define that in an

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:07,290
angular router so we can define those

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,410
kind of things similarly to as we define

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,809
in Drupal menu API and then we are

00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,660
showing description here and then a read

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:18,750
mode button and so this whole core will

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,120
actually print me out a list of blogs

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,559
that i will acquire for my blogs page so

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,530
this is the amount of template that you

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,900
have to put that is it this will this

00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:31,169
will gesture ng-repeat will just alter

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,760
through all my epi and it will know how

00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:34,799
all my array and it will just build me a

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,330
we will do it in demo but I was just

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,760
trying to show you how clean the code is

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,419
like how lesser amount of code you have

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,010
to you have to modify or or write to get

00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,690
it done or if you have to add in your

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,460
class you just look into it you add in

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:54,120
your class and your whole page is set

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:56,130
out routing angular has its routing

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,040
framework so you use that to define

00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:01,650
inside of angular out so I prefer like

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,260
not using a trooper routing and just try

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,299
to export that into angular it's much

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,820
faster if you define your your routes at

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,559
least in your angular app so you can you

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,360
can use the route provider to to write

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,020
throughout your apps right you are all

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,970
your routes and then they can refer to

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,340
different controllers and the partial

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:24,270
steaming partial said you're using so

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:26,850
for photo HTML faq HTML power M so these

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:32,490
are all my all my HTML partials that I'm

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:34,770
calling and pushing data so integrating

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:37,140
with clients like we already discussed

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,880
like we do it so what integration so we

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,370
can build like ionic based code of apps

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,710
for sure that's that's a gain angular

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,660
kind of sense and you can build angular

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,130
based websites so Android website is

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,750
something I really want to focus upon

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,760
because it can give you a new website

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,380
out of the box without upgrading to any

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,020
anything like drupal 8 or maybe in some

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,299
cases even Drupal 7 you can just have a

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,529
new website have a new front end don't

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,870
have to spend a lot of money you just

00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:08,640
have to write your API and then feed

00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:11,340
data to your new angular website there

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,169
is another reference so this is for

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,820
angular Drupal you can use services

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,570
module with this particular framework

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,640
it's written by a community member and

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,860
this is very nice actually it gives you

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,230
all the operations you have to do in in

00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:28,020
your angular for like node editing

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,120
fetching a node creating a node all that

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,010
is already written here so you can just

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,840
use these functions define it there and

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,309
it actually actually just look at the

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,140
examples that just implement it your own

00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:42,059
way that will be helpful it uses

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:44,159
services module and Drupal 7 all right

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:47,399
we'll do some demos and we have will

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,620
hopefully they will work I haven't

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,380
prepared any videos for offline we'll

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,309
see how it goes any questions so far

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,309
yeah

00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:27,820
yeah but like if you if you want to do

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,529
like filtering in the whole data list

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,950
which is not loaded yet you have to make

00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:34,720
a call back to the triple-n but you can

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,029
define the filters in your drupal view

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,059
and actually retrieve back data by

00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,950
sending views are filter arguments so

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:44,470
services let you do that it lets you

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,850
send back arguments to your views so if

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,889
you are making a get request to a

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,840
particular view you can send back

00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:51,610
filters or or you can search items or

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,200
whatever filter you have defined exposed

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,960
filters you are able to send them an

00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:01,059
argument here and main problem is so you

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:04,090
have properties that are nested for the

00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:06,780
rest of these services okay whose

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:11,080
services can filter on

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:16,660
project so basically nested property you

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:18,040
have to give me an example so we will do

00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,250
so this is like a basic intermediate

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,490
course at the movement where we can

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:29,440
discuss that more later in questions and

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:34,150
how do I get out of it view exit

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:41,020
presentation more so everybody pray that

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:44,470
our demos work huh really all right okay

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,110
so i have a very simple drupal 7 website

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,690
here this could be like your corporate

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,860
website your your company's new website

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,720
or one of the product that you're

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,900
working on and you're planning to move

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,480
it to your angular site and you like a

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,090
template so what i'm going to do is like

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,210
we have one template right here this is

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,640
the bootstrap template here and this is

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:08,080
called business or something it don't

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,760
stop a bootstrap if you want to download

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,050
it or if you like it so this is got

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,910
modern business so it's a very very

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:15,220
popular template it's in bootstrap

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,840
framework written so what you can do is

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,060
like you can just download the code of

00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,520
it and convert it into your own angular

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,020
project it uses bootstrap it's it's a

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,450
very very lightweight there is nothing

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,340
much it does so in the website i'm going

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,350
to show you i'm not even using ng

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,140
bootstrap framework so anti bootstrap is

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,640
a rewrite or four for angular elements

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,020
of the bootstrap framework so you can

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,180
use that heavily to build your

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,070
applications actually that's much better

00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,570
way of doing it it defines all the

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,940
directions that you will that you can

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,460
just refer and push data into angular

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,080
and a much more robust but i'm just

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,640
going to keep it very very lightweight

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,640
and just going to use a bootstrap

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,470
library CSS and JS files and angular JS

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,070
files just just out of the bath whatever

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,110
we get and build our Drupal site so this

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,170
is kind of a site that we have right now

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,210
and so so this is the angular project at

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,970
the moment I use this bootstrap template

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:10,480
which were just HTML files to build my

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,890
own angular project and it has couple of

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,390
files and couple of sections that we

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,570
have that we actually feed from our

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,789
Drupal website so i'll show you how we

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,970
are feeding them

00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:23,129
so so first of all this is a very simple

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,869
angular project it took me like less

00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:26,789
than a day to build all this but i'm

00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:28,859
going to show you i just spent like day

00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:30,749
before yesterday to come up with the

00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,429
whole thing so i was almost able to

00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:33,779
finish this whole website in this theme

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,720
so it's not it's not going to take you

00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:38,970
very long so that is the budget saving

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,879
for sure so what we have this is our

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,340
home page as our normal enterprise

00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:46,559
website has and we have one description

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,960
on top it's it's about Mumbai drupalcon

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,669
we have a description right here and we

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,799
are defining three features at the

00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:55,109
bottom about it they used to look

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,009
different but because on my projector I

00:26:55,109 --> 00:27:01,739
have very large screen so they look

00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:03,479
different they're responsive so we go

00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:05,070
into a Drupal site to check out what we

00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:07,649
have in there so in the content section

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:11,580
I have a home page I have created and

00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:14,970
I'm editing that page to feed data into

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,859
my into my particular this this page of

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,679
the website the homepage of my new web

00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:21,359
angular website so i have a mumbai

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,460
drupalcon that's i just want to rename

00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,710
my home page i say i don't think i want

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,539
it i wanted drupalcon mumbai and the

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,239
rest of it looks good and i am also

00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:32,249
defining all my features block here so

00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:34,320
these section this section is also

00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:36,090
powered by the same page i'm defining my

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,220
features block i have first one is

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,169
bootstrap 3 you ready to style and blah

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,929
blah so I they have drag-and-drop

00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:44,549
interface i can just reorder things you

00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,039
can use your drupal knowledge to build

00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:50,279
all fancy things that you want to build

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,529
and use vuze to to make make it

00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,659
appropriate as per you need for per page

00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:57,019
you can use vuze to make any output the

00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,190
way you like so we are using that and

00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:01,019
this is another feature as I'll show you

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,269
in the end so we change we made a change

00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,399
to a title of the corner of the page and

00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:07,590
it's called drupalcon mumbai now instead

00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:10,349
of mumbai drupalcon so the same way i

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:13,019
change my image change to my CMS site

00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:15,659
and now i come to my angular side and I

00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,580
the data should be updated as it is

00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,440
fetching from the same source so it's

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,299
it's it's true pecan mumbai now and

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,200
which i just updated so you are updating

00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,480
your website just as your CMS and but

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,299
you are actually feeling it to another

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,779
system which is much faster

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,580
much robust and easy to maintain I show

00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,830
you the code in a minute and the other

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,649
thing you can actually do here is you

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,720
can define your your theming outcomes so

00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:43,009
that is like a little tricky and you

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,899
have to give it a little bit of thought

00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:47,029
how you want to do it but you can define

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:49,970
templates in your in your items and you

00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,489
can actually use them to assign classes

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,619
and the way you want to customize it as

00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:56,480
we do in Drupal as well like to give

00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:58,129
control to to the person who the editing

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,749
content or who is managing the website

00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:02,659
so they don't have to get their hands

00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:06,169
dirty with a core for example for for

00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:08,389
this homepage we are using we sometimes

00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:09,889
we want to use a well class for for

00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:12,109
these three features that we are showing

00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:14,899
up here by the way we also change the

00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:17,570
order of them if you remember so for

00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:20,179
these three feature items you can if you

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,909
have you can build ability to to have

00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:24,769
different theming elements in them for

00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,629
example this is using a well feature if

00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:29,179
you are familiar with bootstrap theme

00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:32,570
well is a class that you can define it

00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:34,399
gives a nice padding layer or it so if I

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,950
say like I don't want extra padding on

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,899
my future section now and I say we can

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,539
just define that as a new field in our

00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:43,399
in our UI and you can even create a

00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:45,679
content type that can drive your whole

00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:47,659
UI and you just create a Content or you

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,419
can just create a new new settings page

00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,470
where you can define all your angular UI

00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:53,419
theming related changes that you want to

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,980
do and just push them into your

00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:57,169
configuration variables on your angular

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,940
project use them across your whole

00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:01,700
theming that's what you can have a

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,139
configurable theming as well so you know

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,659
you are not even controlling your

00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:07,989
theming from your drupal CMS you are

00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:11,929
controlling content as well as theming

00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:13,429
so as we remove the the well element

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:15,739
from it so now the well class is not

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,509
coming because I said I don't want my

00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:19,639
padding so this way you can define all

00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:21,470
the UI and theming part of your angular

00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:23,389
products so it's it's giving you more

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,429
control not just a taking control from

00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:27,470
you but it actually can give you same

00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:30,679
amount of control if not more control

00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:32,840
I'll say and so this is again a

00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,669
portfolio section so every corporate

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,169
side and the portfolio section so we

00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:37,530
have a portfolio content type that I've

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,590
built and

00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:44,400
does it it has couple of portfolio items

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,290
in it you can add a new portfolio item

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,510
and it will show up over here let's try

00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,340
to have fun actually so what I'm doing I

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,170
have whatever content I have for

00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,730
portfolio I am creating a view I am

00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,980
exporting it as adjacent field and

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:59,090
whenever a new portfolio item with that

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:03,870
is it automatically pushes it to that

00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:05,430
that particular view khalid rubicon we

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:09,090
choose an image for this new portfolio

00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:13,530
and let's use this data chart image that

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:19,310
we have and once we add it to this list

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:19,310
it will actually show up in

00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm not even sure if this is a URL this

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,130
is the URL so you see this is my views

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,530
output which i have i have an end

00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,150
pointed api portfolio Jason so i'm

00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,610
making a get request to it so the new

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:39,820
item that i just added gets added to my

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:42,250
jason feet and my my site is actually

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,860
feeling upon it so whenever i'm going to

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:51,640
make a refresh to my page it's actually

00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:53,500
going to load nothing really okay here

00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,620
we go so on the portfolio i see a new

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,030
item is showing up now so so so this is

00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,860
this is the way like you can you can

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,170
manage content in your CMS and still

00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,520
power your new UI so this is a brand new

00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,430
website that we have written which is

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,490
CMS driven in angular and with using the

00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:13,180
latest items and still having the

00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:15,790
control of a CMS so this is again faq

00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,380
section that i have built so this is

00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,840
just to demo like any other website we

00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,090
have a faq web section in over websites

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,860
so what you can use you can actually use

00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,320
field collections to power such kind of

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,820
sections you can have a content type you

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,890
define a field collection you have

00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,020
unlimited fields in it unlimited field

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,170
collections so let's try to edit this

00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:44,860
this particular page and see how its

00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:46,840
structures so if i go to my faq sorry

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,180
bug faq section so that's a content type

00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,610
right here and what i'm doing i'm

00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:56,770
creating a view again to export out all

00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:59,650
my faq questions and answers and that is

00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:03,130
building that whole page click on edit

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:05,530
and you see at the bottom we have couple

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,170
of field collections there's a question

00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:11,290
that's the answer question answer and

00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:13,510
you can sort them here it or it keeps

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,160
that in mind what sorting order it is

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,840
you can you can define different kind of

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,700
sorts whatever you like or you can even

00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,990
define a new integer elements here if

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,010
you want some say different kind of

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:25,630
sorting that can tho those are all

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,420
already part of use so you can use vuze

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,980
to two handled rest of it and so this is

00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,350
all your content that you're building

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,840
and it's in same structure as you have

00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,570
and once you make a change over here

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,330
that this page will automatically update

00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:43,210
once the website so you can you can have

00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:47,620
sort of the code behind it it's very

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:49,750
very tiny I'll show you so we are

00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,789
looking at the FAQ section and the code

00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,190
i have is like 35 lines of code that i

00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:56,370
have to write for that whole template so

00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,230
i have a container class which is a

00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:00,669
butcher plus and we have this header

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,120
section which is frequently asked

00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:07,539
questions faq and then this is my code

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,280
for for all my ethic use that's it what

00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm doing I'm all trading through my

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,800
attic use in my faq array and I'm

00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,050
displaying the title and I'm displaying

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,760
the question over here and displaying

00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,679
the answer at the bottom using bootstrap

00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,619
elements which are part of bootstrap

00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:26,169
using the same HTML divs and classes and

00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:27,760
this whole page will build out of it if

00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:29,889
I need to make a change to a class I

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,240
just make change the femur will go in

00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:37,720
and make change to this template element

00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:41,879
and I will have that update alright any

00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,879
questions around this anything

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:57,139
yeah oh yeah exactly we created a view

00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,020
and we created an endpoint hall faq

00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:06,170
dodges and it gives me all my questions

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:07,910
and answers from Drupal this application

00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,010
is fed by views you can use whatever you

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,600
like the options bed that we discussed

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,210
you can feel it by our views you can

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,800
feel it by services API you can feel it

00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:18,050
very restful api so you have a couple of

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,150
options as per your needs if you have

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,800
but like this is very fast way of

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,080
feeding the views you can you can only

00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,730
define that the items that you need I

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,380
finally just a question-and-answer field

00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:31,600
I can just define question answer

00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,600
quickly and get a free filled out of it

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,359
yeah this thing fetching data out of

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,720
drupal in a in whatever container you

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,569
need it could be very very fast and so

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,519
if you look at my faq controller this is

00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:51,390
my controller code it's making a call to

00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:54,930
faq service which is defined in my

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:57,630
services somewhere and this is making a

00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,789
get request to this particular API that

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,880
we just looked at and it's passing data

00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:07,430
back into my faq controller defining my

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:12,089
faq array and which i am feeling into my

00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:13,680
faq dot HTML actually right here so we

00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:16,200
are all trading through the whole array

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,420
over here and we are just showing the

00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,890
question and answer so whenever you are

00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,329
making changes to the view or your

00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,309
content it's going to be updated over

00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:24,960
here so the basic idea is like with the

00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:27,510
very less amount of code you can

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,490
actually put out those basic pages or a

00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,559
basic website that you have in Drupal or

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,079
an old version of Drupal into into a new

00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,450
framework like angular or react whatever

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,230
you choose will discuss about that later

00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:42,210
too but yeah that that gives you ability

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,980
so this is the pricing HTML that we have

00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,680
we have a pricing page so most of the

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,359
websites also have a product page which

00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,630
they're trying to sell so pricing tables

00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,539
can also be defined like this so this is

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:57,119
using a bootstrap to do it and you have

00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:59,220
for content items i'm exporting out as

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,720
my which are my products right now so if

00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,240
you have products you can you can do it

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,970
too and we'll discuss about products in

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,829
a second and right now i have like four

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,440
products and i have one unpublished

00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:13,619
product so if i make it publish over

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,660
here so my view takes care of my

00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,369
published and unpublished content so one

00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,140
side publish it there will be five

00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:21,089
content items instead of four so they

00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,619
will automatically appear it's

00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:25,680
responsive so it will take care of the

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:28,559
responsiveness automatically and as we

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,849
go it's bootstrap and it behaves like

00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,710
that so you are adding editing any kind

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:37,680
of content feeding it to your site is

00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:40,799
quite simple this way so you can still

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,930
use your own taxonomy items all user all

00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:46,470
content items whatever you need and just

00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:49,380
feed it to your site simple site for now

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:52,770
and so this is the blog listing page

00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:57,660
actually we we demo'd we saw in the code

00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,820
before so we have a an image title and a

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,580
description so whenever a new blog is

00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,270
added to it or whatever changes I made

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,710
to it it will show up over here and it

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,200
looks much better on larger screen

00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,849
though right now it's it squished out so

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:17,490
its image coming on top and the

00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:19,920
description is at bottom all right so

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,770
this can power all the services so you

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,150
can all even define your own services if

00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,369
you have some some different kind of

00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,660
content submission or stuff so what even

00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:29,970
do you can define your service endpoint

00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,320
you can push data to it and that will

00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,060
take care of your contacts or more

00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,950
whatever way you like it took it down if

00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,590
it's a web form web form services are

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,450
different and for for the products we

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,780
can talk about it rupal 7 there is a

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:44,490
module for commerce services that can

00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,010
take care of your if you are trying to

00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,660
build your commerce website into into

00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,420
angular that is possible using that

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:54,210
module what it does you can have a card

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,369
defined services you need to create a

00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,680
new card for anonymous or gente que dit

00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,570
user and it will you can keep adding

00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,310
items to it retrieve it back you with

00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,349
the data on the triple side a lot of

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,210
people are doing that already but yeah

00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:07,740
that's again very powerful if you have a

00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:15,390
commerce site and you want to put a new

00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:16,710
face on it using Drupal 7 alright so

00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,180
that's pretty much with the demos if you

00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:22,230
if you like to see anything but in

00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:28,310
particular I can I can show that like if

00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:28,310
any questions around it yeah

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:41,130
okay all right so mobile app is okay I

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,590
was not getting into mobile app because

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:46,080
angular is same as mobila ionic is same

00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,030
as angular I don't differentiate them so

00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,310
the same code same stuff you will right

00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:52,680
there you just have to change the

00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,510
instructive you are using directive of

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,170
an ionic framework so that's the only

00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,970
difference by the way and so if you your

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,650
organization has a need for a mobile app

00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,210
you you will build that first of all you

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,340
don't have to like that the real

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,570
question is that when you need it if you

00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:13,800
need it you how you can build it in

00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:20,610
ionic but let's see yeah yeah so so this

00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:22,470
is the website website should yes yes so

00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:24,210
the question is like when should we go

00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,370
with the app and when should we go with

00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,380
their website so so to answer that

00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:30,420
really like in general you go with the

00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,340
app with a particular set of

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,620
functionality that you want to solve you

00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,350
want to solve a particular problem oh so

00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,150
your website may be solving 10 problems

00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:41,250
you taking care of 10 things but you're

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,140
in app you'd made us one or do too and

00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,540
be very very focused what you are doing

00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,310
over there so in that case you can

00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,830
define those cases you can use those ABS

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,050
that you are already building and just

00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,820
go through it app can do much better it

00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,560
can take care of push notifications it

00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,360
can it can take care of the

00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,370
communication between users and and you

00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,310
can get them back to it back bringing

00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,750
their phone notifications and it can use

00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,180
device camera i can use device

00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,010
capabilities as ionic can code over can

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,050
so so those things when you need that

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,910
kind of interaction you can go with a

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,140
mobile app when you don't need hardware

00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,390
interaction you don't need push

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,710
notifications and you don't think that

00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,720
like you want to make lesser

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,490
functionality on app and you can just

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,260
buy into the website then in that case

00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:25,020
you can have a new angular front end and

00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,940
then angular website like that's my view

00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:33,270
of it everybody has their own views

00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:34,890
about it and so those assay is in the

00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,380
same manner you can actually feed your

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,130
your ionic app I can I can show you one

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:43,740
a plan for

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:45,029
and scar so I kneecap is is very similar

00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,930
you should find your controller you

00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:51,630
define your HTML templates and you just

00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:53,490
use ionic 2 to compile it for iOS or

00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,549
android framework that's the only

00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:58,109
difference and you use the directives

00:41:56,549 --> 00:42:01,650
the theming element that ionic provides

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:04,319
to make it almost same as as your

00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:07,200
responsive in a form of a responsive

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,940
design but it's almost similar to to the

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,269
native elements of iOS and Android that

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,269
you get you try to fight

00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:32,250
so service closed this is actually an

00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:34,560
ionic gap which is this app is actually

00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,260
fetching data from a co code based

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,110
Drupal site so this is Drupal site what

00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,760
it's doing is it's fetching all the

00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,710
sessions for a particular conference and

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,330
it has couple of dates and stuff as well

00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,420
so what we are doing we are reading that

00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:50,310
data and in ionic it gives us capability

00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,930
cap ability to use some sort of or

00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:54,240
offline database in your device as well

00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:56,520
when you need that you do that so here

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,370
we are actually relying upon a Oakland

00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,530
database we are using Lube js2 to have

00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,840
an intermediate layer we are saving data

00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,850
in Luke and we are making calls to which

00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,410
you can get a particular remark fee

00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,050
feels out of it you can sort it

00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:12,090
accordingly it's a file based database

00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:14,550
system like manga or anything you can

00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,920
also use sequent in your code of apps

00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,260
but file based system is more flexible

00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,370
you can just save your JSON object into

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,140
11 go and just make a call and so here

00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:27,270
this is the ionic app this is using

00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,000
material design in angular ng materials

00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:32,430
framework it is using and you see nice

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,940
wave animations and the things that you

00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:38,310
a cue did you see you can compile it for

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,980
Android or your iOS devices and it will

00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:44,490
work as a code over for a native app out

00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:48,270
of the box but yeah so these things are

00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:51,450
all out of open source this is the all

00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:54,210
nice animations you see all tabs these

00:43:51,450 --> 00:44:00,150
menu items everything you see that is

00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:02,190
part of ionic or ng ng angular project

00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,140
the angular material design product

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,880
sorry so so they are they are all used

00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,420
here and you can have very nice

00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,070
interactions very nice 60 frame per

00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,260
second or like almost 60 frame per

00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:16,650
second animations in your mobile device

00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:20,430
as as expected in any native app so yeah

00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:24,230
you can you can do that using this any

00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,230
other questions related to ionic yes

00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:33,329
new beginning of the session it told us

00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:36,849
as Thornton derived I will be able to

00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:40,089
face some problems to find out the

00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:43,299
cheapy mystical and I have to modify or

00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:47,980
something but i'm learning to fellate so

00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:51,190
I saw the baby's using chemical in you

00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:54,549
know so they have a nice debugging

00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,039
system he identified run the debug

00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:59,650
system so there are a lot of template

00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:02,740
committing you know if I can expect the

00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:06,369
browser I can find out easily should I

00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:10,480
45 cal how can anybody please cry my

00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:15,309
question is the movie and I heard a

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:23,950
couple of days ago and ionic beta two

00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:29,349
days I mean to better using em left to

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:34,779
right you showing us maybe tangle of

00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:37,720
mulch yeah so get the new with partially

00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:43,000
choose should I go with Alec to an IV

00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:44,829
okay I was waiting for the part where

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:52,089
you actually come to the question okay

00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:58,210
ah yes how the quality will move i have

00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:59,230
like dot APK file mm okay alright so

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,089
there are two questions the first

00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:03,789
question is you should go with ionic one

00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:05,470
or iron it too for now i'll say go with

00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:09,609
ionic one because that is only the

00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:12,339
production-ready environment that they

00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:14,470
have and it's using angular 1 dot 3 or 1

00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:16,569
dot for now and which is fine for now I

00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,609
think I don't think like a lot of people

00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:20,260
are using angular 2 dot X there is a

00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:23,559
huge learning curve between angular 1

00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:25,839
and angular 2 first of all yeah so i

00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,789
haven't jumped through that curve either

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,740
yet i'm like more towards react and

00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:31,869
angular with angular 20 tracks like you

00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,789
better be with react which is very

00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,470
similar react and i'm going to rotax is

00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:37,569
kind of where the direction they're

00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,119
heading towards let's definitely future

00:46:37,569 --> 00:46:40,609
and

00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:43,849
it but for now I will suggest personally

00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:46,640
angular 1 note x1 dot 4 or something and

00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:48,859
ionic one which is stable and where all

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,079
the support is around you you are a new

00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:52,730
new to it person like me I can still

00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,589
figure out the things but a new

00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,660
developer will face a lot of hassles in

00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:59,769
angular 2 finding those answers and

00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:02,480
ionic 2 dot X answers both of them and

00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:05,599
the other questions like where the bills

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,849
go so I nick is a PM package that you

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,759
install and then you can just write in

00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:12,380
your project ionic run Android that will

00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:15,410
run it in your Android device and when

00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,819
you ionic build android ionic built iOS

00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:21,769
that will just create you the bills

00:47:16,819 --> 00:47:24,140
build files for you yeah you get that in

00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:27,710
the build folder as any cordova project

00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:39,309
yeah yes yes so you have you used any

00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:46,700
code / project in past ok so give me

00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:48,289
Iris yeah right I can find out well in

00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,700
the bill folder you will have the pills

00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:51,589
in the bill for you you read a little

00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:55,069
bit about code or you will get to it so

00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:57,559
it uses all the same export elements as

00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:59,239
cordoba app and in the build folder in

00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,700
your I kneecap you have all the bills

00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:05,660
under iOS and Android folders you get

00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:09,259
the bill 5 APK or a whatever the iOS 5

00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:12,109
is we still have like 2 minutes left i

00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:16,460
guess and progressive decoupling one

00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:18,289
person was asking so ok we'll take

00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,999
questions like in a minute really we

00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:21,890
will go over time to the questions they

00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:23,509
will cover the slides first so

00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:25,970
progressive decoupling like that's

00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:28,190
that's amazing way I think that's great

00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,619
too progressive top decoupling like if

00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:34,519
you have a page which where you need a

00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:36,230
lot of elements which requires to update

00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:38,150
quickly or you want to build out search

00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:40,099
functionality out of a long list but

00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,079
like you want to push it as an angular

00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:43,970
block into the page then you can you

00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,220
definitely use the Drupal block

00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,349
framework to

00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,570
particular angular piece and that's what

00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:51,460
you can do progressive decoupling and I

00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,190
think that is great the heavy elements

00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:57,070
which requires a lot of API calls I I

00:48:54,190 --> 00:49:00,010
prefer they should be decoupled for

00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:02,349
example like if you have a huge new

00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,790
website and the top section loads up a

00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:06,130
different kind of news from different

00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,230
sources also based upon location also

00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,240
based upon user interest so although

00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,650
those sections could be in that

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,010
particular page could be loaded by a

00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:17,680
progressive decoupling as an angular

00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:20,500
block in Drupal and the rest of the page

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,540
can still a render as a normal page so

00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,400
in that in those kind of scenarios where

00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,560
you don't want to go completely ionic or

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,180
angular and you want to stay in your

00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,910
Drupal environment but still want to use

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,190
some fancy widgets that you can build

00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:41,890
that that in those parts progressive

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:44,410
decoupling is really important for

00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:47,410
example like thousands of other things

00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:49,990
are happening it is better for business

00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:52,270
side because you they will be loaded on

00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,920
the browser the block will be loaded the

00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,750
data will be loaded on the browser it

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,760
won't take time on the server side to

00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:00,910
render it and then send HTML so that

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,250
that that part will be will be page will

00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,619
fast much loader that particular block

00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,240
and can load later on but the HTML that

00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:09,400
we are providing wire rupal that can

00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,770
first float and show the data all along

00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:16,330
the page so the heavy heavy sections of

00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:18,040
the site can can be like this and the

00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,839
other two they wanted to refer like

00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,820
react and amber they are pretty good

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,070
react is pretty good for building

00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,950
websites to that is like more where the

00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:30,369
whole world is leaning towards because

00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:32,650
you can actually compile the HTML on the

00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:35,320
servers and and then just serve your

00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:37,810
HTML pages using reactions so that is

00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,790
something to be considered and that is

00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:41,980
very hard to do in angular 1 dot x for

00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,839
sure there is a whole hack layer that

00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,790
you have to put on it to get to that a

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,589
buttery Act gives you isomorphism

00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:49,869
isomorphic JavaScript applications out

00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:52,570
of the box and the amber is again great

00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:54,040
that is in J's framework based upon

00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,720
angular and there are couple of other

00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,049
tools in the market I just wanted to a

00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,420
real

00:50:56,049 --> 00:51:00,999
disqus angular and how you can have

00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,880
quickly in new website out of it and I

00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:07,689
use the advanced frameworks advanced

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,849
advanced tools to do it and if you like

00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:12,160
my session please evaluate on triple dot

00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:20,699
org if you don't like it no need to

00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:20,699
evaluate and thank you very much yes

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,039
no I was just referring you should not

00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,380
make HTTP GET request inside your

00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:36,660
controller I showed that controller part

00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,910
so that you can see where i'm referring

00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,589
my scope dot blogs or scope my scope

00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:43,259
variable was referred directly into the

00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:47,729
data so I said that that part should go

00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:49,799
into packages into practice that is the

00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:53,339
best practice I heard like you an you

00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:56,969
should that that is actually your so

00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:59,670
they're MVC model view and control so so

00:51:56,969 --> 00:52:01,499
it's kind of like am VVC so there is a

00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:03,029
there is a view for definitely then

00:52:01,499 --> 00:52:04,589
there is a view based controller so

00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:06,509
controllers are actually feeling data to

00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:08,940
my views so that power is actually

00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:11,249
aligned towards my making data for my

00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:14,190
view and then the hole in the back end I

00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:16,289
am defining my services to like

00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,119
generalize the rest output so those

00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:20,039
services can be used anywhere else we

00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:22,229
are ever required in the project not not

00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,329
just in that particular controller if I

00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:25,739
want to fetch that particular block and

00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:27,930
put it render it down the block on my

00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:30,719
homepage the blog section I can just

00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:32,339
refer to my service and I can just get

00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,809
the blog item then put it in a block or

00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:40,279
my horde home page after that make sense

00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:40,279
all right thank you very much and

00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:47,339
handsome Ithaca Daria and so much came

00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:50,219
on Twitter or drupal.org you can find me

00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:54,499
like that and quotients we've already

00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:54,499
