I

00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:59,519
the thing is right now the session is

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:02,879
made for all of you so its just oh d so

00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,700
I'm gonna cover maximum amount of things

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,850
like the flag is just in pain for all of

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,430
you apart from that way you can replace

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,950
like what a new will include eight it's

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,280
on windows or initiative commitment so

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,280
let's start

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:37,899
and this is what we are going to be in

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:42,270
this whole thing again first row you

00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:45,820
learn DVD and 30 leading technicians

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:51,250
next is diverse views which are

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:54,280
integrated with Google and next Levela t

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:58,590
is how we can have be reading with

00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:02,080
people of apart from that will probably

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:06,640
see how we hike is integrated with

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:12,310
Triple H and then we actually see that

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:14,769
book sleeping as will you cook eat and

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:19,000
some actually three this site and most

00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:24,239
of us every label and a want to explain

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,239
this to me please subscribe

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:36,680
yes sweetheart we will eventuate site

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,010
available free vector Q wave or

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,320
suffering actually leg 2 is a disruptive

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,260
activities I just when you actually find

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,390
it wherever possible attacks along with

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:53,600
indie actually what we tested it shows

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,140
is that it validates and verifies won't

00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:03,880
leave customers or would actually the

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:07,520
production how new is this goal by TDD

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,700
approach moving on how many of you know

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,970
what is P D D of V DD raise your hand

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,900
I'm gonna take package which I would

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,900
like to explain it

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,440
yeah yeah

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:40,590
absolute effect so this is an exhibition

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,390
of tdd is liability know the aim of

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,390
killing is basically for development

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:50,350
cycle in which first we write the test

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,660
and then we the test initiated in fact

00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,120
it is one fail because we don't have

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:59,440
report in yet corgi from shali doing

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,350
here so next we will require local

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,680
charlie is written so heather is ask and

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:10,330
then we just keep on refactoring or

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,340
feeling the court will require product

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,040
or the required functionality has been

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,890
completed this is the main thing work

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:24,070
people of next is really the regulation

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,430
of be really family but it is operator

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:30,169
working cycle in which we will see

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:37,520
basically augment it

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:39,409
of the how the stakeholders actually

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,979
what their brother filling the behavior

00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:46,819
of the product this must be we really

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:49,960
developed for non-technical people so

00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:53,360
that they can actually work across

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:57,169
making sure that what the stakeholders

00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,819
or customer wanted is given out how it

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:03,499
is equally cos curve shaker proposal

00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,330
business applications require with our

00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:08,689
Georgian Armed and they are absolutely

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,419
fit in as an input for the VVD earth

00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,999
Spartacus and the stakeholders can

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,279
actually evaluate while running these

00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:21,529
tests or through this approach that what

00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:23,930
they required was given out or not so if

00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:27,349
you say that like something that happens

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,620
in real life applications like the first

00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:33,560
thing before the development is they

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,439
require active element is actually given

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,389
to the esters okay this is what is what

00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,360
we expected out of three functionality

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:43,430
so uniquely right it is come back so

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,189
they know that this was done but the

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,889
only difference with DVD and legally is

00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:52,129
a completely rewrite s before like in

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:58,430
DVD we write the behaviors after the

00:05:52,129 --> 00:06:01,449
code has been done anyone wants to

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,449
elaborate on that please

00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:11,340
okay so that was the practical

00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:13,080
implementation like we was after good

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,839
behavior and then revise the

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,240
implementations for that features and

00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,219
then validate rhythms African together

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,210
it's required or really to make some

00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:27,300
changes further or me this way okay you

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:32,430
have this full application or the world

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,930
of Shalott okay next is like the tools

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:41,430
but we are going to tailgate right now

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:45,270
compatible matt is in fact caption we

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:48,089
have phpunit as well label these poor

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:53,580
automation tools we can use to actually

00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:58,379
work around it with it and all of them

00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:02,449
working to the same husband so let's

00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:04,979
just be really context this is what I

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:09,270
speedily most i am going to probably a

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:14,039
test with extending how we had actually

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:18,229
was before that how many people know

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,229
have or ever gonna be hard

00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:37,090
it'll be something Wow extra gonna

00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:40,660
happen in this fashion so the definition

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:47,020
of we had we had a believer driven

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:50,410
development in PHP framework and we have

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:56,320
actually written with a special language

00:07:50,410 --> 00:08:00,099
called working look it is basically your

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,020
normal english language it's not like

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,419
you guys in JavaScript or something

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,080
different so that's why it becomes in

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:10,900
handy for the chewing what we won't have

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,349
much knowledge of who because if th here

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,560
in either framework which with the

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:20,139
application is made on plus it is more

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,000
readable for these stakeholders so we

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,849
can read through it is hardly the time

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,460
oh I want this I want this okay this is

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:36,370
our bass that's how it is used equal to

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:39,669
equal to that room so how we had

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,339
actually works and probably get back on

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,560
your feet because a lowly and I'll

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,980
explain you how do it is written

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:52,540
obsolete and all the elements of that it

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,180
is going on but if I love how we had was

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,490
we have four elements physically in

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,130
which we are going to look first is the

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:09,860
feature files second

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:13,670
and then we have eyes ideabooks first it

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,050
half its have two broken because that is

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,110
what is going to be written in your

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,730
future fights so go get is basically

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:29,990
your language that would work as another

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:33,320
cycle uses and has been there why the

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:37,300
inverse muse is basically it was develop

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,770
so that the bond technical users are

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,960
beautifully and actually understand

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,930
what's being done because this is a very

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,330
English language so they can actually

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:57,110
relate to it and understand what's

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:59,500
required feature files and four features

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,500
wires is really what is length is what

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:06,380
you want to do or what the feature is

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,820
actually being made for is written in

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:13,040
this and to the future has basically

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,520
have the thought feature extension and

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,530
we write all the scenarios from this

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,750
scenarios are written over here and it

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,450
basically the numbers what the

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:30,260
application is going to do or what

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:34,220
behaviors will move so we actually hot

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,130
in feature got wire earth Gujarat else's

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,260
work feature files if we have first

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,830
complete cards feature that is a keyword

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,540
used to identify with feature and in

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,519
future

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,350
actually right now we need few lines

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,380
which are normal english language which

00:10:47,350 --> 00:11:00,069
actually explains what this is going to

00:10:50,380 --> 00:11:01,389
do and then we have few lines despite of

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:05,370
the science I think we have the

00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,370
scenarios which outlined in this one

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:26,880
explaining what this is we probably from

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,209
eat it first of all a user needs to have

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,240
an account in the bank and he needs to

00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:36,000
have a valid ATM card so you have to be

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,920
like this now so that the stakeholders

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,529
or the person who is really understands

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,850
what this whole HR file is gonna do or

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,329
what the functionalities it's gonna

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,829
power it is a brief description and it's

00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:49,860
like this and then you have their

00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:51,690
scenarios you cannot well suppose an

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,630
idea of your feature files depending

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,630
upon what becomes ID on the power india

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:09,250
scenarios for scenarios with a you have

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,930
the individual behaviors or small Park

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,900
insanity which you want to come into

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,590
this you actually apply now for example

00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:22,420
in this I wanna see that how we reverse

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:24,100
the money so happy to this type N equals

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,220
should be draw some money from his agent

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:31,480
part the world needs to be done first of

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:35,260
all he needs to have a valid credit card

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:39,220
or debit / net is about lasted half of

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:42,130
money and he searched his card in the

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,190
ATM machine and then we withdraw money

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,980
now the wait now what does the alien

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,890
middle infineon machine should it should

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,690
be give you the money and lastly in the

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,480
account balance should be available you

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,550
should see that power valances

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,600
so this is a small example or less a

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:08,410
person either if anyone questions please

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:10,510
feel free ones okay next becomes like

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,959
scenario of things there are times when

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,480
we want you I have the same scenario

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,250
repeat for three or four users or

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,290
something like we want mathematical

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,110
solara convertible Thanks this

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,940
implementation of scenarios so we are

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,760
not on the right this marry again and

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,730
again there's one thing was finale of

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,820
times what it does is exponent run the

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:38,740
scenario each time you have an entry for

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:42,670
a house it up sob instead of using

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,040
scenario we use scenario friends it's I

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,470
hope as you actually write down your

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,770
scenario but instead of putting the

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,630
values you actually write up physics or

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:57,730
priests holders and later on in your

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,709
below you write examples where you

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,339
actually put it the values of your focus

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:05,680
of preschoolers so what he does is V

00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,839
naught will actually like this scenario

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,480
multiple times it will go through each

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,589
rope replace those focus with those

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,740
values and running so you have small

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:20,950
code which my transfer take ice or 12

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:25,300
kinds but you have written only once so

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:28,240
it is really useful board or features or

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,150
we did say behaviors which need some

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,820
functionality and it needs to be a

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,870
multiple among the fans like what even

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,790
ignore takes

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:41,610
like I add this much Vanessa practice

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,410
much it'd be odd multiples or

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,779
multiplication several listening just

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,510
like how to calculate the transactions

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,730
being that like if your functionality

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:56,500
using something like this if this was

00:14:51,730 --> 00:15:00,310
our eating disorder probably something

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,830
like this or Robbie what I have used it

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:07,990
is to actually with you go sweetie with

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:11,200
respect my headlights or my mu palmares

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:14,200
actually have the values or predefined

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:21,779
values across my usage basically where I

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:25,300
usually the next thing is background

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:28,029
click back dog is missing sometimes you

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,310
need that a precondition or you want

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:33,320
some predefined history of already

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,150
existing the horizon re

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,610
Hedman are you will actually feel

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,610
because I'm pernicious was missing and

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:46,430
it's very hard for you to find as a QA

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:49,900
or take advice of my work as we head so

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:52,610
for us to be showed up some that

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,590
something takes for all the tea for

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:59,540
features is already be able to use

00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:03,290
backgrounds so your background is you're

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:06,470
entitled smile it contains a number of

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,380
steps with it fits what we have the

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:13,040
background is always run before your

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:20,930
scenario right after one book which is

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:24,590
your before tsunami so for example used

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:27,290
is like a black edit who wants to be

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:30,620
drawn anything is it in machine should

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:33,710
actually have account of the guy and you

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,980
should give a lecture for dinner I need

00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,260
to have a successful we draw so this was

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,310
it again this will ensure that it runs

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,780
first ended this management it is

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,550
something is missing in your background

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,450
the boat is you can google veeram

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,520
because all because as I said that your

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,520
background was before the features work

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,400
or before the scenarios so you know that

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,270
okay this is not looking edition is not

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,270
available for us

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:16,430
the next is how we can write with it

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:20,150
steps oh ok all this is when we were

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:22,880
seeing that we had given legs and butt

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:27,170
and these are basically your steps Oh

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:31,100
your scenario I or use my abilities

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,650
multiple steps which actually describes

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:39,220
yoga middle of each actually that is

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:42,890
being performed so four steps we have

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:52,000
keywords already defined which I given

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:56,870
then read and actually we park actually

00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,870
written by V you feel it went length and

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:04,880
bus was given basically of we have a

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,040
forgiving it is like you need to know

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,210
where your system is right now or a

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:13,760
quick position or you could say which

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,340
state my application is right now so

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,560
forgive it like I want to be on this URL

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,800
right now so i'll probably i attack

00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,900
given up on this reward is pushed with

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:30,320
us cause we're deciding point for my

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:34,070
slang and then read it basically you

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,490
describe what user action is going to be

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:41,110
done if i click on this when i click on

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:44,600
this when i visit this mean i do this

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:47,360
let us then politics I get out of this

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,150
vertical outcome of the action that was

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,360
before are you and then we have to act

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:56,330
and verse which articles for length or

00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,650
you can say what goes up in an action

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:03,800
before his very poor and it is like you

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:07,430
have something like idealistic I saw

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,970
this and I suppose I should expect an

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:14,900
annex pakistan's it will but you it is

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:18,880
basically a negation that but we should

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,880
not be working for this is for expected

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:31,640
next is actually this covering your

00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:34,370
defines X a video having react principal

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,400
is there a lot of things that google it

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,590
extension gives you already so you don't

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,810
have to write your steps again you

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,380
already have it with how you can use

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:49,310
them for that we actually have a pointy

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:54,140
hat look I will dl it actually uses the

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:55,700
listing of all the three different steps

00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,830
that have already available and you be

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,830
using school crimes

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,680
and if you want to have more information

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:12,940
about double as we use hyphen D out

00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:15,850
where it is useful is like I and a dell

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:19,360
angle developer work I and what actually

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,310
work as we had and I feel like I what it

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,370
is I don't know anything how will I

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,560
write my skills so i can actually go

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:29,380
ahead just write this come on and i can

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,840
see the whole district of high already

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,910
predefined things i can actually gives

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,600
you a little type of if you are right

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:41,290
something similar or something different

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,820
from what is already given and you don't

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,970
want to change it you can actually take

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,580
a copy of it and actually modify it on

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:52,390
to your own needs then it is actually

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:55,480
helping plus it is helpful for at the

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,730
few way people because we can actually

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,160
write the test case for music everyone

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,080
at blink extension which already gives

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,970
you some constant is like clicking on

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,490
links and already defined there you just

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,650
need to replace the bogles and we need

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,320
to write like and this what police we

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,250
take for this so we can actually like it

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,250
over there

00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:25,180
okay whenever we actually have this test

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:28,510
we expect some results only thing I best

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,880
fail fast how's it done we have actually

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,690
10 states in being happy I previous

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:39,900
which leaves you whether your step was

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,900
passed or not yes if chillin these are

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:47,290
undecided if I write as a definition

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:51,370
which does not have much existed in

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:53,280
high-pitch I Reger specify which does

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,290
not happen takes already available there

00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,300
it does not know what with these two

00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:02,860
valence let it will give me give me a

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,040
exception sake it is undefined you need

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:09,970
to actually write this down so this is

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,070
welcome David people are just written in

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,930
feature fires and eggs I got this leads

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,790
to be loved but it's not already

00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:19,350
available so you can actually work and

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,350
you can write it on video fixed

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:35,529
next is pending something a pending is

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:37,929
basically a something like a definition

00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:40,090
which you are actually written like when

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:42,460
you are ready or not is fine you

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,889
actually operate it down and you hold it

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,869
but you have not given an action what

00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:48,970
needs to be performed let the exception

00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:50,789
of ending is returned but something

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,309
needs to be returned by this I by this

00:22:50,789 --> 00:23:00,639
definition and is expected out of it so

00:22:54,309 --> 00:23:03,789
the exception there is ending then we

00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:05,830
have killed this even you have your

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,749
undefined definitions or pending

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,929
definitions what happens to those take

00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:13,179
that I've written below it whether they

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,999
will be life or not whether they will be

00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,340
giving a pass or fail nothing like this

00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:21,539
happens they are actually skip see the

00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:23,799
current cannot see them to balance the

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:27,249
difference and you can identify that

00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:33,149
this book it on one just you already get

00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:33,149
a result vesting business customers get

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:43,059
it actually gives you the best thing

00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:46,119
call me hack is where it will tell you

00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:49,029
add extension in any case it was feel it

00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:52,539
was passed or something look above step

00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:56,769
was the stake of the above set is given

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:59,859
so you go like that's why it otherwise

00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:03,239
we'll move we will not know what happen

00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:03,239
soon it's not like you

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,509
so is he

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,510
I

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:37,550
again we proceed further but it depends

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,740
got it high dependency like if your link

00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,540
goes a little on backpage because

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:46,150
already react or you do not find the

00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,150
link in your example

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:15,710
not funny my earthly would be shape my

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:20,129
definite

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:23,700
no actually it is on the same page it

00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:26,909
will actually move I get it it is

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:30,629
basically you have some pending a it's

00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:32,610
something else if the resolution was not

00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:34,350
available or if you had something I

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:39,450
defined I could close depending on that

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:41,610
like I said if one is your button for

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:45,600
you can say oh anyway put on the other

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:48,720
page and you are written a step before

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,940
that pic on this page and then you click

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,549
on the other big fishes work them from

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,019
the next page let me back is it will

00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:59,039
actually get skin because if you have

00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:02,970
kind element so in the hands of our

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:09,059
clinic or what is it was before the next

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:11,309
execution will depend upon that many

00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,649
have failed in case something was

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,389
something went wrong if levites active

00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:17,820
element or if you expecting something

00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:27,210
out of it and it was not a blizzard and

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:30,870
we have a fee takes it and reduce in

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:33,000
ambiguous basically I ll tell you in

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,950
because they learn more because they are

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,940
correlated or they really think and you

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:41,100
get spit letter that is readily in Vegas

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,399
it is like you have a set definition

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:47,549
which actually has a good taste like

00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:51,389
give it I am given I should see this and

00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:53,490
you actually pass it over gates and you

00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:56,220
have something another reputation which

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,019
is similar to this so when we had

00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,980
actually writing it gets confused

00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:05,279
between which which is the actual

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,250
implementation add an army goose that in

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,350
that case

00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,270
you liked this is ambiguous because

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,810
labor rules and regulations which

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:16,990
actually fulfill this tape criteria or

00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:19,690
your step you define then there's

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,580
 just retirement basically be

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,250
height doesn't let you hide the stapes

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,920
tech definition again if you are often

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:29,860
Schmidt again that it will give you

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,780
become because it moving one small step

00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,600
recreation it doesn't want multiple step

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,640
definitions if you like multiple

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,380
definitions it will get it views that

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,430
what was their intention of writing to

00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:47,170
which means to be the kind of fun so you

00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:49,990
have this vast is successful if everyone

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:55,570
correctly will give you real thing and

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:59,890
you'll be happy fun Unitas worse okay so

00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:02,830
next is TAS fact is basically a way of

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,740
categorizing your king of how you can

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:11,970
actually work across using our use and

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:16,080
have my little things I mean I will have

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:19,360
these three shires working for what

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,650
vtable circles so how can we categorize

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,860
we use tags in this case where we can

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:29,980
actually apply the guards is above

00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:36,040
feature files scenarios your scenario

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:39,040
times and your examples even the places

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,380
you can actually quite as before in case

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,080
you write somewhere else like if you

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,210
write in background it will give you an

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,130
exception it will throw it at it's not

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,000
working so these are the beautiful

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:54,380
places where you can

00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:02,180
right hands so it is a way of

00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:06,740
categorizing video things in terms next

00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:09,080
is yahoo's before not i'll just tell you

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:12,920
what cooks plus it's going to do

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,200
builders because what it does is when

00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,950
you're writing your application or your

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,870
writing of s their places where you

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,630
would want to have certain conditions or

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:26,090
preconditions that needs to be done or

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,360
you want to actually change the logic

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:33,830
behind it before that so it gives you an

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,330
entry point at various places where you

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,400
can actually change this accreditation

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,620
so you can have your precondition so you

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,980
can actually write that crew I want this

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:49,810
I wanna so these are basically no 83

00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:52,790
points oh we had VI actually from the

00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:56,120
book's cover will be fine and you can

00:29:52,790 --> 00:30:00,140
actually use them as well as you can

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:05,480
actually associate your tags along your

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:07,970
boots so you go back alcovy comedy clips

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:13,820
and slide before we actually cover the

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:19,750
hoops okay so you got any coins for

00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:25,160
boots are add sir before your suit sweet

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:27,029
then you after sweet and before every

00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,759
turn

00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:38,409
okay feature we've already smell you and

00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:42,539
after scenario before a mistake or after

00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:45,880
state so if we are twisting across then

00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:49,600
you before sweet is basically before

00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,149
Eddie be high test is run before any

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,710
future final slowly if you want to make

00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:58,980
some changes you can you severely our

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:02,350
Freya suite has a lead us to something

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:07,240
you use this you can actually set this

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:09,070
where with for food would be a best

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,049
accountant would be I wanna get this

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,269
type this is how production side I

00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:16,090
oversleep my database of the hell i

00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:19,419
would rather have a village somewhere

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:22,149
taste I want to be back what is that you

00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:25,690
could be this after would be like if you

00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:28,450
are done some concrete its up against

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,580
and all but you don't want to keep them

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,929
again there you can actually write in

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:37,570
your after suit like okay just but it

00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:42,419
just bite of that later this and get

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:48,549
back man installation back again I would

00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:51,610
really smack copy of that next is your

00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:54,100
before featured files okay if I want to

00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:57,669
have get something done before my speech

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,799
1325 I can actually have it there and

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:02,500
before having this feature just do these

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,320
things and there is parking I features

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,169
and do this thing if I want to take a

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,779
state for my future file before which is

00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:11,669
different than what is right

00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:13,830
present in my application I can do it

00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:15,629
over here in after I can just replace it

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:19,769
and put my application back into the

00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:23,219
same feature a state similarly as you

00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:25,499
say as this is before scenario and half

00:32:23,219 --> 00:32:29,940
the scenario is right it is actually one

00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:32,669
for each signal in five so if I want to

00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,450
actually do something before westin are

00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:40,019
you like if I want my own JavaScript or

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,599
my browser to be at certain needed see

00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:48,109
configuration like certain screen size I

00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:52,589
will do that next is like the course in

00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:59,580
before every gift give it then what it's

00:32:52,589 --> 00:33:02,489
gonna work or head ok this is an example

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,649
of poof I have actually taken an example

00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:08,820
of the four scenario where I'm setting

00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:10,950
my screen size of my browser and I want

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:16,229
my witness nice to be of this whenever

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:20,219
my firefox or my browser is loaded for

00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:24,749
doing that i need to actually have write

00:33:20,219 --> 00:33:27,479
this use my name space of before we

00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:29,460
force it i bespoke and for after ages

00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:32,429
after sunanda scope if i am actually

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,469
using these classes these functions it

00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:37,859
will not work I below this anger of

00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:40,879
people i have rid of these green spaces

00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:44,989
it's not going to be working title

00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:44,989
that's one thing that is required

00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:57,590
next is a booth like I will say that it

00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,990
is i have written before scenario but I

00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:04,760
don't want it to run for each and every

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:07,520
scenario like I have my we had suit is

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,580
like carbohydrate scenarios I don't want

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,100
my two dynamic each egg but I want to

00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:17,090
love it for specific scenarios and i'll

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:20,169
probably add in the cab so what it does

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,820
is when you actually write in your

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:26,630
feature file will probably write this

00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:30,169
feedback for example I can I have this

00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:33,050
before scenario as attached to it in my

00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:35,390
future file the form I scenario of crime

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,419
or become a scenario i'll try to stay in

00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:42,380
that so what it does is that it will

00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:45,320
identify that this we force and I or the

00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:49,250
stag needs to be run for this and it's

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:54,440
going to that next you can actually see

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:57,380
over here is that I have I'm also so

00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,230
what do is that it's gonna look for the

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:06,400
ad very database and it also going to

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:06,400
look for either a picture if I work

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:12,720
then only my this function needs to be

00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:15,090
done if something is very wrong with you

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,240
and it's not gonna get us so you can

00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:21,360
actually use and I all in along with

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,770
that if you want to have a good soup

00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:30,650
there we go use Hyper cool you want to

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,650
run your befores and afters many times

00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:01,250
basically you write for categorization

00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:04,609
like if you have something like this

00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:06,680
needs to be authenticated user I might

00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:09,740
add it is it to be anything I can

00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,049
identify as they recover litigated so I

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,480
want another style that needs to be run

00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:16,700
before authenticated users only it

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,950
doesn't need to be asked for this or it

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,500
has a dependency like this position

00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,150
needs to be signed before by as the

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,250
other scenario works so i will probably

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,970
have it along with anger it

00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:32,030
authenticated so both of our on each x

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:34,790
it identifies for this the other a go

00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:37,599
switch to the rock so we have actually

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:40,490
runs through types of movies arrives

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,430
first it will go for future fights in

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:46,010
each a files if it is a hack it will

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,680
look if you're in is there another ad

00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:52,730
for this as well if there is it will

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,880
that scenario again it might be handled

00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,130
in different features brought pizza pie

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,630
so it think that these i categorize

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,839
together indeed sleeps two belong

00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,839
together

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,760
thousands yeah there was an extension we

00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:39,410
talked to get up we had actually live

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,690
video screen shorts you need to

00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:44,540
configure it and there is an extension

00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:56,660
which will actually shorts and powerful

00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:58,369
I have seen because we had actually

00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,320
supports like it depends on the

00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:03,339
extension if actually supporting those

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,339
probably will go

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,520
all expenses

00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:33,490
that depends completely on your

00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:35,500
functionality like what we want to do we

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,080
heart is not something that will get

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,700
your units it is basically for your

00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,800
acceptance testing and some

00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,070
functionality to that extent we can use

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,740
it now it depends suppose if we have to

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,210
develop for you behavior if you believe

00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,400
in the more you can use it to that

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:57,060
extent it depends completely on what is

00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,060
required out of your functional

00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:06,040
vintage the phone will be hard yeah like

00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:06,040
giving your this water I

00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:25,310
okay next is the text we actually work

00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:28,250
right now with features and we realize

00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:31,310
God for my step definitions if I write

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:33,500
something but the custom I need to have

00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:37,510
something in packets which will actually

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:40,579
test it what feature does it actually

00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:43,760
this Christ all your application is what

00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:46,599
I believe but what context is lust is it

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:53,380
is actually gonna test your application

00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:53,380
so it was it is this an extra

00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:04,540
this is hoping XV wherever you are

00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:09,460
please call your boodles you actually a

00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:11,890
very good stalker we had a file is

00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:16,480
already created that is the feature can

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:18,550
taste so in fact I we have this class I

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,109
will be available in this cus i will

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:26,980
write my action that okay this needs to

00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:29,140
be loved how it is it's rooted like this

00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,710
when i do something something should be

00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,710
expected

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:42,500
okay so what about if I want to use my

00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:47,869
the booth and text it gets like I want

00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:50,920
to use my cg conviction and I want to

00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:53,930
use liquid ex-husband and I were

00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,020
insulated context if every is learning

00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,089
as well i will use trusted x I will do

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,420
all all this thing that is given

00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:04,760
alkylene is it possible it is possible

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,400
how's it possible if you re hi got

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,190
violence when you actually defined it

00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,369
connects you can do this thing like who

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:15,109
feature he takes is you bleep context in

00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:17,450
which whatever you were right it's going

00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:20,119
to be there but if you want to use some

00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:24,650
other expenses then it will help in your

00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:28,579
we have a plan or fell for example this

00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:31,700
is lovely if your application is very

00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:33,829
big and you're actually wanna write lot

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,349
of lehigh test what is recovering your

00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:40,369
future architects pile is going to be

00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:42,740
very thick very very i think is it's

00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:44,990
probably a mother earth knowledgeable at

00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,640
some point of time and you might not

00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,380
even know that some equations for

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,259
defined

00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:52,930
something conditions really kind again

00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:55,630
so in that is what we can do is we can

00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:59,470
actually divide it and we can have like

00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:01,809
little and X Files but how will your

00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:04,420
tests know that okay this context file

00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:07,059
is available in this and this is not so

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,250
for that envy you have got violent you

00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:11,859
actually write your other files or you

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:15,549
can txt files from where it will find

00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:19,569
this tech definitions so when ya copy it

00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:23,259
down some butyl if I want to use intro

00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:25,630
functionalities we might be hard and for

00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:29,890
that i am only need to write that if I

00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:32,200
we had to find this is what connects you

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,970
to the next to speak you that so i will

00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,789
probably have all the functionalities

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:40,779
like you to agree with me presently so i

00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:42,309
can modify that i can use my old tech

00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:49,359
technicians room and the cool things

00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:52,420
called triple right i said or driven a

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,269
text we actually have two things what is

00:42:52,420 --> 00:43:03,369
no true blue context and the other is to

00:42:55,269 --> 00:43:06,369
look at text oh when you actually in

00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:11,529
your we have got wild offense in your

00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:15,309
feature context you have if you see it

00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:17,829
actually in three mins or your rock

00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:20,170
google context fatherland hilton things

00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:25,450
because it will actually give you all

00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:28,329
the elements at available in them and

00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:32,170
your drupal context activates and score

00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:34,329
to the place that's how it is huh so

00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,100
depending like what function it is you

00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:38,740
do you will extend

00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,750
if you want some political strategies

00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,850
you can actually use through the text

00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:46,120
but if you want the growth things like

00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:48,790
about the book a titties and I want to

00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,330
have this before it is actually rendered

00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:54,100
so my google even then you should use

00:43:51,330 --> 00:44:04,090
water to the text it lets go peepee

00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:06,430
become shy but like i said what google

00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:12,780
them takes like I want to order my your

00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:15,910
object then I need to extend my this I

00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:20,530
probably a hydrocodone text and I need

00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:22,690
to use my being spaced enrich my lord

00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:25,360
object is given out that but i'll

00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:28,090
probably valley triple extension hooks

00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:36,970
in which i can order this this is how it

00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:39,310
is done okay there's was something like

00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:42,190
Google but apart from google if I want

00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:48,130
to do something we can actually use we

00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:52,540
already me along with this what week is

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:58,390
in it actually gives you more optional

00:44:52,540 --> 00:45:01,420
if it is already will like if I already

00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:04,570
right like click on elements if I want

00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:07,150
to fill some things like so i will be

00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,890
used drink along with my google a rather

00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:13,270
than actually riding I will

00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:15,540
definitions for that a forming you

00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:24,430
actually it's in your blinking text and

00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:27,580
let's call it is on okay next is your

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:31,780
phantom chase what does I Ganges

00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:35,230
basically does if you are actually using

00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:38,710
V hat directly you will not be able to

00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:42,970
do certain functionalities because what

00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:46,330
it is using is type of address browsers

00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,980
so you have are able to have the ability

00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,080
to actually have the JavaScript

00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,600
commonalities or ejects functionalities

00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,090
you not alter that or you can have this

00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,270
after i press this this should pop up

00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:01,240
that's not gonna happen in case you want

00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:05,050
to check your for javascript things or

00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:08,020
if you want happy after elements of a

00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:11,110
god you're a Jaques if you want that you

00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:14,860
will probably happening extend Adam

00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:17,740
chase along with yogi hat fell what it

00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:22,660
will do a conscience is basically a

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:26,410
headless browser emulation and it will

00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:31,120
actually help you have JavaScript

00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:35,380
elevations along with it in behalf and

00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:37,860
mj's actual article boost what does it

00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:41,100
will act like it's using selenium as a

00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:46,930
back-end but instead it's using a

00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:52,090
pattern sheets that was it for my

00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:55,630
fashion and I had a demo but it

00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,059
certainly was not working so but i can

00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,900
actually

00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:58,900
and files

00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:35,520
this is my do you have a client right if

00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:39,530
that's a toilet a cleft I wanted to use

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:43,140
my beautiful cake so I had to look at

00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:45,470
first I will reduce me so I am handing

00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:48,570
over him I can actually have some

00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:52,530
formalities also like I believe in size

00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:56,700
or i feel myself i have this thing right

00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:58,800
just to see all brush like scoring all

00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:02,520
the thing that is actually get in a rush

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,930
in taste so this is how it is done in

00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:09,690
this if the leaf when you are actually

00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:11,550
writing this yup type of base URL the

00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:14,130
URL on which you are actually going to

00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:17,930
do your testing or you are going to run

00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,930
your application please be your

00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:25,350
scenarios and features on this this can

00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:28,860
be something of your local this can be

00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:31,440
something on the lights and ask them we

00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:36,570
need to have you aren't according to

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:39,630
that one thing is that what I observed

00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:42,000
words if you actually said oh you are

00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,370
like who will not call or you can have

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,280
your production site or to cool and then

00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:49,620
you are trying to run off in book at X

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,970
it's not gonna work because you look at

00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:57,120
X needs of physical environment where it

00:49:53,970 --> 00:50:01,050
is nothing in fact is you can actually

00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:03,630
use something which is gonna be very has

00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:07,040
Jillian has to be like this diocese gets

00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:11,400
according to that and absolute s takes

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:16,350
practice please so then I scored might

00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:18,750
be high I got this bill file Maggie

00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,790
height is actually valid and it did

00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:22,410
actually use all the scenarios and it

00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,230
will actually run the features from this

00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:29,760
time we don't usually mess around with

00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:32,790
it but the next thing is like your

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,640
future this is actually good for each

00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:40,500
night for each title this guy is going

00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:42,840
to be cold so I like we were saying that

00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:46,290
we probably have all right poor

00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,660
available over there like i can write my

00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:52,560
before scenarios and all this thing over

00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:55,140
here so what so when when the scenario

00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,060
is running if you look for that act and

00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,060
it will identify whether if it's free

00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:04,860
run right now or not because this kyle

00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:08,490
is we called each time so as I think

00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:11,220
that right now it's you're wrong due to

00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:13,200
the text instead of du biggen text

00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:17,060
because it wants to you to have your

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,060
entities and you can actually use them

00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:25,320
if this is a small example of your

00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:27,210
feature file it is volatile birthing

00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:31,890
right now because of money issues will

00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:33,900
mind if I hope so it comes with you I

00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:37,900
can actually help you I can explain you

00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:41,080
this right now like given I am

00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:43,640
when i watch movies i should see my

00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:48,010
element i deceived this should be

00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,010
already available my shattered my psyche

00:51:50,290 --> 00:52:01,040
and what if what else is that when

00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:04,250
you're trying to install your we had you

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,220
are sweetie i have got my composure and

00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:09,710
that's the best thing what i felt was so

00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:12,350
you actually need to write a proposal or

00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:15,740
Jason in this you actually write your

00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:17,600
google extension for you be high or you

00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,420
can actually write out your behalf and

00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:23,300
be hot version and when you actually do

00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,860
a composer installed this is Barbara and

00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,870
you'll probably have your dependencies

00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:29,810
already there if you want to have

00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:35,090
something like a specific version of

00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:37,610
your things like for my guzzle like lure

00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:41,720
people use it and if you wanna have

00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:44,330
something work assess living it is a

00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,210
were looking at Google extension you can

00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:49,310
actually write down my head and I

00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,710
actually specified it with your own

00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:54,530
figuration in this i specified there

00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:57,620
might be hot file is which is one of us

00:52:54,530 --> 00:53:00,230
left so I was specified from did it

00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:05,800
leads to fight my dream act I'll this

00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:08,800
one you got no be not so that most

00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
negative

00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:20,950
for execution I just think we all this

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,440
this Derek that is Neha and then I need

00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:26,770
to have Vince clash we had in typical a

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,230
three-run mangoes sooo crazy water on

00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,940
something like specific site like we'll

00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,760
all feel like I wanna leave this for

00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:37,380
Charlie to Vida sticky so i can actually

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,780
write little / you had hyphen hyphen and

00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,250
attacks and this my time at the river so

00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:46,240
it will actually run loose collective

00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:48,280
backs oh yeah and you don't even have

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,810
your kids as a big feature files yeah

00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,810
you have this case again feature

00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:27,950
it has a definition like you take length

00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:27,950
cosmetic actually defining your behalf

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:47,430
we have you just impossible and

00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:53,520
you need to but it's already documented

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:56,880
well on the site beehive inside we have

00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,190
a god you only need to create thought of

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,640
both or Jason fights and then you need

00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:06,210
to have your compositions for ignite die

00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:11,310
and then you just have a composer is

00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:19,920
called and asked and you happy happy I'm

00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:23,220
doing at your peril xq of they achieve a

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,720
parallel activation of his cases how do

00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,150
you at your peril education of test

00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,490
cases will be had for let's say I have a

00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,380
hundred of discuses and I have to get on

00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,790
different stresses let's say I have to

00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,010
there is one instance there is a

00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,900
five-foot louder other instance with pro

00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,470
and I have to include all these texts in

00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,619
parallel

00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:44,170
just like just like we do in selenium

00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:46,930
grid is there any option in be hectic

00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:50,650
and execute this whole suit apparently

00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:54,730
actuation in behalf I am not seeing it

00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:56,980
here in code section you can India are

00:55:54,730 --> 00:56:00,070
you too I am not feeling happening

00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:03,340
because we actually specify the base URL

00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:05,980
over here and he is there any testing

00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:10,030
reporting to what we had to just like we

00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:12,670
have faced 84 going on people level even

00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:14,680
for future how many scenarios past about

00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:17,320
how many were you actually have to

00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:19,960
integrate it with behalf and you have to

00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,980
have it if you see how about Miami and

00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:26,170
you need to install it by composer I

00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:29,770
will give you the extension if I i know

00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:35,849
i never tried already i guess it was we

00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:38,460
had HTTP formatter extension this was up

00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:42,869
it actually is you graphical

00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,869
representation screenshots

00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:16,030
but their dick it depends upon what

00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:19,380
because because S&P has very minimal in

00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:19,380
what he used to have this

00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:31,660
yes you can who is a short Bertha then I

00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,970
should see the segment and then either

00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,400
tactic like I should see this element in

00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:40,080
this region under this idea of this

00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,080
class you will move back ever

00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:51,340
but in my case you will actually use

00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:54,240
those manual plank what's the best case

00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:58,940
because you only write one kind person

00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,940
just added to me like your friend

00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:28,109
ok

00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,860
that is awful improving you can actually

00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:37,740
verify whether it was imported correctly

00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:39,330
or not that Keys edge with the mocking

00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,960
goes correct or not you can actually

00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,960
very sad

00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,700
what

00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:32,850
I do

00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,850
look

00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:48,589
new network between us library

01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:19,460
we should have the same as well

01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:34,230
has to be especially my second

01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:21,309
ok this is the last thing I would like

01:01:18,339 --> 01:01:23,349
to see which was like the world's a

01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:25,329
prejudicial saddle already of Elizabeth

01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:27,160
we might ought we to like our moon is

01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:30,609
like this when you actually run this

01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:32,410
amount in cash be hyper happy here so I

01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:34,959
already have a lot of things which are

01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:36,699
people because then I extend my google

01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:39,459
extension this was already available for

01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:42,640
me so I can just have to use them I can

01:01:39,459 --> 01:01:45,190
just replace this placeholder bodies

01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,309
like with rules and I can just use them

01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:51,099
like one good thing is by how it is

01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:52,599
given because this is given was little

01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:56,529
in the definition you can actually

01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:58,499
replace it by 10 when it is perhaps

01:01:56,529 --> 01:02:02,380
that's one thing to just identify this

01:01:58,499 --> 01:02:06,099
your reputation this attenuation

01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:08,759
actually is this part that is going to

01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:13,209
be looking for so you can change your

01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:15,579
keywords then read and keep this so

01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:19,269
these are already available lot of them

01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:21,519
actually like this is given from link

01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:25,089
its extension brother this computer

01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:28,089
extension so I can greet my elements for

01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:32,079
me it's you like I think of this I can

01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:37,859
see this I check book i use this

01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:37,859
