2007 and I'm also so here's one in the

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:33,920
 up the first thing is I'm adult

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:41,270
women too what is culpable what we act

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:43,850
is okay and I want to sweat a little bit

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,030
more about the axe architectural

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,500
components with vs and then talk a

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,929
little bit about the enemy publishable

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,220
and then also the top about hospital my

00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,560
fit into the bargain

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,570
system as well as some sort of common

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,980
areas of sort of work couldn't happen so

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,610
I was just finishing up these flies now

00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,290
a co-pilot might be a bit of an issue

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,180
there might be some positive slides I

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,280
apologize but my deep end of the

00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,290
conference I will have a much better as

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,260
I was slicing point I just wish this

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,420
collection and I'm going to talk about

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,760
reacts from a bit more of a surface

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,040
level I I know the longer you have

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,950
probably heard of plums as well which is

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:30,230
a an untouchable approach to the

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,130
difference of clothes because of this

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:40,459
car but I English worth exploration that

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:42,709
possibly in the next topic so first of

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:46,319
all what is d college group

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,879
so as a bit of history Drupal is a

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,950
content management system that many

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,890
people consider to be quite modeling

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,439
it's a traditional CMS in the sense that

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,689
the CMS provides a soup-to-nuts feature

00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,640
set this means that anything that you

00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,340
need is a site builder or a femur or

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,310
developer is all wrapped up somehow in

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,409
Google and people serves the framework

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,150
which gives you the school to pick a lot

00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,340
of things this includes things like

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,750
service that type of me and all the

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,000
market eventually grew imagination is a

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,799
server to the client as a server-side

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,849
rendering basically so there's a big

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,220
shift happening in the web these days

00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,780
which is that originally you know if you

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,709
started working with web design way back

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,150
in the early 90s or mid 90s honestly

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,579
chances are you are probably working

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,340
with flat front of NASA's HTML

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,200
Javascript CSS you upload that via FTP

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,269
you would go your realm and type of the

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,709
URL and that was like for a lot of

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,900
people's was very easy and the job

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,090
position of webmasters was great pocket

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,799
of a few mistakes when web two point oh

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,010
what really changed is that we had an

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,930
introduction of a of a mediator or a CMS

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,329
which would provide a template engine

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,680
through which data would travel and then

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,319
this template engine would produce a

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,030
rendered markup a form of rendered

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,230
market and a server-side actually

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,239
provided with that you would actually

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,460
have a thing happening at feinstein's

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,990
expect the days when javascript was not

00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:15,790
most of all support language in native

00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:19,270
browser actually approaches to a lot of

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:22,710
the methods combined in the Java API so

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:24,850
as a result indian company grill and

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,370
weapon was introduced during this time

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,870
period was a topic called Ajax

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,960
originally known as a sink this

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,520
JavaScript and XML basically we use XML

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,570
HTTP request to make calls to or

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,170
asynchronous calls to your server and

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,210
between that that you could then use to

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:46,510
replace a single bomb though or song so

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,920
for now in this web 3.0 where we're

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,330
talking a lot more about multi-channel

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,640
publishing was like a lot more about

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,110
native mobile applications single page

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,670
applications built with JavaScript and

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,460
of course nowadays Internet of Things

00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,070
applications nowadays we're using a

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,870
RESTful API as a mediator between the

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,940
server and client what this means is

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,510
that you make restful calls to Europe to

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,150
your spp I using HTTP methods and you

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,230
know oftentimes actually all the time

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,330
this would be done

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,850
you would have a less call an extent out

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,130
for client-side application and he

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,500
served with a spawn with a halo that can

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:26,630
be JSON or XML what have you which you

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,820
have been parsed into and and regularly

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,850
thought to actually provide that new

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,920
that dynamic vancomycin so what does the

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,370
eligible as a concept well you know a

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,900
lot of people call headless Drupal and

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,150
you know there's a bit of a controversy

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,770
about that because in wikipedia defines

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,020
kind of software a softer than this

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,970
amount of wire booty and we example of

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,700
this is like brush google puzzle right

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,070
so i prefer the term t couple drupal

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,410
because it's much clearer than you know

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,580
there's not just one single head that

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,010
you're a teen couple they could be a

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,570
variety of different front against a

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,010
single bathroom so this is a very

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,930
important thing if you find is that you

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,880
know terminology of course out one of

00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,130
the two big problems in two sizes naming

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,480
things right and then Pat Melton any

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,800
things we have to be right here with our

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,580
with our names to make sure that the

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,980
organ so simply put be couple Drupal is

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,320
the use of a RESTful API as a group of

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,120
that way now there's sort of two

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,740
emerging types of architectures that are

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,480
coming out of the while that uses kind

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,030
of architecture on that that uses

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,520
approach and the first is what Teresa

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,380
calls fully decoupled rule which is

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,710
Drupal serve solely as a JSON API to

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,610
serve jason bay loads payloads to

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,120
applications like your doctor

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,130
fabrications

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,840
mobile applications and oftentimes

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,660
you'll have a client-side claim work at

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
nvc our framework the Model View star

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,380
labor came over our sorry I handle

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,050
handle on rhetoric so this is often done

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,690
nice importantly in which should be have

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,030
a node.js server which the server side

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,590
whether of the text infuse your

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,750
framework on a server side to give that

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,479
official weather and then that gets

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,070
certain flavor to provide a very quick

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,490
time the first interaction you know

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:08,490
blank screen and things like SEO so that

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,650
happens in a flaky couple site now

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,360
recently I briefs published a breakpoint

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,860
blog posts call the future of the

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,229
approval which I highly encourage all

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,820
you read about the fact that you know

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,410
fully decoupled rupal has a lot of

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,120
problems so there's this new paradigm

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,680
that he proposed which is actually you

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,590
know there are some pieces of this in a

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,389
while mainly weather.com which uses an

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,090
angular which uses Drupal vendor pages

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,669
but then angular actually takes over for

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,169
the plants i trippin so in progressively

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,940
puzzling Drupal controls on the render

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,289
to provide initial page structure or

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,660
Martha or it important better

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,240
information that you might need as as a

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,639
JavaScript as it jobs would cover and

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,510
then Jonathan takes over the further

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,720
rendering

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,430
requirement myself so what are some pubs

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,140
ID couple triple well one of the things

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,450
to keep in mind is that when you fully

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,910
eat couple maybe when you use Drupal

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,200
solely as a vessel data provider you

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,200
have a a lot of issues

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:17,740
oh all right bull every day we know okay

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,780
okay TN so I so much in duple services

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,669
lost mainly things like cross version

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,200
requires security a lot of these

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,030
frameworks have not released necessarily

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,280
solved some core issues of security

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,720
there's a lot of you know discussion

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,210
happening in this community about these

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,310
issues authentication and passwords

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,620
obviously are two very important topics

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,719
for us through developers because I for

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,250
valuation right triple sauce that for us

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,200
if you use your whole bottle ethically

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,430
you know all of that sort of stuff is

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,450
soph you see one for me you know you

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,900
don't believe to worry too much about

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,160
for validation and then for users of

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,500
Drupal namely cycle there's

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,540
concentrators content editors things

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,070
like content workflow again right so how

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,980
do you use something like work a work

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,810
bench with a class I'd application how

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,400
do you have you believe you work with

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,760
these things that people are very used

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,720
to and and you know allow that to sort

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,339
of filter into the client-side

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,380
application these are they have a

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,990
plaintiff you know things like display

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,060
sweet candles those things are sort of

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,730
not really using going oftentimes if you

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,110
have a front of application you have you

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,000
know the need to actually change the

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,580
layout you're going to have to get a job

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,290
some covert ball call up your ear your

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,210
genius I'm gonna lie and say hey I

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,210
really need to change this morning but

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,730
no idea how sports also multilingual

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,680
localization so Drupal how many of you

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,380
were at the multi people session escape

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,480
I got one really awesome stuff the thing

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,160
is that you know each client site

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,690
framework

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,220
tasso approach to multi lingual for

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,800
example angular has a totally different

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,509
approach to most people so the big

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,190
problem is how do we actually bridge

00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:51,740
that gap right because Drupal also has a

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,740
client-side way of doing multilingual

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,640
hey all right so the last thing is the

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,960
last thing is successfully is x rays so

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,270
you know I want to call this one of the

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,340
beginning of the sort of new wild west

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,200
of markup in the early 2000 we have a

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,610
big you know the giant web standards

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,620
movement led by people like Jeffries

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,960
Elvin just said we need to really fix

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,180
markup and you know if you've been

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,430
you've ever heard portent decays talks

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,980
about the angry femur and now markup is

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,330
this huge issue that Rupert has you know

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,130
one of the things that that's very

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,550
important is we need to keep our markup

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,470
as robust as possible valid semantic

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,540
markup and the problem is that when you

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,590
are using X i if you hear if you go

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,720
gamecocks an application with the

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,400
classic framework then you are pretty

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,100
much on your own when it comes to dating

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,200
out things like accessibility UX I'm

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,950
really worried about the future of those

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,810
sorts of things so now that we talked

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,720
about what these things are how do you

00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:01,670
actually work with these things right so

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,710
in purple seven drupal 7 has no rest

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,600
later outer-box naming a subgroup seven

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,540
there's no way to actually read the rest

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,390
api so there's the services module dish

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,770
is a very very popular solution for

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,900
triple seven i highly agree to check out

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:19,470
as those interests national army see

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,790
interfaces exposes continuities a ten

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,070
points that you can sort of the

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,320
delineate there's also the sort of

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,690
setting module which sends it to include

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,530
all waiting types there's also the rest

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,090
of us and restful russ WS is able to

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,360
expose you know you can use the same

00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,310
half based on headers and

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,649
basically the headers work will help you

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,800
differentiate what Kate what was was

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:45,320
concerned with the bosses restful will

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,029
expose entities and eventually begin to

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,180
cater some of that data to the specific

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:53,720
needs of your fun now we're a Drupal 8

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,060
up people there so one of the things

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,459
that was very important in Drupal 8 was

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,560
whiskey and it's not i'm not talking

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,930
about I'm talking about the web services

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,420
and causes cornish did which was led by

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,850
Larry Mark Neeld AKA prom which

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,040
incorporated web services as a concept

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,779
of digital a so the core rest

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,880
modules that are in place and Drupal 8

00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:17,360
now allow for all hostilities to be

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,570
exposed mainly users economies comments

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,100
what happened and also if you going to

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,550
use there's actually into a fight call

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:30,829
rest of escort that you can use to

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:36,019
basically get a really nice view of your

00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:38,959
of your actual others great now there

00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:40,220
are many issues with rested for I don't

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,680
know how many of you may have seen when

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,540
loses blog post recently about about

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,480
rested actually last long i was just in

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,850
which talking about the rest experience

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,370
which is you know how do you know how

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,209
does it feel using our REST API using

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,529
our rest rsd API poor and what are some

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,079
ways that we can fix that so I highly

00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:01,730
encourage you to look at RX or best

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,339
experience tab the trees in group lot

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,459
work and and begin to think about

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:11,500
because ultimately those sorts of things

00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:13,640
will impact hugely the market is request

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,670
there's also one other module that I

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,230
want to one admission which is the last

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,630
so relaxing day contributed module which

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,300
extends the four rest api to include

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,130
provisions file attachments and also one

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,040
of the for the big issue

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,410
of the porous api's that there's there's

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,230
no way to distinguish between you know

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,790
basically it's very it's very much about

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,800
unique identifier second be shared

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,380
across the bar so he's employed content

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,450
and you need to preserve that

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,300
commonality this is very hard to do that

00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,710
with our last and relaxed is also very

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,270
important from the cost from the

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,430
standpoint of compensation and off my

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,390
first applications and explicitly uses

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,910
the casa de que esta so how do you go

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,140
about setting up Russell Drupal well the

00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,490
way that I would recommend going about

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,260
doing it is to download abhiyan that

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,670
desktop if you go to hockey a top calm /

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:07,300
downloads there's this is a basically

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:10,370
and a stack that you can use to

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,930
basically develop your local so those

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,840
Kingston is noted ripple site just out

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,980
of the DEA distribution and Galloway so

00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,720
just make sure that's working locally

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,510
you want to check you that that here

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,070
that's all set up and then also thrush

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,960
is the fascination show to think

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,320
download install and sees that you might

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,600
have so now if you have a working triple

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,880
site but core actually does not allow

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,340
does not enable these modules by default

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:39,770
so you want to go in and enable how base

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:42,470
it off civilization at rest now if you

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,060
want to configure to configure the the

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,950
core best you can either download the

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,840
rescue module which is actually a very

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,270
useful tool if you are a visual person

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,210
or you can also edit the yellow bile to

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:58,580
figure what's most available we actually

00:14:53,210 --> 00:15:00,850
should show that to you believe so over

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,850
here

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:12,820
so this is a site that I've already set

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:17,000
up which has cut things off sizes but ok

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,890
so if we go down here rescue I this

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,150
gives you a very nice view of how

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:25,040
actually all of your methods over here

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,530
and basically allows you to go in even

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,990
head and basically set permissions for

00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,730
all these I generally for purchase

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,470
development purposes check all of these

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,660
obviously you don't want to do that all

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,480
the time to security purposes but that

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,410
should be the idea and if you go to the

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,230
actually if you go back to the extent

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:46,400
page you can see that we have our

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:55,160
restaurant goes down here the web

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:56,540
services long history so there we go and

00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,590
then the next thing I recommend doing is

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,230
if you want to get started really

00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,460
quickly I just do it all generate which

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,170
allows you to discover ate some

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,840
constantly but we seem to have a sandbox

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,970
to be a working so just enabled it all

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,730
and then jazzy which is generating some

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:15,980
content look please close x 20 notes or

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:20,390
out early you need to get started okay

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:23,000
that was interesting okay so then i

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:26,120
would also have it open using a tool

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,910
called postin which is a very easy to

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,490
use testing will respond to profess the

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,050
rest api make sure that is provision

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,480
correctly you can get as a Chrome

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,310
extension or a desktop application so

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,680
for example this right here is fetching

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,230
a single note

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:50,149
d 1 and obviously show you very quickly

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:52,700
what that looks like ah i see here's

00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:55,600
postman and as you can see I've at my

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,529
site set up here and actually so

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,779
normally want to have some kind of

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:01,580
authentication header I'll show you

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,410
please people that looks like later but

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,329
for now because I've set permissions to

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,600
the paint on this user to just go in and

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:11,360
perform get request boss ordos if I go

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,939
ahead and pour some buses you see that I

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,589
get adjacent paperback which has all of

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:20,569
these sort of basic information that I

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:26,030
need from the dinner great any questions

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:31,940
so far away okay now the next thing is a

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:33,050
where is here we go the next thing that

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,870
we walked about that mean I want to do

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,850
is to perform a post and this will

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,130
actually allow us to create let me know

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,860
so let me actually go back to here I'll

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,510
show you very briefly what my current

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,340
content looks like if I go to the

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,670
content view you'll see that I've got

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,320
some notes here and you know there's not

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,770
really you know this is this is

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,320
something else even for now if i go to

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:59,780
Bozeman and I go to this you know if we

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,580
created the bus that I have and as you

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,130
can see I'm using based off as a way to

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,110
authenticate his revolt oh I think the

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,460
robust and if i look at the headers

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:12,309
you'll see that it not about my off of

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:14,809
my token here and if i send a robust oh

00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:18,950
sorry i used to put in some information

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:24,110
here so we just go back here this is

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:27,429
really not the most fun but if i go in i

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,429
go do this

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:40,899
paste that in there okay and then I am

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,000
you know here's the here's his type of

00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:51,039
I'm gonna do let me make the title

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:53,909
drupalcon by and no scuffle ok so now if

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,370
I go over to a nice and this request I

00:18:53,909 --> 00:19:02,620
get to it when treated SAS code and if I

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:06,220
go back what you'll notice is I know how

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:09,970
do you know drupalcon by which says no

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:13,029
service right great so now we know they

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,880
can do things with just you know

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,110
basically doing crowd on those if you

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,350
want to be more about this as a whole

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,940
lot of information on drupal.org about

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,320
this and I'm going to sort of stop down

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,870
here and move on so if you want to help

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,250
you know if example by through through

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,159
the rest of it you can do that very

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:37,630
beautiful ok so that's a very quick

00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:40,299
introduction of the basics of how to set

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:42,610
up the ecology and I think that you know

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,380
what if it was very important at this

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,360
point is that i was using the core REST

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,179
API as it exists right now on all

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,919
cosmides normally a lot of times your

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,559
API needs will be a lot more extensive

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,919
than what pour rester bikes and it's a

00:19:53,559 --> 00:20:00,100
very good idea philosophically to to

00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:02,049
design an API expect before you actually

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,610
begin writing class on application

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,139
because you know you don't really know

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,440
who's gonna use the API you want to make

00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:09,460
sure that is robust as possible before

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,900
so with that in mind that's why I want

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,760
to introduce the public drupal

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,800
so we set up a school group over for

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,450
dinner yet so with that in mind now we

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,270
go ahead and dig a little bit so yeah

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,250
and once again this is you know it's

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,680
going to move pretty quick but i think

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,270
that overall i want to give you a big

00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,860
picture of what's going on and at some

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,450
point grey suit on how to get help we

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,020
pose you can access the castle of this

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:37,720
stuff already built in so what is the

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,500
act well i think it might help to start

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,230
by talking about the sort of history of

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,460
reactor we have to started in 2013 if

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,260
you think about the progression of

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,410
various black site networks and how they

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,610
evolve we have to sort of the beam it's

00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,820
really quickly growing popularity

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:57,430
because this prepared with moshe state

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,620
its kool occasion of tablets with

00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,930
geologic and it's really sort of

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,970
anything is an opinionated this move

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,950
hard work other than native this about

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,900
Staten what that means is that we act

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,000
doesn't really care a whole lot about

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,560
what you're using in terms of your model

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,810
controller or using the + architecture

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,870
what's your doing fully over dispatcher

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,370
and any reaction so in the last few

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,840
years of much larger ecosystem is

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,710
growing around the axonal topic about

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,570
that was game so Facebook literally

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,700
calls me act a library for building

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,100
composable user interfaces with we

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,990
usable components so these components

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,350
can be nested they can have arbitrary

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,920
hierarchies and many people choose the

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:41,890
ticket we act as the V in NB c NB c v

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,880
the novelty of acrylic our time and you

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,130
know that a lot of people argue that

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,240
that's not about the best description i

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,780
think it's very useful thing standpoint

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,010
d by google so because they act as a

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,230
library there are a lot of starter kits

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,790
that you can use if you just google be a

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,470
starter kit there's like a million

00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,800
results that come up there's not really

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,110
a canonically sort of standardized set

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,360
of libraries to use you sort of have to

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,910
confuse investigate based on your

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,920
preferences and you're sort of beans in

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,360
this presentation I'm really hopefully

00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,700
going to talk about we have because if I

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,900
talk about starter kits or if I delve

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,840
into a whole lot more it's going to get

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,940
really messy so what are some

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,710
differences of reaction a lot of

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,690
frameworks it's often times people say

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,090
it's not really useful to compare react

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,280
to MVC frameworks or enjoy these larger

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,850
scale frameworks but I actually think

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,170
that the place where there's a lot of

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,420
overlap in terms of how we can compare

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,390
them is thought this is manipulation of

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,340
the bomb so traditionally you know up

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,670
until about obviously about two years

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,150
about a year ago the sort of traditional

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,890
NBC 5 07 / lollipop oh and angular you

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,679
know they used a different approach and

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,660
two-way data binding but they also need

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,480
to apply changes to wrap them talk and

00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,640
so if you've ever use angular 1 how many

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,440
people have ever seen like dollar scope

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,200
in angular 1 and mess around with that

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,240
had been for your hair up right this is

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,340
like one of the big problems with anyone

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,820
is that actually if you look at angular

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,009
it was originally

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,840
exciting thing working so but unique

00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:16,399
ability late a whole lot of condos it's

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,720
really it really is a big problem for us

00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:21,330
react uses what's called a virtual dog

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,909
which I reverse was an abstract gone

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,139
because there's a whole lot of other

00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:27,090
solutions out there for the same kind of

00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:29,850
thing mainly from el blog which is a

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,649
google project and it's an abstract dog

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,200
which allows different states a new UI

00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:36,029
to eat it against each other and so what

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,190
happens is using this dip we act

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:39,929
basically tastes that dip and figures

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,559
out the most efficient way to the

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,899
delayed thought to to basically keep it

00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,399
performance really hot I'm not going to

00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:48,389
date to ritual dog there's a lot of

00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:51,179
resources if you want to learn more

00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:54,120
about it now what are some drawbacks of

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,500
react well you know it is before to get

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,059
her presentation unless I popularly

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,370
about the disadvantage is why you might

00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:02,039
wanna reconsider reason we act if I've

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,710
been you know convincing already react

00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:07,590
as theirs is not a one goddess released

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,330
yet of we act which means that it's

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,279
still very unstable if a lot of changes

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:14,850
that are happening it's not you know the

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,179
most easy thing to follow in terms of up

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,259
a pack up a pass and so there's a lot

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,299
that is thoroughly oh there are quite a

00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,600
few back works apparently making changes

00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:28,710
in the air we have tools are challenging

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,269
also because excuse me because there's

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,259
not a you know there's not full coverage

00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:37,769
of the stack right what that means is

00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:41,490
that as opposed to let's say angular or

00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:43,289
or or ember in particular you really

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,799
need to figure out your own way to do

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:48,690
certain things with yes so plus

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,190
architectures a lot of imploded talking

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,650
about those and there's also the

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,870
the redux trademark which is basically a

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,490
very popular approach to folks

00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,980
architectures that I had a parachute

00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,960
check out as well also one thing to know

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,400
is that we act has a bit less focused on

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:09,100
a component support maybe or two will be

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,080
able to anyway I leave with Oliver and

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,240
ever actually has explicit roadmap for

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,610
one photos because of WPC

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:21,610
recommendation there will be support for

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:23,190
what we found ok so i wanted to talk a

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,150
little bit about how to set up we act

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,830
and i'm going to move through this

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,360
pretty quickly but i do want to note

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,730
that once again i want to talk about

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,260
this from a very high level I've taken a

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,660
lot of these examples from a very

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,330
influential 24 waves article called

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,650
Universal vs by Jacob I Jack Franklyn

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,090
which is actually a very very good

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,940
resource in terms of learning about

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:45,640
isomorphic exposes the JavaScript namely

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,870
jobs with a process that so if you want

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,960
to start from scratch peace is what you

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:53,890
want to do is just another project and

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,230
basically use these the install it's

00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,080
about argument to provide certain

00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:01,470
vibration confuse so for example the

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,420
same flag will save it into your

00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,520
package.json file as a dependency that

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,410
you need for for production or four

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,420
pills doc for development right so

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,640
things like developer tools like gulp or

00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,370
grunt those are not considered

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,990
appendices with the safe for the for

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,950
both houses you want to use

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,530
say that so next thing is that where I'm

00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,990
going to be talking a little bit about

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:29,160
es6 or yes 2013 ecmascript point of T

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:32,640
here because I think it's very useful to

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,990
further reduce of these concepts of es6

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,630
it is conference as well in order to do

00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,360
that we battle and that will you know

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:45,370
has got a lot of flack maybe because

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:49,900
it's quite quite though how's the

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:53,920
problem sometimes so in your babble the

00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:56,110
lrc configuration file you want to make

00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,200
sure that you have your yes point 15a

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:01,660
and new yawk setting so that jsx which

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,300
is the template language that riac uses

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:08,440
and also the s6 can be transplanted to

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:10,240
you javascript are to run across we're

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,179
also going to use an express server to

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,679
actually get this going and the reason

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:17,080
why is because we want to provide some

00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,730
server side rendering maybe we want to

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,960
provide that initial state and not have

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:25,540
a blank page when you start looking at

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,740
your application and then we'll also

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:31,750
want to use me out router which is a

00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:33,640
very popular solution for rally so the

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,020
end of all of this you're happy about

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,970
JSON file should look something like

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:42,370
this under dependencies and def

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:45,130
dependencies now in terms of setting up

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,110
Express you want to set up a server

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,520
Dante's file which will basically you

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,860
know how's expressed and what's

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,080
happening here is if he goes these

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,240
import statements are basically calling

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,510
other modules on you know elsewhere

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,900
to actually inject those dependencies

00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:06,470
right so what's happening here is if you

00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,030
notice actually doubt in right here this

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,100
is what's called an arrow function and

00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:13,010
if you're familiar with novice functions

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,370
in rural or untrue anonymous functions

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,420
in JavaScript sorry it's going okay

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,890
anonymous functions of JavaScript that

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,500
arrow functions are basically the

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,960
managers function and then rack and rest

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,300
as your arguments that your pleasure or

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,330
using that motion what this is doing

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:32,260
basically is it saying let's set up an

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:35,690
express server let's execute it let's

00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,520
basically create less let's use our ejs

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,470
sorry legend I'll show you weekly how

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,809
about how the most in terms of setting

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:46,700
it up and then on every single and get

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:50,420
requests basically the wildcard asterisk

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:55,460
says any any rap right we want to render

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:57,260
index okay and then we have our category

00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,670
i we have our server and you know

00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,790
basically we can you know get the

00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:07,370
console log out it shows that we're good

00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:10,429
right so the okay this got a little

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,990
messed up okay so this is they were for

00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:15,140
expressing our Georgia team although we

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:17,210
need to actually save it as you / in

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:21,260
there Spock ejs this is just me dias

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:23,510
para and what this should be I'm sorry

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:28,690
this is messed up but it should be an

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,690
HTML file you know just oxide HTML HTML

00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,070
title and then of course you are your

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,930
body and if you've gotten this far you

00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,180
should be able to set this up and you'll

00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:41,830
people see your espresso actually

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:43,660
serving this HTML so the next thing is

00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,600
you can start a server locally by

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:50,050
executing server ojs without a note and

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,240
then it natl you have it's all cool if

00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:59,800
you're using the the G flat and if it

00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:03,180
actually was just use value ok I am very

00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,530
sorry these examples are so messed up

00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,900
basically what's happening here is we're

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:11,290
going to put in this thing right here

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:14,740
this markup a variable which will allow

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:17,350
us to basically replace a markup with

00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,760
other mark right so what's going on here

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,430
is that we're quite a shop for our

00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,810
application to line we have our head and

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,760
title which is where this hello world

00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,400
title is and then we have our body lift

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,960
the body we have div ID app and then the

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,780
market which will actually be a place so

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,400
anything that's inside this app did is

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:37,750
going to be our location so the next

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,000
thing we want to do is to do some rowdy

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,770
and this is very important from their

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,230
classes it would possibly want to have a

00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,340
bowlful has no application so just be

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,150
that we don't just want to have a home

00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:51,610
page and that's it so the way this works

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:54,330
is that we're going an export and object

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:57,120
that contains on routes and set up

00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:00,610
basically a hierarchy of that's

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,440
basically the / route and the / notes

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,490
route are pointing to the index

00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,500
component and those

00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:09,429
especially in this example and a child

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:13,570
out of the overarching path right people

00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:16,450
Russian Russian then in our server ijs

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,980
file underneath those import statements

00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,470
we want to import the act to provide

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,210
server-side rendering service at

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,179
execution of the act we wanted to

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,120
Leonard a string which is a feature in

00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:29,050
react on which allows us to basically

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:35,020
concatenate all of our stuff together

00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:37,900
and sir single single swing of HTML

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,070
markup super fine and then we have

00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,840
router we want to put some of those

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,250
dependencies and finally one include our

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,440
house is good we exported if you

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:50,470
remember from ljs now here's our first

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,850
foot so we at operating with components

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,760
right now if you're familiar with we

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,300
asked you might have seen this before

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,830
except that you might have seen

00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,440
something like we asked lock create

00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,450
class we're using optical image

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,820
JavaScript here for Slovak week

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,770
javascript is the misnomer because this

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,380
protocol hair is and also on the

00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,140
connotation in JavaScript now that's a

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,740
debate for a whole other session but

00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,820
ready helo story line is we're giving a

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,500
word of setting up we have component

00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,000
called a path one which is our

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,440
overarching component which will house

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,660
all of our childhoods and upon render

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,290
we're going to give and this right here

00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,790
if you're seeing this HTML within the

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,710
within a short statement this is

00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:36,190
actually called jss which is the

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,929
collision of that react you so the app

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,980
will do is it will actually interpret

00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:43,169
all this now put it into a

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,360
series of JavaScript objects and then

00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:50,400
that will be what what is actually

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:53,340
excluding in the browser or you know on

00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,780
your server so this got crosstalk

00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,960
children refers to the child components

00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,059
which are accessible from this component

00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,020
so basically any any other component

00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:05,730
that we're building is going to live

00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:07,650
inside this happen or so let's so the

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,530
first component that will in a bill that

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:13,620
is indexed upon now once again if I go

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:17,280
back you can see that this top pops up

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,270
short is going to be we're assuming it's

00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,090
going to need where that a nice

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,160
component with ice specially so you can

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:26,400
see how the commonest of all reasonable

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,480
because its concept kind of wars now and

00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,929
in this case we're just going to return

00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,750
a very easy a string will be doing which

00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:35,580
is welcome to the home page and then we

00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,370
also have another component which also

00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,410
lies inside we have component which is

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,159
an MBR knows we comb and calming it

00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,899
knows the opponent

00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,460
eventually we're going to affect I

00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:48,269
should note or catch some of those it

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:53,039
sorted out to you and provide some

00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:54,450
information to be asked so we want to

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,789
make sure that when we do server-side

00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,429
rendering that our server when you set

00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:01,139
it up when Express actually nice cubes

00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:02,369
we wanted to recognize all of these

00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,570
components as well because eventually

00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:07,529
they want these components to be

00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:10,289
executed and the editable on from from

00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:12,990
all the client side immediately as if it

00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:17,399
was a quick paper and we don't want ppl

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:18,659
basically my terrain yok join so what

00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,369
we're doing here is after our routes

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,889
we're going to include our components

00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:27,799
and make sure that those are pressed as

00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:31,109
well now further doubt we this is a

00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:33,419
summer class camera that is also taken

00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:36,109
from that that 24 ways article by Jack

00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:41,270
Franklyn what's going on here is that

00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:43,440
we're providing basically various

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,770
handbooks right so if you have a

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,589
response code of 500 you know we have a

00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:51,839
redirect or if you have props which

00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:52,980
means that you are actually have you

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,339
actually have a valve component

00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,500
surrender then you'll invoke writer to

00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:01,530
strain and this I'm sorry this should

00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,350
actually be routing context in

00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,790
without being conscious capitalism but

00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:08,700
that basically what will happen is you

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:11,850
will you will this will render all the

00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,110
routes and services that makes that's

00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,640
better this will render all about the

00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:18,330
service sites so we have over the potus

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,460
also render officer side and then we're

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,410
going to send that if you a call the

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:28,020
original app get a function that we had

00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:30,150
this is this function that we had was

00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,470
just remembering to the index view but

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,330
if you look here we're providing this

00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,460
additional argument which is Martha and

00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,610
if you think way back to the next aki

00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,650
jas with the you know angle bracket

00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,260
percent that is where that market ball

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,300
goes and then of course if there's

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,190
nothing at all then you want to have a

00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,660
fluorophore and chances are you want you

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:54,240
might want have a unique you before for

00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:55,380
that you write your son okay so the

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,540
other thing that's really probably about

00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,030
me after router is the concept of

00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:04,890
linking so you can actually we can

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:07,890
provide a a navigation bar with their

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,720
application navigate these graphs and

00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:13,069
once again these should be capitalized

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:17,490
as I will fix these slides and put up

00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:19,079
have this session and so what's

00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,759
happening here is that if you think

00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,359
about what a proponent will look like

00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:25,259
right imagine that you have a massive

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,180
appetite and then you have your

00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:28,980
navigation bar which is you know a part

00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,539
of the happy one and then further now

00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,279
you're going to have your other

00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:34,230
components namely it could be indexed

00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:35,670
opponent based on the index route or it

00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:40,529
can be no sleep on a basis in those

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:42,390
around okay so then the next thing we

00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:43,920
want to do is once again this HTML is

00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,710
really messed up the next thing we want

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,779
to do is to provide some pie segment

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,279
because not only want Summerside married

00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:53,130
in a sense of having our initial state

00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:55,170
our vendor servers we also want to allow

00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,940
further we buy drinks take place in the

00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,710
client side right so we watch the

00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,380
loudest want us to sort of dynamically

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:03,059
change based on new data comes in and

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,559
it's all so forth so what we need to do

00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:09,720
is we need to make this happen plan /

00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:11,430
blog so you want to create a client ijs

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,020
or quietly even makes whatever you want

00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,730
these

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,700
we actually put this in spite the

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:18,980
sensitive about that so you want to

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,500
import reacts and we act on the router

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,790
for clacks I routing and also and also

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,670
our routes as well so we're going to

00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,950
have basically isomorphic browse on both

00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,330
the server and the client and then also

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,760
you want to use create browser history

00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,050
which is you know part of the html5 this

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,200
weekend which will allow things like

00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,300
back button functionality and and things

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,310
like that and also artifacts are our

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,880
routing that also provides a means of

00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:46,430
doing things like apartment and then you

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,040
want to renders right and you want to do

00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:53,570
this in one apply this to the app the

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,490
app I need it which you saw earlier now

00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,500
what's most important is to build our

00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,480
bubble to production if I our JavaScript

00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,640
so that we only servicing without your

00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,550
file because you know we want to have a

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,990
baby having eight and if i'll read a

00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,160
script so let's use web pack for that my

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,690
pack is currently one of the more

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,540
popular solutions you can also use

00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:14,540
browserify if you so choose and this is

00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:17,120
the config file of Carlos for web pack

00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:22,190
what we're doing is we're going to

00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:24,560
provide a client j/s on file as the

00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:26,270
input which will basically make web pack

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,430
take all of those import statements and

00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:31,280
basically put in all of this fantasy

00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,290
that we need so what will happens at the

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,430
end of this will generate yes file which

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,579
will be stiff will be used by the

00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,589
browsers actually

00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,229
XP wellness jobs or point of clients as

00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:42,269
well so now this is a very key point you

00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:44,339
know now we've got there's a better

00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:46,410
server side stuff all wondering all

00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:48,630
working late and that is the surficial

00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:51,420
state of our we act on vacation with

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,489
client side which is just flat market

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,619
that's great important you guys just

00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:56,700
flat part right that what's happening is

00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,549
we're going to we're going to execute

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,489
this product is the client side and this

00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:04,380
will basically take over from there and

00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:06,690
confuse the market with your activity

00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,430
that we all know by the way there's a

00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,259
bigger there's a very good concept in

00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,630
client-side framework technology is

00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:14,400
called rehydration you'll probably hear

00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:17,789
this more on the end or regular context

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,670
in which after you provided that initial

00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:22,979
server-side provided markup rehydration

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,380
involves let's catch some the new

00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:27,630
updated data and then update that

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,640
initial state of the application you

00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,559
know it has a beta data with this new

00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,900
that so you've always got a new state

00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,690
we're application regardless of what's

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:41,239
happened and then we're going to execute

00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,239
webpack and that will be wrong address

00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:50,910
okay so now with that in mind how do we

00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,140
set up we asked to work with the top of

00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,970
your right because that's really what

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,380
you all came

00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:00,680
so the first thing that you want to do

00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,690
is that you want to allow react

00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,400
application to have access to Google

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,260
backyard football if you're here we have

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,190
application assisted on a difficult age

00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:12,920
which way to being slightly you need to

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,050
allow that repression happen and people

00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,810
will not just elaborate busting a domain

00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,250
for security reasons so there's a

00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,990
variety of ways to do this you can do

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,480
this actually two there's a you know

00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,830
their place with it in and next there's

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,510
a variety of ways to do it and it's

00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,520
beyond the scope of the session but this

00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,600
is just one example and and you know

00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,160
obviously there's a lot of security

00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,400
concerns which are we have a pie plate

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:39,290
by typing in terms of thinking about

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,870
cross water across and now with rest and

00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:44,540
we act in order to make calls make less

00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,950
calls to our Drupal rest api i can

00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,840
recommend using super agent which is

00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:52,070
something that wordpress calypso also

00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:55,130
uses to make API calls to Sumer quest

00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:57,260
API it has a very web api is actually oh

00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,120
this is very probable to Jake Whitney X

00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,270
but if you don't want to use jQuery as a

00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,550
fantasy which we are not in this case

00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:08,990
then use Duke wage message wasn't much

00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:11,240
more like a solution so let's pick the

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,710
some of us let's be one so about a like

00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,550
half an hour ago which seems like 30

00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,109
years ago we need a get request to note

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,989
/ 140

00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:25,730
format people's facebook to actually get

00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:27,049
our JSON payload back right now let's

00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,470
make this happen with the super asian

00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:33,079
right so there's a couple of important

00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:35,839
considerations here the first is you

00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,150
walk to you and you know everything a

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,640
measurable a video and impassable right

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:43,009
and you're using reacts universally

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:48,289
mainly nice more complete on a process

00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:49,700
back fully coupled anywhere bus did you

00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:52,730
make during a suicide are gonna be

00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:55,249
seniors like so during the executor that

00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,539
we asked during the execution of that

00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:59,029
server side JavaScript you're gonna make

00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:00,230
API calls me and there's a very sort of

00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:01,999
there's a lot of these cases where the

00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:05,660
snakes that's right imagine that you

00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:07,579
have a cricket website right and you're

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,680
and you've got some information for you

00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:11,390
you've got some stats that have you know

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,940
the scores of all of the recent matches

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,589
right that is gonna prolly be served is

00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,029
something like MongoDB it's very greater

00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:19,309
than that a Drupal is not the best

00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:21,499
handling this is really great sort of

00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:24,349
small scale time but then we might have

00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:26,239
you know some articles that are served

00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:27,440
through Drupal about like such a

00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,749
gentleman or something like that right

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,789
you might have these Leo this content

00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:33,619
that needs to be set out from Drupal and

00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:35,150
as you want to have your application so

00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:36,320
it could be that you're using MongoDB

00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,900
the

00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,580
he s tak and you also wanted to make

00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,990
these rest api calls the server side to

00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,300
drupal to specialist content so that

00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:47,300
they will side by side in their reaction

00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,310
application now to make same as

00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:53,390
requested as the greatest or surrender

00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:55,990
the sort of that sort of the most common

00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,760
way to do this is to make the request on

00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,870
quieter to the indication of rennet is

00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,460
right right so you want to make this

00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,950
request before the actual string

00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,200
concatenation happens and that makes it

00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:08,390
part of me is rendered market this is

00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,430
talk because the way that components

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:14,330
work in conjunction with better swing is

00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:16,280
a bit little in that it's kind of this

00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,720
video is it's not very clear where the

00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,020
process you can actually make this

00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,750
happen so to make this really easy as it

00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,530
as make this very sort of clear what I

00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:31,420
what I've done is to use this approach

00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:33,740
in the VIP API what it did not which is

00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,300
you know oftentimes used for both

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,490
synchronous mainly on the server side

00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,990
masking service line and a single class

00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,810
named on the client side when you

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:43,880
execute yet and you can finally hits

00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:47,210
earth outer universal talk with this

00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,850
approach so if we go all the way back to

00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,260
our dose component rightly remember this

00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,180
is what it look like originally right we

00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,970
had our this is another page this

00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,370
implies ecnl and we have a runner our

00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,840
render function right we want to add

00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:03,470
some additional functions here because

00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:07,390
this will allow us to use the oxygen so

00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:11,210
if you look here what we've done here is

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:12,860
where where that we've added an

00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:16,220
additional import statement which is

00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:18,750
super easy we've got we've provided a

00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,940
get initial state which is going to be

00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,530
sort of initial blank State Park

00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:26,130
employment right this is traditionally

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:28,260
how we define sort of base default state

00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,730
of each bar components and if you look

00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,830
we have our kind of a body oh yeah

00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,270
that's it now this is this is kind of

00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:35,490
this is kind of pseudocode headed pestis

00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,500
and I you know I will provide a code

00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:40,200
base that you know so this may change

00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,330
please don't copy paste this or or use

00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,500
this right now but what's going on here

00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,750
is what we're going to do is in this

00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,680
component in math education we're going

00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:53,220
to get super asian and use super agent

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,060
methods to actually get our Jason Taylor

00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,160
so what we're doing here is where we're

00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,170
doing get requests against that half and

00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,940
dribble we're studying the header which

00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,960
is a SAP application based on and in

00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,900
this case we're not going on vacation

00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,180
because if you recall we opened up the

00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:12,210
permissions to all non excuses all that

00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:17,820
they request against then we're going to

00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:19,650
basically provide a a oh sorry this is

00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,190
actually wrong wow this is a this should

00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,570
actually save them here but anyway so

00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,910
what's going on is were actually side of

00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:29,100
the state by providing by traversing I'm

00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,590
Jason Caleb and getting the title body

00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,570
for the time this should make sense

00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,890
conceptually even if this code is not

00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,850
correct I think it's actually should

00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,980
make sense what we're doing is we're

00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,080
going to get the request work with a

00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:45,030
performer request get our gala diversity

00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:48,210
payload providing that is insane after

00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:51,660
all of that if it errors out we want to

00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,310
provide for the server bus and then

00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,670
finally or any actual render function

00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,800
we're going to return this state final

00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:01,320
right because now our state has changed

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,560
right so anytime we are making this

00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:07,680
request we act will say oh okay has this

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,750
changed as this change right based on

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,160
and where it performs these requests and

00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,410
as a result we're going that we're going

00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,390
to get much more update with that now

00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,309
I'm going to warn you right now this is

00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,470
a very very simplistic example and

00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:21,030
probably not usable in real world just

00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,369
because the fact that many people

00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:26,400
recommend using plus to do this new

00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:28,650
depressional flow of that so I highly

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,319
recommend if you if you do want to delve

00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:33,119
a lot more deeply to how this would work

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,230
look at flux and those sorts of

00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,640
approaches it's a little bit beyond the

00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:41,190
scope of this session okay so with that

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,930
in mind running out of time so I so I do

00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,369
you want to sort of end with some food

00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,130
for thought and just some sort of larger

00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:48,660
considerations that you might want to

00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,730
consider when the publisher goal and

00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,440
using we act as we find you can use any

00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:55,650
front of anyone with the public group

00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,300
doesn't matter and you know it said they

00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:02,220
are all very very compelling these cases

00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:04,589
to approach so the first is I want to

00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,290
highlight a couple of these case in the

00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:09,840
wild that I seen that

00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:12,870
becoming the first is the wakame side

00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,670
which was a very decent and there was a

00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,830
big article about it on my blog I highly

00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,260
liquid ninja we divided this is a full

00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:22,080
ed Kabul rest application that is built

00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:25,470
on an oj s tak against a couch TV

00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,740
database which replicates which is the

00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:30,330
rest api is used in front of you and

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:33,690
this you know is good for piece of

00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:36,420
caching and things of that nature in

00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,770
terms of present decoupling you know

00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,140
this idea is simple constructing the

00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:42,330
initial page structure and then allowing

00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,250
a job for navigation tango or totally my

00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,610
drink this is a very compelling concept

00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:49,470
as well and you can see this in you know

00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:51,900
things like yeah he views the react

00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,660
module the Drupal for example or there's

00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,470
a very interesting POC product called

00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:00,540
rupal we ask loss which I anchor to

00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,000
check out it's on it's on github my game

00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,900
that happening and then the other

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,580
unfortunate plug example of this is

00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,140
better not commonly used in angular

00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,540
front end to take over from the triple

00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:12,150
render that's providing service on in

00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,920
terms of sort of you know more fully

00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,120
develop applications where you still

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,260
want to provide some awareness so

00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,140
through pulse render pipeline and some

00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,910
information drupal could provide this

00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,490
important information about Drupal

00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:26,890
server-side render to a JavaScript

00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:28,000
application right and so for example I

00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,410
would highly encourage you to check out

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
the rest of panels of multiple disgust

00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,530
response prime sessions morning and it's

00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,330
a really really interesting solution

00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,640
namely that you have sports of

00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:39,010
information about panels through Jason

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,250
to to the job application which Adam

00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:43,600
uses that to construct the page and so

00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,710
this is a very very interesting idea

00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,870
because it means that you no longer

00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:49,960
believe you can have your site builder

00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:51,760
you know use panels in and use the ribs

00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,440
actually change the column lists but

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,270
then export that the client side and the

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,880
client-side application will use that

00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:59,980
information intelligent there's a whole

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,110
lot of interesting approaches that are

00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,000
you know that really are sort of cross

00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:06,010
sector and you know it's a very

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,400
overarching question we're wearing a

00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:13,210
blog line like do we just serve gear

00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,830
data for Drupal just content just these

00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,510
companies do we serve some renner

00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:20,230
information like restful Caltrans and

00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:22,150
that we actually give some information

00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,020
about how there's how these things would

00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:28,520
appear on the server side you get worse

00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:30,350
by sight or we actually do more

00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,060
aggressively probably where the classic

00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:34,670
framework is very much a part of and

00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:37,720
inside people there's a lot of different

00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:40,760
discussions that we can have whichever

00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:43,220
one last thing I wanted on is that

00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,440
reactors not alone we act as part of a

00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,930
larger ecosystem of open source projects

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,280
that Facebook has been working on and so

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:52,370
two projects that I do want to highlight

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,590
in our reactant rocky well I gave a

00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:56,780
small mini session at the aqua booth

00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:59,540
yesterday about crafty well but

00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,250
basically these are two very common

00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,500
approaches to things like that

00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:05,840
especially which which could be very

00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,110
interesting because you know one of them

00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,520
there's some weaknesses of the way we

00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,370
build additional Eskimo architectures

00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,010
today so what I want to do is just

00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:17,540
highlight wrap you up very quickly

00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,220
there's a Drupal member above the jewel

00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:22,250
contributor named Cooley was working on

00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:24,500
a rocky wall server for Drupal which is

00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:27,770
a very very nifty and compelling idea

00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,680
and I urge you all this project because

00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,570
it's going to be

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,250
really interesting approach to that

00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:37,960
affection from Drupal itself and so what

00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,650
I want to do before actually gangs that

00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:46,240
slide as I want to just very quickly

00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:48,340
show you a quick a very quick video of

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,420
what rocky wall does as a demonstration

00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:56,020
of some of these things that that we've

00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:58,450
been talking about I showed this video

00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,000
yesterday the mini session but so what's

00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,310
happening here and this is sort of the

00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,630
way to ask rockaway all these

00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,460
considerations you don't need to use

00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,620
rest as a transport saraly when you're

00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,570
using crafty well it could be soaked be

00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,100
something else we've got news about our

00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,960
custom content i believe it is

00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,130
conference and a couple of custom feels

00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,230
that reason okay it was actually a

00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:23,770
submitter business system is a neighbor

00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:25,510
request that will mirror the response

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:27,400
you get back from the surgery so we're

00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:31,420
doing here for example is we're filing a

00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:35,590
request against the enemy is any of no

00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:37,030
ID and getting back only that guy one of

00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:39,550
the big problems with a lot of rest api

00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:40,440
settees too much information or too

00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,000
little information

00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,310
if you're talking about things like have

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,450
a watch application for City a single

00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,490
page application they have different

00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,230
data tease and oftentimes we want to

00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:51,030
talk about you define these endpoints

00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:54,780
making sure that our message points are

00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:56,730
art pottery efficient so what's

00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,589
happening here is that rationally Korean

00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:01,290
use this is the traditional at massage

00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:04,410
content leaves in Drupal and we're only

00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:07,800
getting those conferences that are in

00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:09,180
that are held in Europe and what we're

00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:13,230
going to do even further estate query

00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:15,960
also fetch also the additional custom

00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,400
fields that we have as well so graph pol

00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,440
is a very very interesting with that

00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,700
example and one of them just one of the

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,790
very exciting things is happening around

00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:26,790
the map ecosystem and if you're using my

00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:29,550
back already d public way with your

00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:31,050
Google site you know you're actually a

00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,170
leg up in terms of being able to

00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:39,450
actually use for a few well as you're

00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:44,310
clear sort of a crushing for your point

00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:48,210
average and so with that in mind I want

00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:49,619
to end weekly with see just let me go

00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,950
and there's also aliasing as well as a

00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,950
message

00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:04,759
yeah okay so let's go ahead and go to

00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:07,779
last slide which is on there's a little

00:53:04,759 --> 00:53:10,069
big debate like knowledgeable which is

00:53:07,779 --> 00:53:13,519
should rule about the client-side point

00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:16,190
work in order to basically keep a lot of

00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:18,250
the stuff that baby tight and enjoy with

00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,900
your bowl and is useful site builders

00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:23,299
this is going to topic of several blog

00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,279
posts by based lately so I want you to
