I have my colleague be shaken hands with

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:09,000
me we both work for up here and our

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,860
session is scaling Drupal 8 and we

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,870
believe that after attending our session

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,269
you will get to know about it lots of

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,630
good techniques how to scale large

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:26,970
circle websites and small-scale websites

00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:30,539
within the limited infrastructure hi

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,250
guys so the session topic is scaling

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,710
Drupal 8 i'll talk about scaling and

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,350
having will talk about to be late that

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:44,329
word ok so a brief introduction both of

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,500
us being work at Acquia and we are

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,270
currently working with lightning team

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,640
I'd be working lightning and even some

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:55,160
very good start there so if you guys are

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,160
interested we are hiring come to a booth

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,120
so like I said we want that the topic is

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,119
came to great but I think it's essential

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,030
for us to understand what scaling or

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,750
what optimization is and why is it

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,280
important at how and I briefly covered

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,930
what are the general principles of

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,290
optimization and why should we do it and

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,270
then we will get into Drupal 8 specific

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,970
things what are you into plate and we

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,670
will see a small video in the end which

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,000
will show some good stuff that Drupal 8

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,119
has in terms of optimization so what is

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,960
website optimization website

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,820
optimization is basically process or

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,549
things that you do to make your website

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,409
roll faster but the question is why do

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,259
you want your website to load faster is

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:53,549
it important at all what did I think is

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,890
it important however it is it little

00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:04,470
important or very important

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:08,970
and why is that traffic I don't really

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,830
care user experience I don't really care

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,660
about Google induction language I cannot

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:18,800
money I care about my sales do you think

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:24,710
that is one impacted by a slow website

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:29,840
why that's right

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:32,420
so there are data to prove that Amazon

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,370
found that every 10 milliseconds of so I

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,220
hundred milliseconds of latency cause

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,160
the one percent of their seats and one

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,320
percent of Amazon's sale is a big deal

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,850
right and we had this talk about 100

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,370
milliseconds and Google found an extra

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,040
five seconds originates drop of traffic

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:55,690
by twenty percent just the matting

00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:02,060
twenty percent of the traffic of Google

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:06,230
right it is a big and just point five

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:09,560
seconds so now you might know how

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,320
important it is to lower yours and your

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:17,480
very fast how fast should the website

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:21,350
now it should lower sooner than you

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,310
think your eyes right and we wanted to

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:30,080
grab it to reducing tuple is a very fast

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:32,860
no why why do you think why do you think

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,860
of is not fast

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,890
so triple is not fast easy this question

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,990
is very subjective if I tell you drupal

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,980
is very fast and serving earnest request

00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:53,040
is that true drupal is not so fast in

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,330
serving authenticated request but can

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,110
you tell me something which is very fast

00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,480
in serving of the Decatur inquest know

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,730
right there's nothing it is really fast

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,160
in serving authenticated Pacifica's you

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,940
need to break your page every single

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,140
time but for unless because you can do a

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,340
lot of things you can get away with a

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:19,890
lot of things we will see all that let's

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,710
see little graph though x axis the

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:26,880
horizontal axis is your patient time in

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,670
seconds and the vertical axis is the

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,240
percentage of people who abandon your

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:36,390
site so if your site loads it in four

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,520
seconds you will have a traffic drop of

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,460
twenty-five percent which means

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,680
twenty-five percent of people are not

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,180
are bouncing off from your side because

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,470
your site goes in four seconds it's a

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,830
big thing to a five percent of in

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,830
traffic

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,680
when we talk about our optimization

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:02,870
there are two there two major aspects of

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,930
it one is how much your server can scale

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,810
or how much request your server or your

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,740
application stack and deliver content

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,979
you right and we generally focus their

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,509
might I should have a form of servers

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,330
and it should be able to serve all the

00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:24,580
requests but even if you do that there's

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,580
one ask your site can still be very slow

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,620
imagine I've had you know Lord God

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,360
server high steel server and and still

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,880
my sign is slow do you think that can

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,830
happen and why would that happen right

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:50,030
and why would network interfere in your

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:52,419
site speed because the way you have made

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,949
your application is not very optimal

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,380
there then there is a lot of things

00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,740
server has only a very small part to

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:04,400
play in a request response cycle it just

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:08,419
delivers the page eighty percent of time

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,729
is spent on the network the HTTP call

00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,469
that goes to the server and the response

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,830
that comes back eighty percent of the

00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:19,039
time is spent in the network and rest of

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,330
the rest of a small percentage yes it's

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,430
not a small percentage but a big

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,310
percentage in rendering or painting the

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,680
beach your browser also takes time to

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,099
paint your page and I'm not sure if you

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,680
know this how many of you like bama this

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:38,479
a lot and how many of you hate panels

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,150
like equal number people hate panels and

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:46,360
equal people like vandals who hates

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,360
panels and why do you hate panel

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,710
and why is that

00:06:52,889 --> 00:07:03,509
see Jules has to lose things on the

00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:06,240
server side it has enlisted nested tips

00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:09,599
if you have her if you guys would have

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,620
added in modern DK session he wants to

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:17,520
take out every single day that he can

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,770
why what is the disadvantage of that it

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,779
takes a lot of time paint your into the

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,199
render your age the render time goes

00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:28,949
very high and that's a that's one thing

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,300
which kills a lot of web pages and and

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,580
you find this problem with a lot of

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,069
people sense because people use panels

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,069
heavily without even changing the DBS

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:40,650
and at the end their ph the server might

00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:42,210
be very fast but the at the end the

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,400
peace does not appear to be very fast

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,400
isn't me it takes a lot of time to

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,469
painting the page also the right Joss

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,870
them in a not so nice way in a very

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,979
blocking manage and javascript is the

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,389
biggest culprit in your big spin time

00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:00,770
we'll get into details of all that but

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:04,050
some basic stuff that everyone should do

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,460
in optimization of demolitionists then

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,680
you need a very special districts a

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,979
specialist job look at a website at that

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,939
what are the problems and how to solve

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:16,710
them and the first thing that you need

00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,469
to know when you are optimizing a

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,779
website and find the bottleneck do not

00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:24,089
go around optimizing everything because

00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,969
every kind of optimization comes with a

00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,399
costume right if you are adding a

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:30,810
reverse proxy in front of your side

00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,449
there is a maintenance overhead if you

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,890
are adding a load balancer or I replica

00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:37,800
database as a mood maintenance overhead

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,539
so always know your requirement find the

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,990
bottleneck and then solve the

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,829
performance problem but besides that

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,449
there are certain things that everyone

00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:48,449
should do not doing these things is a

00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:51,000
crime and that's what I'm going to talk

00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:56,430
about and then we will talk about Drupal

00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,769
8 and understand so never said never

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,929
send uncompressed content to the browser

00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:06,619
your browser can become prez content

00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:09,019
content in in a jiffy very little time

00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:13,369
but it saves a lot of network bandwidth

00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:15,499
and apache has a mod deflate and engine

00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:17,660
X is very good at compressing your

00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:19,569
content you can do that or the server

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,850
level you can also do that on

00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:24,980
application level Drupal does that

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,329
advance cash module does sorry advanced

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,670
I'd we get a module does that for you

00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:31,129
but I would recommend do not do it on

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,569
application level try to minimize the

00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,429
overhead of the application to it on the

00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:36,860
server level and if you're using engine

00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:38,929
X engine X has one more we will feature

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,499
that every time it compresses a content

00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:44,600
it saves a dot gz extension in the same

00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:47,329
location next time if you request the

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,489
same content it will try to find an easy

00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:52,339
locate the gz extension if it finds it

00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:56,869
in and serve it so it not compress the

00:09:52,339 --> 00:10:00,170
content again again combined do not have

00:09:56,869 --> 00:10:01,879
too many CSS and javascript always

00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,739
aggregate that trooper does this for you

00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,959
you don't have to worry about this but

00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:10,279
make sure writing a code in such a way

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,829
to not add a lot of conditional code in

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,490
modules what people generally do is hook

00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:18,799
in it and do black chairs on basil some

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,420
condition this is that is not a good

00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,269
thing to do unless you really need to do

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:28,639
it because more conditional jess that

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:29,959
you add there are more advanced

00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,170
irrigation will have to create more

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:36,799
files based on pages what it does is it

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,779
creates an aggregation file based on

00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,610
certain page if you go to a different

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,199
major on which side irrigation does not

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:46,189
is not valid if you have to pay da

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:48,589
things another aggregation so try not to

00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:50,809
add conditional JavaScript unless you

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,699
really need to do it the best way to do

00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:57,679
it is in do is to add in the info file

00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:59,059
you make as less acidic request as

00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,069
possible this can be achieved in

00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:04,209
multiple ways like the previous one

00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:08,839
combining Jason CS is in a single file

00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:10,519
try to use prides sprites you guys know

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,300
what is what is the sprite you combine

00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,970
all your small

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:19,720
into one big image and then you it is

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,730
you save a lot of network requests

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,080
maintaining sprites is a big overhead so

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,300
what you can do is there is a module in

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:32,990
Drupal 8 tuple called css3 in bed you

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:36,980
can always embed your images into your

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:39,740
CSS file using base64 encoding if you do

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,290
that you do not have to maintain sprites

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,829
it is not supported in 97 and lower

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,450
browsers but if you support I 7 and rose

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:53,839
then you will have to be inspected

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:56,269
there's no other way so and then always

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,630
have JavaScript at the bottom never on

00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:01,760
the door because JavaScript works in a

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,300
blocking manner when a JavaScript

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,310
Resources requested it will block other

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,690
context from being being delivered so

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:15,050
try to include John Hsu there at the

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,529
bottom using sprites avoid iframe I

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,510
think we have call ready covered this

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:25,450
always use a CDN how many of you know

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,450
what is a DOS attack what does BOS means

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:41,760
that's something which my grandfather

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:45,210
used to use not even him you are a

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:50,130
grandfather in terms of experience and

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:52,740
knowledge so yeah enough service and how

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:58,710
many of you have faced real challenge

00:12:52,740 --> 00:13:00,740
with that right and our VR application

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,690
developer site we do not we are not

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,860
server architecture architects like a

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:10,050
stupid of us as appear we are but so it

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,030
is not your applications job to find out

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,010
in Animal Services and block IPS and do

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:17,610
things like that right Syrian like

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,070
Akamai or cloudflare will detect dose or

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,260
D dose needles is distributed in our

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,720
services it is smarter than those

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,990
because with dos attacks you can block

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,020
the IP address end and you and that

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,270
attack is gone but t dose is more

00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,070
complicated they have different packet

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,200
patterns they have different IP

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,110
addresses and everything is spooked so

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,840
it is not easy to detect and and and

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,690
check so these series they have

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,700
expertise in doing this plus your server

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,900
all your static resources will be served

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,150
from the Syrian you don't have to worry

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,330
about it about them all into worry about

00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:57,720
is the only HTML request that comes to

00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,590
your page which which involves Drupal

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,140
and other things no static resources

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:06,900
reduced DNS lookup it is sorry another

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,170
point is always use cookie free domain

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,080
not lot of people do this you have a I

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:17,280
have a domain called example com I serve

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:19,920
my CSS jas and images from the same

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,940
domain but you know what happens what

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,000
happens is every other request has

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,710
cookies attached to it what is the use

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,550
of cookies in images can you tell me do

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:39,370
you need cookies in images no you need

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:42,250
Cookies judge in CSS and cookies

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:45,220
a seat ibiza you know the format of is

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,290
TBD right so it will increase the if you

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,210
pass a cookie and if you are using

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,060
application like drupal your poopy you

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,700
might become a become a little babe so

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,160
around 4 kb or five QB you're wasting

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,890
with every request instead of that if I

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,230
have example.com I can create them in

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,779
like static dot example calm and make

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,390
that the main cookie free all your

00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,220
static resources will go from static dot

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:13,720
example.com which will be cookies me and

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,720
you will save at least 500 kb or pita on

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,720
every phase it will not fire it k me but

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:24,300
200 to 300 easily so always use cookie

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,730
free domain reduce dns lookups do not

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:30,880
have a lot of domains to be looked up in

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,650
your web page like do not have

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,070
third-party domains like i have an

00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,630
example calm some some other website

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:41,200
facebook.com google.com if you have add

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:43,080
more of domains what happens is there

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,910
has to be a dns lookup and it takes time

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:51,430
so the more number of domains you add to

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:53,580
your web page the more dns lookup will

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,900
be there and hence the slower page

00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:00,790
remove duplicate assets i have seen a

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:04,150
lot of sites outside triple where jquery

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:07,839
is included twice some people one jquery

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,880
1.8 someone wants it going to Jake with

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,350
no concrete and add another Jake way do

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,670
not do this do not add to placate

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,990
resources use expires headers I thing

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,100
everyone does that mean we generally do

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,450
not have to worry about it because

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,779
Drupal takes care of all these things

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:25,410
but it is good to know to deal with

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:28,330
expired headers expire hitters and etags

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:33,640
makes are very important concepts to be

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:36,130
aware of so I have you see another time

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,440
but it's the same thing always use a

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,510
reverse proxy I don't think I need to

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,570
talk more about this because anyone low

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:47,020
knows what a reverse proxy is and if you

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:49,410
are if your user base is eighty percent

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,420
anonymous you should always

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,430
seventy percent knows you still using it

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,290
was well you should use reverse boxing

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,569
in any matter even if you have hundred

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,459
percent introduces reverse proxy will

00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:02,610
help you in a lot for example one ish

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,740
will same things in memory and even if

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,589
you are requesting a static resource

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,720
there has to be a file item which is

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,909
still expensive more expensive than a

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,079
memory look up so always use reverse

00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:18,329
proxy memcache has a lot of utility in

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,819
Drupal and outside Drupal reward people

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:25,140
to pulse we use radius mother key value

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:29,659
store radisys state persistent memcache

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:33,270
is what I but we generally use memcache

00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:35,549
what happens with memcache is we map all

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,530
our cash tables into cash wins in

00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,630
memcache so instead of a database

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,150
request like even when your page is

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,520
cached Andrew you still have a database

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,990
request going to the cache tables which

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,900
is nothing but a key value store your

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,970
cash tables are a key value store so you

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,220
can have those key value stored in the

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,169
memory and memory to look up will be lot

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,570
less expensive that your database

00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,909
lookups always use memcache and you will

00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:03,390
find that all your page starts loading

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:06,150
lot faster off cash comes built in with

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,460
PHP now so just enable it and you will

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,220
see a significant difference even if you

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,380
do that in your local machine database

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,900
indexing it is a separate subject in its

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,010
own it is one of the most complex part

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,669
of optimizing an application but it is

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:25,440
also the most important part because

00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:27,659
most of the time of a request on your

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,059
server side is spend on the database PHP

00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:32,010
only takes thirty percent over time rest

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,360
sixty to seventy percent of time is

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,700
taken actually by the database

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,730
especially in Drupal so if you have

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,890
unindexed tables it's going to create a

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,350
lot of problems for you like you need to

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,990
find out your views what are the queries

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:49,770
that you generally use interviews enable

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:52,380
slow query log in my sequel and try to

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,210
find out the slope queries and try to

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,100
optimize or do indexing around those

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,460
queries and you will find a significant

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,960
improvement in your

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,510
application there is a script called DB

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,030
Tudor available on d dodo download that

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,710
and try to use that on your site and it

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:12,320
will give you a good insight of what is

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:16,010
wrong with your database so till now we

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,070
talked about anonymous user mostly

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,850
authenticated user optimizing

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:24,620
authenticated user is a big challenge

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,790
till seven it was not an easy task how

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,420
many of you think they have that very

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,550
good job in optimizing for authenticated

00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,700
users I don't think there's anyone

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:37,250
neither mean but there were certain

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,210
things not really worked really well but

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,490
it was still there and there are a lot

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:47,540
of examples which are for example blaze

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:51,710
meter used to use or cash what what

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:54,530
caster is it has to try to cash the

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,960
static part of your page and the dynamic

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,600
part of your page will be there will be

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,430
token left on your page when you when

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,770
the page request is sent and those

00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,900
tokens for your authenticated part of

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,450
your page is replaced to a subsequent

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:14,360
Ajax request that's how odd cash works

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:16,700
correct me if I'm wrong okay so that's

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,530
how our cash works what it happens is in

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,390
your web page everything might not be

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,420
dynamic there will be certain blocks

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,730
which are dynamic there will be the

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,320
header section where you have hello

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,590
admin has a hello user name there were

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,510
certain blocks and some part of some

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,980
part here and there otherwise the page

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,580
there will be another section of the

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,620
page which is non dynamic so you can

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,010
still load the page and serve the

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,900
dynamic part later in an AJAX request

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,420
this worked pretty fine but it was still

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,920
like you will notice that yes there will

00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,470
be page and there will be some static

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,610
component there and after sometime it

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:58,160
used to change there was not a very very

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,850
nice user experience but still it it was

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,050
doable and you can and that's how people

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,810
used to optimize authenticated user

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,660
gooble seven at least the smarter way of

00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:13,050
doing that or cash also has an odd cash

00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,690
yes I module do you know what is ESI how

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:20,610
many if you know what is ESN inside its

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:22,770
I include what earth cash yes I will do

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,380
is you don't have an AJAX request now

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:28,860
you have an ESI and that ESI component

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,930
will be will be fetched for the dynamic

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,390
part rather than any jacks request so it

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,980
is a better way than this now this one

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,260
more thing called big pipe which I will

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,060
cover later and I will show a small

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,250
video on this there is something which

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,800
is going to make a Drupal 8 very

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,110
interesting so we will see that later

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,030
and this is this would be the way to

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,670
optimize your route 88 application and

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:53,010
it's pretty nice we'll talk about it

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:58,620
sometime later back to knowing to teach

00:21:53,010 --> 00:22:00,300
you to some other things some are the

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:05,610
big performance improvements in Group A

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:08,070
late we have we we have now as a system

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,740
in code that will provide the lot of

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,450
functionality out of the box so we don't

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,900
need to take addict to manage the assets

00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:18,660
or CSS that whatever they at whatever

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:22,470
the level they were get altered and so

00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:25,590
it was a big problem for the Syrians 44

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,260
varnish at the varnish level that got

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,290
cash it the whole pages we have the

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:36,090
entity cachet how many of us known about

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:37,920
the entity keishon module d7 yep it's in

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:42,150
the code it's all functionalities in the

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,690
court and caching is enabled by default

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:50,310
in the standard and the minimal profile

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:52,320
and all the assets and the CSS CSS

00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:59,730
aggregation javascript javascript

00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:02,160
aggregation is unable by default so how

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:07,800
many of us know about the cache API in

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:12,120
Drupal 7 how many of you aware about

00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,720
cash a get or set a lot of us that was

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,210
the cachet

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,020
it's just a fancy name you use it every

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:25,420
day so how many of you have faced issue

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:30,070
with kasia get cash a cachet said and

00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,480
you one of you like cash a clear all i

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,720
like it i have to take it take a side

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,120
down and there's something volvo

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,080
something which is very interesting is

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,180
if you enable devil module and look and

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,270
enable queries on your page you will see

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,910
the slowest query he's the one which

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,470
acts area which which is to the cash

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,570
table I don't know why it is very slow

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,870
so there were problems with cache API

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:59,840
and drupal 7 so the cache API in Drupal

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:03,110
8 was not doable 7 was not so robust but

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,230
it in Drupal 7 it's more of us then was

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,180
in Drupal 7 it is designed like for

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,640
handling for the earth it not for the

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,280
anonymous users but only for the

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,650
authenticated users as well but the

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,650
caching system for the anonymous system

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,170
is same as in the Drupal 8 that was in

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:24,080
rupal 7 so there is nothing more change

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,650
we think for 40 anonymous caching but it

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,610
has been changed for the authenticated

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:34,220
authenticated users so there are a

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:37,970
couple of things that caching cash API

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:42,140
has so can we have cash it we have cash

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:48,890
attacks can shake on text and cash a max

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:54,140
age and for when invalidations can

00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:56,750
X so it when evering rupal 7 we if

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,580
something is something sometimes we want

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,670
to clear the cache a wee wee wee

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,130
directly do the cash a clear all so

00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,630
that's not the right way it was going

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,980
the clearing the cache a for the whole

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,930
of our site or our application so in

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,230
Drupal 8 we have cash attacks here for

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:18,110
adding the data dependencies for the in

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,360
the rendered renderer is that that this

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,520
particular this particular part is

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,750
dependent on this particular entity or

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,900
so so we have cash attacks a cash

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:31,300
with us for manage the dependent on the

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:36,880
data or the configuration that we have

00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:40,540
suppose I have a module with a blow that

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:45,850
is displaying the Facebook like box so

00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:48,580
how so in Drupal 7 but we need was we we

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:52,090
just passed it constant there trooper

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,870
location do we know drew / no cash a

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:59,020
constant yes so in rupal 7 it was also

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:01,270
the same or that if we don't pass any

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,750
any constant there by default it will

00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:08,020
add the max cash a message that we will

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,720
discuss later that if we want to

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:13,120
explicitly not add adding any cash a

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,100
metadata with any of the things then we

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,770
can use the cash in max ate there so in

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,540
Drupal 7 we don't have any anything

00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,580
render caching or fragment caching with

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,030
us with what we were doing is we were

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:30,160
fit we were saving our whole of our HTML

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:33,280
page and we were saving it either in our

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:41,950
cash tables or at CT or at garnish

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:45,910
levels or at our CD ins so get cash cash

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:50,400
can be varied by variations from from

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:53,890
permissions to roles to urls to from

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:58,510
from user roles to anything so for

00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:00,940
handing those for for handling those as

00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:05,080
well as for excess checkers we have cash

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,300
a context here so we can we just need to

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,120
add the ketchup context with our

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:15,100
fragments or our renders render address

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:18,850
that we have so we we will add the

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:23,290
dependencies that that this context this

00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:25,560
this particular part is needs this will

00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:28,990
be buried by this variation or so when

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,130
the cache API will take care of that out

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,960
of the box so dynamic

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:40,070
h cash is one of the module which is

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:42,290
doing the same for stem stuff for us so

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:46,550
Ketchum exhale as I was saying earlier

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:49,150
that if we want if you want that some

00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:51,740
render address to outlet explicitly

00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:54,470
ourselves that sometimes we explicitly

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,570
want to clear the cache it like I

00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:00,110
already said that cash a clear all

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:02,330
function that we all like so so we can

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:05,450
add the cash a permanent or cash

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:08,600
analyzer so one more thing with the

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:12,860
within within this cache API is that we

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:16,640
have services with cash a all the caches

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:22,190
are services in Drupal 8 how many of you

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,350
know about this services yeah so we can

00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:28,310
replace out all of our caches system

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:30,800
with any of the system will I so don't

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:35,230
don't do that cash a back-end love so if

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:39,770
we think it will set the cash in donor

00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:42,050
so we have big pipe so that that

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:45,020
improvement that idea came from the big

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:47,780
pipe so so forth implementing the big

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,500
pipe strategy we the cache API got

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:54,770
introduced and lot of the improvements

00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,540
got included into this so so dynamic

00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,940
page cache was one of the major step

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:03,100
towards Deep Web so big pipe is rightly

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,780
not in the core but it will be it

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,210
already there is an issue introduced to

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:13,720
introduce this module as experimental in

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,720
8.1 now abhishek will proceed with the

00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:23,920
thanks so we will look at different kind

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,720
of caches that are present in rupee

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,250
like for example there's something

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,140
called page caching which is similar to

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:32,130
what we have in total seven it has not

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,810
change so it gives yo caching for

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:38,740
anonymous message at pages and it works

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:41,500
similarly to person we did some

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,600
benchmarking we use it to watch a

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:48,160
benchmark to benchmark and see how

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,380
caching works for anonymous user and you

00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:55,620
can see there are 67 requests per

00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:58,120
seconds but when the user becomes

00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,770
authenticated the number of the

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:04,810
conference it reduces with the the page

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,620
load time increases if we add more

00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:10,660
concurrency so it's doing fairly well

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,430
there's one more concept called dynamic

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,250
page caching which is new in Drupal 8

00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,890
this was not in double seven okay we

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:22,330
talked about or cash dynamic page

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:25,030
caching is similar to that so it is

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,340
again enabled by default into parade it

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,920
has some kashmira data that it leaves on

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:34,000
the pages when it is being rendered and

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:38,520
then that part is the dynamic part is

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,460
literal later on field later on with

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,920
Ajax request or ESI so it is similar to

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,350
earth cash that we do where we talked

00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,130
about earlier so benchmarking with

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:54,940
dynamic 8-bit caching also gave us a

00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:58,390
pretty good result what is interesting

00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,430
is big fight which Naveen was mentioning

00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,670
earlier it is generally for

00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:05,890
authenticated users one thing that big

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,830
big pie will not do is it will not

00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:11,730
increase your it will not decrease your

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:14,710
page load time by the way so there is no

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,050
no difference in page load time you will

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,990
see after including after enabling big

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:23,260
pipe so what is the advantage of using

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:26,280
the pipe so if the page loads in if the

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,810
document already fires in three seconds

00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:33,070
after including bit bit by bit is still

00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:35,250
fire in three seconds so why use big

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,250
fight

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,870
yes so there's something called

00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:49,760
perceived optimization we will see a

00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:52,010
small video in which we can see how the

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:57,530
same page load but the page looks really

00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:58,970
different so so like yeah like like we

00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,250
have in the slide during entering the

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,470
personalized part are send on later

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,140
there is something called flush and OB

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:10,490
flush in PHP how many of you know what

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:14,540
is a flush in PHP so what flush does is

00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:17,570
it will clear the output buffer the DA

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:20,030
architecture has changed a lot from d7

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:23,510
in d7 this was not possible indeed you

00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:26,420
can flush the output so what the end

00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:28,820
check what tuple does here is it will

00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,460
generate only the static parts of the

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,920
page in the building and it will leave

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,960
the dynamic part for leader once the

00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,570
static part is generated it will flush

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:43,700
the output and the output reached it is

00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:45,950
just to the user now later on the when

00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,830
the dynamic part is calculated when is

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:52,250
rendered it was it will send it to the

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:57,050
client again this is how flush in PHP

00:32:52,250 --> 00:33:00,500
works and I personally tried to lose duo

00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:02,510
be flush in Google 7 was not able to do

00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,130
it if I could have done it it would have

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,830
been a great thing wit is not possible

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:10,730
into the seven and Drupal 8 we have big

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:12,320
pipe now it's very interesting like we

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,170
did some benchmark I did not find any

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,990
difference in a batch of inch month with

00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:23,440
big pie but here is something which will

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,440
tell you why is big pipe interesting

00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,530
sorry

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:40,450
so here we see a page with some dynamic

00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:42,850
content on the side and then there's a

00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:46,600
comment which is again that personalized

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:48,820
content so on the left side we see

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,960
traditional on the right side we see big

00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:56,440
pipe now he is seeing this for cold cash

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,179
coal cash means the cash is not

00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,279
generated the cash is not warm and it is

00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:02,679
written so six point five minutes the

00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:07,029
same time but you saw the difference now

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,190
when the cash is warm most static and

00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:12,580
dynamic part loaded the same time the

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,349
page load time is the same but you see a

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,270
difference but if you tell someone which

00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:17,470
page is noting fast what would the

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,750
person say in the left side or the right

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,500
side so this is called perceive

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,500
optimization

00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:40,680
yeah there are some certain tools which

00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,630
you should be aware of if you want to do

00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:45,750
some performance optimization for the

00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:48,180
front end side the easiest way is Google

00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,370
PageSpeed always refer the whole page

00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:53,010
speed inside and if you have a score

00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,660
less than 90 your website is not good

00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,570
and if you have something less than 80

00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:00,060
your website is bad season into

00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,520
something about it why stores another

00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,710
good pool it will give you lot of

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,980
recommendations both of these tools and

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:10,140
all you need to do is just follow those

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,710
recommendations other very important

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:17,040
part is I have seen this happening very

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,990
a lot in India than other places what

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,880
happens is designers give you images and

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,370
those images are very high quality

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,730
images and the developers they will just

00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,890
put the same image in the server Drupal

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,680
villa yes optimize it drupal will make

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,270
some changes but it will not it will

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,240
still not optimize it as much as you

00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:39,690
want it to so it is always a good idea

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,500
to optimize your images like if there

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:47,580
are some designers in this room is there

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,290
any designer in this room no ok so if

00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,890
you meet a designer you ask him to

00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:55,350
always save for web never do is save in

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:59,040
Photoshop if you are creating images in

00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:01,530
Photoshop always do is save for web what

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,110
it does is it optimizes it for the web

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:07,740
it removes all the metadata which is not

00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:10,920
acquired and the images are optimized

00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,540
there are some tools available I have

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,430
not mentioned that i will probably

00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,350
mention it later there are some tools

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,300
which some script which i found which

00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:20,580
will optic just optimize all your images

00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,560
in your size default files directory

00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:27,240
once i ran that too and my websites and

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,920
living a very fast apache venture mom is

00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,100
a good tool forced resting but do not

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,810
consider bacha benchmark results as the

00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,670
exact speed in which the site will be

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,670
rendered to your to your

00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,750
users because with abacha benchmark

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,060
you're doing it locally it is it is just

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:49,120
testing the latency of the server it is

00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:52,390
not testing the network or the browser

00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,340
rendering and so it is a very net your

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,350
tool for that and you need to understand

00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,330
that it is not meant for that what you

00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,910
need to what you can do with a batch of

00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:03,640
inch mark is you can stress test your

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:07,450
server you can see how much stress

00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,190
concurrent users it can handle right and

00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,260
that is different from what you

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,120
particularly users how fast the pages

00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,160
for a particular user so if you want to

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,050
stress test yourself is a good tool if

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,800
you want to stress test your server

00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,360
jmeter is a bad movie by the way now why

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,920
is emitted a bad tool for stress testing

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,240
your server now jmeter is a good tool

00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,910
for stress testing you survive is j

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,560
meters installed on the same server but

00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,290
if you are i fine with my local machine

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,010
I have a jmeter in store the nums and i

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:42,750
am trying to stress test a server on a

00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:45,730
queer Club it's a bad idea because my

00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,010
network bandwidth will exhaust lot

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:52,080
before the server will reach its limit

00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:56,320
right so how do we solve that problem

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,510
something called blaze meter it is place

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,320
meter is an enterprise version of jmeter

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:04,900
its its Jamie Rahn cloud so what it will

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,430
do is it will do jmeter tests to your

00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,800
server from different geographical

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:12,850
locations on the across the world with a

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,610
high bandwidth connection so we'll never

00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,140
reach that stress and you can do stress

00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,540
testing of your server so if you want to

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,610
really stress test yourself you might

00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:25,710
want to check out what please meter is

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,710
that website is made drupal by the way I

00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:33,810
think that's the end of the session if

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,810
you have any questions please ask

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:47,280
questions was it that man it's not a

00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:52,040
part of Corps yet it's a separate module

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:55,050
it will be part of coral input 1x

00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,600
probably not even i'm not sure top it

00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:00,270
will be by basil there is already a

00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,880
proposal for that but it's up to the

00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:05,790
government there is a contributed module

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,190
which you can use it will give you and

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:11,910
you will not notice a lot of difference

00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:14,490
in a page which is slightly dynamic if

00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:17,550
you have a high dynamic page like if i

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:19,290
had a pitch like my Facebook Wall big

00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,630
pipe will make a huge difference but if

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:24,540
you have a default Drupal installation

00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:34,830
page like home page you won't notice

00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:37,490
much difference with big fight so how

00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:41,400
can we identify that is views either

00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:42,990
buying a slow so yeah so in my sequel if

00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,120
you go to my road CNM there will be a

00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:48,780
configuration which enables robbery law

00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:52,530
and you specify the path of the slow

00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:56,630
query if you are too lazy like me then

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,630
you can use the Viper profiler module

00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:09,480
look at the query and try to find bad

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,280
joints try to remove bad joints and if

00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,390
you really can't remove any joints try

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,000
to index your database with the fields

00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,680
that you are the where clocks you will

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,330
find some fields that you are accessing

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,110
try to improve those wait

00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:35,150
in the index of the tingly Jeff pretends

00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:39,860
that so explain will tell you a lot

00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:42,710
about like each feels it doesn't tell

00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:53,380
you what how to fix it it's also where

00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:55,790
to start looking thanks so imagine me

00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,940
Apache benchmark is a very small tool

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:02,630
which is shipped with your apart your

00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,460
Apache for the budget and it's very

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,700
small it's like it's not even full

00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,140
fledged stress testing two it's just you

00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,770
just give a patchy benchmark some

00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:15,020
parameters and it will make a network

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,050
connection to the website very simple

00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:20,510
come online tool for easily doing some

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:24,020
kind of small stress testing or see how

00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:28,460
fast the site is loading jmeter is more

00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:31,970
full-fledged unit er stress testing tool

00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:35,330
and it's java based application which

00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,250
you run it gives you a lot of lot of

00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:41,050
things that even like for example in J

00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:43,670
in J meter you can you can mimic how

00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,190
authenticated user will be on them for

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:49,310
example I can you will find a lot of

00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:51,230
jmeter scripts called gmx on github

00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:54,320
which will be meant for drupal which

00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:57,410
will be meant to stress test drupal's

00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,690
for example authentication or creating a

00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:04,790
note creating a user all these things

00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:06,530
you can right steps for create for

00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,320
creating a user and you can run the

00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:11,360
replay those steps using jmeter and it

00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,870
will it will exactly mimic how user will

00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,870
do it and with a stress of 500 users

00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:19,910
thousand users also you can ramp up in

00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:23,330
jmeter like you start with one user and

00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,890
ramp up slowly and then come down apache

00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:27,800
benchmark will just burst all the

00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:30,100
requests if you have conference of 10 10

00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,470
bursting you cannot ramp up or random

00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,870
planes meter is just jmeter hosted on

00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,460
cloud like for example I do not use my

00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:41,540
local machine general my local machine

00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:43,520
to stress test and Acquia cloud

00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,570
environment servo Napa toward

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,570
environment because after cloud will

00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,070
have a high network bandwidth and it has

00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,860
more completion capability than my

00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:57,080
systems and the bandwidth at my system

00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,690
has so for example my bandwidth will be

00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,090
10 Mbps so other maximum amount of

00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:05,150
stress which I can I can give to the

00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:07,250
service 10 mbps right but that is like

00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,110
nothing for a server hosted on any cloud

00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,450
environment so that is a bad way to

00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:14,600
stress test that so how do you use

00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,400
jmeter to stress just a live server you

00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,340
can use blaze meter place meter is just

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,380
an enterprise version of jmeter and what

00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:25,520
place meter does is it has several

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:27,680
several locations George jirafa colloque

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,730
Asians just like any other CDN works it

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,830
has geographical location where they

00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,540
have blazed me to install you can choose

00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,910
different geographical locations and

00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:38,660
from there it will have a high bandwidth

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,460
stress on your server and in the

00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:44,240
bandwidth not will not get choked so

00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:49,060
that's what it is thank you any more

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,060
questions yes please

00:43:51,930 --> 00:44:02,559
these reasons are for example I want the

00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:07,680
user to do poor condition is not good

00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,680
for my dear oh my

00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:20,820
then how do I learn the cross and even

00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,820
the site must be wise

00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:36,940
I did not follow that very much okay

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:59,660
okay I think I understand your question

00:44:45,700 --> 00:45:02,330
so I think she's talking about yes I

00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,760
think the one she stood where is the

00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:07,250
minimum cash back time and if you said

00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,890
that what happens is the cash will not

00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,450
expire before that time so if you are

00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:13,910
scheduling and content to be published

00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,650
in that amount of time it will not

00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,050
happen because still that time your cash

00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:20,320
will not be updated so only after your

00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:23,990
cash is updated even if you run cron

00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:26,180
your scheduler will run and it will be

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,370
published in the back end but your

00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:31,310
friend but your cash it is not available

00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:33,950
in your cash because you have set

00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:36,290
minimum cash lifetime so the ideal thing

00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:42,560
is never set minimum cash lifetime to so

00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:44,600
high what you're asking is aquas inside

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,390
will tell you that you set up that

00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,390
selling ignore that that's bad advice

00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,230
one more thing I want to

00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,370
you

00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:39,260
right so I think selectively or clearing

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,410
the cache of the side as what are the

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:54,010
same from that runs the schedule might

00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:58,610
do the trick yes that's very beautiful

00:46:54,010 --> 00:47:01,490
all right any more questions but I want

00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:03,320
to add something here that there was an

00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,360
issue that God committed in eight point

00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,920
one point X that on running the crown

00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,920
they cash will not get clear

00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:22,500
yeah so one customer on she's actually

00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,640
doing some real estate languages of the

00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:31,430
sheen shampoo and I would probably add

00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,430
the page or the pool

00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:55,359
or there is one more option that you can

00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:56,680
do but do not know this if you have a

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,720
lot of content which is being created

00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,099
very often is whenever there is a

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,230
content which is published through

00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:05,200
schedule of you can use rules and you

00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:07,839
can clear the cache through it whenever

00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:12,700
a condensed for example your are using

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:15,670
work wins moderation okay just okay said

00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,050
you look so you can use rules and you

00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:20,280
can find out whenever content is

00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:24,720
published just clear the homepage cash

00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,720
so that is one on the way to do it

00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:50,150
yep invalidations will automatically

00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:53,090
take care of that that services if you

00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:54,950
want to extend that service and want to

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,620
take care of any want to do something

00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:01,280
other stuff or to clearing of other

00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:03,100
thing then you can do that as well but

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,540
service decorated is the best option

00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:23,000
instead of extending that service yes

00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:24,680
please yeah let me rephrase what you

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,680
said you said that when you we are using

00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,870
Syrians we make extras call to a

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,600
third-party side which is a senior right

00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:36,230
we do not make an extra call the Syrian

00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:38,690
sits in front of your side and what it

00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:40,790
will do is it will take care of most of

00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:44,300
the requests when you're considering a

00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:46,160
request when you request a simple simple

00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,440
page google.com do you know how many

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,900
requests does it make it will make more

00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,310
than hundred requests one will be that

00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,490
request of the document and then there

00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:58,040
will be JavaScript CSS images and

00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,340
whatnot so there are at least 100 HTTP

00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:04,250
requests which is fired by one simple

00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:06,650
request that you make so what CDN will

00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,450
do it will take care of all the static

00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,730
request if you make it static cache of

00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:13,070
all these things so your server can do

00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:17,720
what is meant to do what is your server

00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:20,420
is meant to serve HTML pages right

00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,490
through drupal drupal at the end android

00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,950
HTML page right other things are

00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:27,020
statically request which has nothing to

00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:30,320
do with drupal unless you have private

00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:32,330
files so this CDN will sit in front of

00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,910
your application and will take care of

00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:37,910
everything including attacks like de las

00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:41,410
dos attacks or security attacks right

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:45,020
and it is not an extra quality it's just

00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:47,060
something in between and it's just just

00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,010
proxies the legitimate request to our

00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,120
server that's it you will do the same

00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:53,610
thing if you have a reverse

00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,630
proxy for example if i warna sh it does

00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:59,430
the same thing it proxies proxies the

00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,190
request to Apache whenever it cannot

00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:23,640
find a cache she didn't pretty much does

00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:27,330
the same thing some do it but your CDN

00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,040
can be as when invisible and can be

00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:31,740
rendered through the regular a bit of

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:40,170
the W domain which renders the rest of

00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:42,920
the site at the same time you should add

00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:48,420
editions of your static from an extra

00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:50,730
lot of site using cdna maung right that

00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,340
is because you do not want to serve your

00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:55,230
static resources from the same domain

00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,410
where you are serving a dynamic requests

00:51:55,230 --> 00:52:02,490
because that has cookies so you create

00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:04,890
another CD n dot your domain com so that

00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,240
and that trade-off is not too bad you

00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,980
are just adding one more domain lookup

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,490
and it is not even a domain lookup

00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,900
because you're just sub demeaning it so

00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:16,500
it is not even another domain lookup but

00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:19,050
you are saving a lot of extra headers in

00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,320
terms of cookies that's why we have this

00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:24,500
see the end or side to side name.com

00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,500
stuff like that

00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:37,119
can we catch the rest api cash rest rest

00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:41,299
api stand yes why not how exactly i mean

00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:44,180
not aware of it so rest api like if you

00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:45,799
are toggle is this one okay so it has

00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,770
what it does is on the view layer

00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:51,339
everything what you need what you're

00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:54,890
generating as HTML you're just

00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:57,020
generating it as a jason right the view

00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:59,630
layer only changes everything else

00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:02,480
beyond that remains the same and you're

00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:04,099
caching happens there it's not page

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,900
cache gap if you run about page caching

00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:08,990
it is different from that but you're

00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:11,869
caching happens before the final render

00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,970
only the rendered changes right tuple

00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:15,799
everything ultimately goes to the render

00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:19,579
function which renders it at ease at so

00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:21,770
atpl also adjacent ready only that

00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:25,039
changes be below that everything is the

00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:37,250
same so it can fit into the tuple

00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:41,599
gajender yes yes so like if it was an

00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:42,270
anonymous rest request it's just an HTTP

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,000
request

00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:49,320
and get attached so long as you're not

00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,680
also passing on this session yeah but I

00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:55,160
mean to what a multiple any more

00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,160
questions

00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:14,800
yes oh I forgot to mention this new

00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,800
relic is a beautiful tool if you are

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,100
doing performance optimization you

00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:24,550
should always you should always use it

00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:28,120
it has very good insight but i think we

00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:31,450
are nearing an exit excess profits are

00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:36,250
very good tool for not only performance

00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:38,560
optimizing but for solving for example

00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:41,290
nearly will tell you exactly on what

00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,550
layer is your applicants spending how

00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:45,210
much time how much time is going to

00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:48,400
database sample sizes PhD consuming and

00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:50,440
what is the slowest function and what is

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,530
the slowest square everything everything

00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,210
is you get a variety of information with

00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:58,330
beauty and nearly also has a triple

00:54:55,210 --> 00:55:00,400
agent which will give you a lot of

00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:03,280
information about our group in PHP agent

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,490
java and so that it has religion so your

00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,290
league is is one of the finest tool that

00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:11,620
i have come across and you should you

00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:13,090
should try using it if you are doing

00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,300
some serious business with your website

00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:18,370
I think you definitely need to have

00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:23,410
newly installed on your system thank you

00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:27,730
for this any more questions so one thing

00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:29,200
I want to add the big pipe that I told

00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:31,510
you that there are a couple of three

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,720
modules that page cache internal page

00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:38,160
page dynamic

00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:42,390
Big Bite big tumor for the for rendering

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:46,050
of the data so we don't have any do I

00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,880
associated with it why don't have why

00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:55,170
don't we have a GUI associating with

00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:57,630
deep any guesses yeah so if you if you

00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:59,700
will provide a new I for that then we

00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:02,010
have another dependency of conflict

00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:16,680
sandbox project that big bike all

00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:19,230

00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:23,580
but if you are interested in if you are

00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,920
if you're getting aid are you worried

00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:28,950

that stuff what we takin care there so

00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:58,920
this thing we can add in the code and we

00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:01,290
definitely don't recommend anyone to do

00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:05,000
to use it on the production but in the

00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:05,000
