God's economies in kind of here and I'm

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,010
hoping to have some great takeaways for

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,630
all of us as part of the new community

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,300

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:28,490
really but yeah like that is this

00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,520
working so I'm my clan I work for work

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,950
for Pfizer prices standardized on Drupal

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,690
about four years ago and she's pretty

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,080
much exactly four years ago to the day

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,910
now and over that time we drove up the

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,180
discussion of causal website salami on

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,710
google and when we only first started

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,020
the selected Drupal we had about

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,810
something was eight people in India work

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,910
with us in India and that's grown close

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,490
to 200 people now so we worked

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,920
extensively people with teams in India

00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,600
to to build a bill about Drupal sites

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,370
it's kind of weird the American stream

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,690
us a lift League game for the camp last

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,010
year which was which is also fantastic

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:10,040
as it is strange being at that paper and

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,250
i'm not paying frantically but I speak

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,900
for her today much to her chagrin I'm

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,160
all are awesome that effective director

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,280
of the purple

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,230
and I'm excited about this part of the

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,240
conversation at the association in

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,250
particular right now we're trying to

00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,980
think about what are the metrics that

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,990
are indicators of the health of the

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,000
people project at the contribution is at

00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:35,030
the heart attack and we're really trying

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,150
to understand the full broad spectrum of

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,920
contribution from code documentation to

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,220
camps and all the ways you can volunteer

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,960
and support the people of community so I

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,830
know we'll learn a lot from this that we

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:56,600
wound up Lionel husband and Joe on hi

00:03:51,830 --> 00:04:00,230
I'm Jen I've been working with triple

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,520
since 2005 which means it's a remarkably

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:06,350
long size of my life at this point and I

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,820
was a very early employee doctor I have

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,860
the privilege now to be in developer

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,710
relations at up here as the evangelist

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,480
and so on tom is actually defined in

00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:18,920
figure out ways to make your daily

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,390
developers better and I really really

00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,570
heavily involved in the community and

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,160
it's been incredible pleasure to watch

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,860
the Indian community grow and flourish

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,060
and become really really important

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,130
contributors I have also been quite

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,280
intensely involved at the intersection

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,870
between grupal and business in many many

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,200
ways and especially between government

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,030
starts opening a bunch of

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,700
government events in Las he was created

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,070
some of them and talk with people in

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,860
that space and I've got some very strong

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,710
opinions about how open supposed to be

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,260
Drupal chemical help us defend and

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,390
sustain a local economies and that's

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,310
what I think that's sort of mine the

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,300
main message I want to get out during

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:10,210
this today and it will ask questions

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:12,070
let's try to understand the audience so

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,800
that we can ask the right questions and

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,010
you can answer appropriately and forever

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,860
and so can you have a show of hands to

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,960
see how many of you are community

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,480
members you may have a good record you

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,130
may have participated in a un organized

00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,080
or whatever all right I was more than

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,180
half of that how I got near the Drupal

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,310
you know trying to check out for the

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:42,360
first time awesomest welcome in cinnamon

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,800
and and how many of you have been

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,110
contributed remember to find the car to

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,550
do is actually contributed at least one

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:56,950
patch at least one even organized or

00:05:51,550 --> 00:06:00,400
suffered an awesome thank you we have a

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,200
set of questions that will be asking and

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,150
talking about other any expectations

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,010
when you specific goal then any

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,080
challenges you rather go to four so that

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,870
you can direct our conversations towards

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,499
that we will refer to an hour audience

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:17,949
questions

00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:17,949
after the mystical other and with any

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,400
and I think a process of article always

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,250
says that here's a country of you know

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,330
how Lola's and there's not in the fall

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:46,220

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,990
very happy to take that is okay yeah

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,060

rate so yes nice not to be named let's

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,720
not get a very fundamental question kind

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:06,860
of broad and perhaps go to answer you as

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,590
well to the panel me what's your

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,500
impression of the indian ruben community

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,540
when compared to be global perspective

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,150
and completely global group at panera

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,750
out there how do you know where you see

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,370
us what do you actually feel about us

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,500
right you know we are part of the

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:31,730
meaning but how much my piece pizza shop

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,740
so um yeah I hadn't seen these questions

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,350
from she's just in Detroit 30 minutes so

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,030
i would say still is still early days

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,860
but it's growing extremely surely

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,470
rapidly and his massive massive amounts

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,820
of opportunity here so we've learned a

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,220
lot of but i'm hopefully to share about

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,160
our learnings of the last few years is

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,510
it a so the impression is that as a huge

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,250
amount of opportunity it was a huge

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,979
amount of talent here I've already

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,240
worked in Drupal so if the discussion is

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,790
going to be about how it impacted eyes

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,919
on that soon with that and then when the

00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,250
newsletter for my priceless opportunity

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,780
okay

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,230
until our for them we are open palace

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,230
language

00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:37,689
hmm

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:46,420
there's the other questions that far in

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,610
side seven so I I know a lot of the

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,980
communities around the globe pretty well

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,390
and I'm credibly excited to get to know

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,810
the Indian community and my first

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:59,050
impressions or there's more energy here

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,660
than almost anywhere else more governor

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,950
developers and incredible outreach to

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,420
the schools and universities and I was

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,950
talking with a guy ladies organize the

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,390
programs for students learning people

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,030
while they're studying and come come

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,370
straight out drawers all of this is

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,260
missing frankly in Europe and it's done

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,980
and it's exciting and it's energetic and

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm very very much like to come up here

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,680
and be part of this as often as I can

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,780
sir and i think that the AT&T movie has

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,120
a lot to teach the rest of us at this

00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:34,980
point to be perfectly honest well

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,980
through body saying

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:57,340
yeah so fabulous like you I think what

00:11:51,400 --> 00:12:00,250
I've seen we have given able to get into

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,610
schools colleges universities much

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:10,090
better than what immediate which means i

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:12,550
have commander countries and I think if

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,160
I mean not given you do not really

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:18,250
popular contributions over here and

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,640
that's something I'll touch upon Russian

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,180
cancer but other things right at the

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,440
word Jan said it's a young community and

00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,310
that this is an opportunity for get

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,770
molded into a community of of just

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,900
artistry this is great to see so many

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:43,000

funny because as my awesome thanks I so

you know what working on these questions

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,680
are asking some research and I think

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,530
pasa community maturity model by around

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,190
middle of a cube and they had few

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,190

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:34,399
must be on one of these parameters I

00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:37,100
said is a strategy music buzzer nearly

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:44,269
management political content and running

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:50,389
and mitosis and measurements really like

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:53,809
this question out there yeah let me get

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:56,389
ready so I think when you look at those

00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:58,970
areas again strategy and leadership and

00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:00,649
some other things that you said um we

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,220
look at those areas I see all those

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:07,970
things in the community here for short

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,610
you have ears all over the leadership

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,649
all the place people who are taking it

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,749
upon themselves to create camps to

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,610
mentor people the hosts Prince right

00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:20,299
you've got that covered and you can

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,730
cover all those visas and you know I'm

00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,399
definitely an outsider coming in here

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,339
but the one theme i think i've heard

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,970
over and over again is that there is a

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:33,980
challenge in that india is so vast

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,509
geographically and so there are lots of

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,379
communities where you're seeing these

00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:42,569
qualities emerge and but who is

00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:45,059
unified place for all of those things to

00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:47,149
come together and represent India with a

00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,799
capital i's it was the bangalore or

00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:51,509
hyderabad great and i mean that will be

00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,939
an interesting place to think about for

00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:55,499
india because just look like cheer

00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:58,399
numbers you guys are going to win the

00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:01,110
game eventually right if triples a game

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,089
without that right but it would be

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,369
really amazing to see what happened what

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:09,809
would happen if you could figure out how

00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:12,239
to overcome that yeah what it is you

00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:14,790
know that we the indian rupee community

00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:17,209
is still in its infancy but from the

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:22,739
communities in india up pretty mature

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:24,660
it's like 47 there is that glue as

00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:27,689
needed between all the different

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,549
communities cities in india and that has

00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:33,779
to be strengthened that has to be noted

00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:36,389
that is and i am not saying that when i

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,459
move the right direction we are it's

00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:42,269
still in very very early stages i mean

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:45,739
ii do not work and we get a view so that

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:45,739
can actually call it any new

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:54,060
as a function of direct and this might

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,920
be fortunate send we'd like to have you

00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:02,280
start first so dependent interrupting

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:05,700
video ecs and these robots hail of

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:11,700
consumption the contribution and upgrade

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:15,300
okay well I cannot say numbers so we

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:19,910
know that here is the second largest

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:22,790
traffic so stupid otherwise you say

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:27,390
cupola towaji has the second largest

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:30,930
pool of users come engine but we don't

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:33,870
have enough air not even in the top ten

00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:36,420
contributors to loop over 1100 modules

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,740
now this is Polly speaking of foundation

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,500
you know I think if you're talking about

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:46,500
non-core contributions events planes and

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:48,090
so I don't have any metrics to see that

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,800
way once also pleased but I think we

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,880
have tried equal to create amazing

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,400
events of Mumbai saw 6 50 plus at last

00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,330
my was our final request delhi are in

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:03,200
the best buy HP per second and only

00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,200
owned

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:10,330
yeah it's a dimension you know Kam's you

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:14,080
smear proposal 400p for easy I mean for

00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:15,520
example I was important uncle cam and we

00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,860
had only over a month of not getting

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,820
ahead of it and also the first camera is

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:24,310
still able to pull off one finds at this

00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:26,260
so people we have a pretty good over

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,300
there I think you know me are you able

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,550
to pull number of you attract people

00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,220
with lupus and like i said earlier

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,140
suppose always used great thing

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,550
contribution is a different story and

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,870
you may looking for that and i

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,600
personally seen a lot of excitement

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,570
building up in various organizations

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,520
over this prison porn and all right many

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,960
people come to me and asking them how

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,140
can I get in front because how can I

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,520
build this achievement organization so

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:58,180
you're going to be in vegetables

00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,550
ourselves our sites obviously still

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,860
early days that a couple of facts of

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:05,050
couples Enza is the happiness surgeries

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,610
mentioned it is II know that many many

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,250
makes eyes will know about being on

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,800
purpose to make thanks once go built an

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,900
idiot right and many large organizations

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,550
have been working with things with very

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,860
large things in India for a very long

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,830
time these companies many Me's office

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,750
moves

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,809
build pounds of your socks are so that

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,580
it will hear there's a big behavior

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,309
split shift needs to happen around

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,350
building these kind of sites these large

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,330
organizations of an outsourcing is kind

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:35,360
of a look indeed for a long time working

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,370
with people had to build in size the

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,720
eager visit of selfies are working in

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:44,450
its it's not building the behaviors that

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,070
will immediately lisa a camera

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,880
contribute code so for example these

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,529
these soldiers bill to protect both the

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,539
companies are writing a Shoney's

00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:56,059
proprietary rights Oaxaca visit any of

00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:58,490
these large large facilities and I

00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,899
perioperative it will be you'll be taken

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,159
off me require fuel Americans and I

00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:03,289
don't need to be taking this coat away

00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:05,360
and so precious these companies so

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,010
moving from that behavior turkey even I

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,809
write this code for the same client

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,730
you're going to upload it internet and

00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:12,620
give it away for free to people and even

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,200
if your troops community passage hugely

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,880
so this on that instead of the scale

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,100
this is a huge amount of what is going

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,740
on on here right now a huge amount of

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,620
talent what in the Drupal community but

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,360
I think one big ship needs to come from

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,950
these companies empowering the people

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,320
are working with each other to make the

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:33,950
ship right as you do that you might see

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,659
i see this i see and you're rocking up

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,669
the scale passion pretty quickly is the

00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:38,659
workhorses their their talents that

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,909
they're already working on this thing

00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,830
and they just there in many cases on

00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:45,370
aren't empowered to do it once to

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,659
empower to do and you talked about when

00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,460
when people can and want to do it how

00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,690
you encourage the ages actually get me

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,850
to do its part of the day the job

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,520
there's a huge plus openness to happen i

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,220
play too

00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:02,370
Kampai sister to really get potential

00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:07,590
based on a story anyone is one official

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:09,840
confirmation so Google has been growing

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,440
no I think that's understandable a

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,390
stroke and you know million websites

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,520
more than you personally think of a

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,950
degree more than one person tock tick

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,900
tock per hundred thousand websites like

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,360
you believe they have been growing

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,540
adoption across multiple working is in

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,640
industries and it suddenly has come

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,550
along we understand it's the same but we

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:37,740
still have a huge problem global uses

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:40,310
google calendar h and now aileas ID time

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,820
who you know it's who you know and

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:46,260
probably the biggest in the world grades

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,580
can really address that problem can be

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:54,270
really use this is up Terry what are you

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,460
as you know clears of businesses outside

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:59,760
and yielded up siding initiators of

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,370
sight see what you see from that site in

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,560
challenges that we need to overcome it

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,620
was so long ilias of improvements in

00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,780
order to leave it is opportunity how can

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,400
how do you think we can really move

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,880
forward towards becoming a thought

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,530
leader in a couple of months years or

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:23,930
you know whatever they get a tight

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:25,980
timeline for that perspective so o.o

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,750
leadership space which is going a little

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,790
bit different than the talent shortage

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,790
gonna thought leadership space energy

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,860
peters nothing a big inning communities

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,610
to do you have plenty about leadership

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,380
and

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,350
we need to happen is within a project

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,880
that skaters are really strong it's full

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,340
of wonderful people but there's a strong

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,580
Western bias great people who are just

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,170
really shocked but it was so much

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,299
contribution once we could see the

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,480
numbers there was such contribution from

00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,820
from India and so I think it's incumbent

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,290
upon us as the association of a

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,420
community as a whole to make sure that

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,420
we continue to bring ourselves here to

00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,270
understand what's happening here how

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:09,390
you're innovating here and that we're

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,309
making sure that we are we're making a

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,220
room at the table for the Indian

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:16,440
community to participate from you know

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,710
being able to highlight case studies on

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,870
group orgy to making sure that you've

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,750
got leadership roles in the projects

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:27,179
right so now that we can see the

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:30,330
contribution from this Community more

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,270
clearly I think we have work to do to

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:36,240
overcome of our own Western bias and

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,890
make sure that the name communities is

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,669
more included in all those in all those

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:45,419
ways because you're doing and I mean has

00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:49,010
so many amazing stories here and we just

00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,010
need to find ways to share them better

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:52,730
in this

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,130
it is kind of how along a similar line

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,799
on the stories of her since I've been

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,750
here just caring about the education but

00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,570
this happening and taking taking group

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,820
lynnze its many places and translating

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,919
training materials from any maples get

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,200
access to it is very difficult to then

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,580
then come here and say we've got some

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,169
answers for you so how you can push this

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,610
forward right I've got a huge amount of

00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,980
an extremely impressed by the things

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:24,710
that are already happening it's just

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:30,500
been an eye-opening experience for

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:32,330
numbersync this week you can see i think

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,260
is too in terms of bringing in people of

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:38,630
the community it's like we need to hear

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,640
what is helpful for you in terms of

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,049
getting started Bernie gets stuck in

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,350
getting started so we had a conversation

00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:47,299
yesterday right about issue queues and

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,460
how challenging they are fine an issue

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,640
and they said there's lots of written

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,919
words about that but it's not it's not

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,049
astronaut helpful for us and everyone

00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,669
with lots of competent English speakers

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,890
but the thing that really helps is if we

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:02,419
can see it too so can we get a video we

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,730
just walked through how the issue queues

00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:09,289
work and we could see it and hear it at

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,210
the same time and we get it right so it

00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:14,029
takes you there are some yep but they're

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,710
not super easy to find right so there's

00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,140
stuff I could wait to me to hear where

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,850
the stumbling blocks are so we need the

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,289
community to raise their hands and say

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,419
it would be better if you could have

00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:26,390
this right and so that we can bring that

00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:30,380
up it's just adding all of this we had a

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:37,390
discussion it is great this gifted

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:40,190
that's how we go over the next question

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,779
this is a this again about you know us

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,349
enlarging

00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:48,559
numbers game really so everything in

00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:50,119
india and asia in fact as much in terms

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,789
of numbers of sizes and so easily

00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:56,479
growing through the community now the

00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:59,330
question is for for such large and it is

00:24:56,479 --> 00:25:01,299
like these do you guys suggest more

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,979
people in this contribution for it i

00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:08,450
know they had been a conversation on

00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:12,169
drupal.org on this is this memorandum on

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:15,169
strike you know that Morgan bless

00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:16,369
contributions her head with white spell

00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:18,200
a bayonet because there are so many

00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:21,259
people you know a few hundred thousand

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,289
he would be one perhaps she came it was

00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:27,619
just consolidated contributions lesser

00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:30,049
people but more focused approach with

00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:33,109
solving complex strategies and their

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:37,399
problems what is this part Indian

00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:40,149
community from that private so other

00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:43,460
pedophiles got a very general level of

00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:47,149
contributions to be sustainable I feel

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:49,309
like he has many many people alright so

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:51,559
for example we were talking about the

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:54,739
digital talent shortage and also talking

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,629
about the number of people who are who

00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:58,219
are in India working on Drupal right so

00:25:56,629 --> 00:26:00,230
I think this to be sustaining those

00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:03,260
peoples and their lives and that age

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,020
in group allegedly project making take a

00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,850
look game a huge amount of contribution

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,130
as well so that's that's kind of the

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,919
answer the first option in terms of it

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,929
should be many many people so very very

00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,179
broad range of people contributing in

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,860
some way I think that that's sustainable

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,320
and I can I have a huge amount of value

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,480
I think at the same point to some

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,610
focused initiatives also learning trying

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,010
to push up to furnish report you do need

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,660
dedicated people crisis and mix I don't

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,919
think this is able to save ripples only

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,390
when we push forward by people who are

00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:34,970
completely dedicated nor they do is

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,190
contribute all day and of course that

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,660
that's important for many things but I

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,960
think that it's really be sustainable

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:45,370
and the broad base of Drupal Drupal

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,049
development of being drugs that in being

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,880
being trained here and welcome here I

00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,490
think it should it should already be be

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,900
able to contribute okay so something to

00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,480
be I'm going to repeat what you said but

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,600
there are two broad schools of thought

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,070
and two ways you can show have been

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,559
successful so far and I think that

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,480
they're absolutely applicable in India

00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,510
and probably everywhere else on people

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,610
like Ras color and tiffany paris very

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,280
very publicly support getting as many

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,530
people as possible in and doing what

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,630
they can and you know a few mentorship

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,280
and our community's ability to bring you

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:24,049
people and get them excited about making

00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:26,360
difference um it's like in any sales

00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:28,610
driven company you bring in 100 junior

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,110
sales people without looking too hard at

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,510
who they are and what they can do and

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,799
out of that new sub number will fall off

00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,860
and some number will succeed and

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:40,340
suddenly rock superstars and it's like

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,190
hard to tell going in who's gonna be the

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,340
superstar

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,840
so we need a really solid if we keep it

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,760
business or meeting us all the pipeline

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,200
of talent and if we keep it in more

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,360
community terms we need a really broad

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,550
base to build our community on than that

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,710
but it's essential and will fail without

00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:59,820
that our men will also produce a lot of

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:02,700
other categories of people there if you

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,760
look at linux code for example though or

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:09,630
some of the other open source projects

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,950
there are very hard problems very hard

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,570
problems that you need to wrap your head

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,470
around for a whole day or a whole week

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:19,410
or a whole year to fix um be it cash

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,300
tags and replace be it on some of the

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,310
other big markers that we had and I'm

00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,860
really really grateful that companies

00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,320
like aqua and chapter 3 and others has

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,780
stepped up to the plate and hire people

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:36,300
just to knuckle down and pink up the

00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:39,150
hard stuff and I I suspect that many

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,580
both I suspect that we need a growing

00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,970
community and an increasing

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,560
professionalism in at least core

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,520
development issue on module government

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:52,320
probably both um so and this is Richie I

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,480
mean India's starting on the way to

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,980
doing this very very well with as we

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,790
said before with people in schools and

00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,100
universities how the very large Drupal

00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,960
practices here whether it be Theseus

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:08,010
whether it be your team whether whoever

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:12,120
I would love to have some sort of

00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:15,570
auditing process or a self you know

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,940
reporting something where contribution

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,130
becomes more important in Jaden's a

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,920
development workflows I'm actually

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,550
working with it he was the guy working

00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,500
with the guy in Holland who faces for

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,890
his university studies about how a

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,870
contribution in

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,060
companies works and that's apartment is

00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,520
pretty fascinating and he experimented

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,960
and his drawl doing a couple of

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,820
different really simple steps in your

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,170
absolutely normal commit code tested to

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,400
include contributions and very very low

00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,200
friction way and we're going to be doing

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,790
some presentations about that as soon as

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,550
you've got the slides we do this year so

00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,680
that's kind of a third screen I guess is

00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:59,350
work contribution into your daily

00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:03,100
routine right um so that's what

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:05,530
interesting and in fact the Gateway

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,800
right away that ok but it really isn't

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,030
in yet what we're doing you know

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,740
organizing these cameras you know having

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,990
large number of people who use the

00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,850
purpose again they're pushing them in

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:19,570
creating them to even starting the first

00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,980
all right was contribution there's

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,140
nothing wrong about that let's give me

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,170
that the way they are and these would

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:31,150
automatically perhaps a logical to Bruce

00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:33,280
as a tablet or product again anyone

00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,870
anyone else but I'm actually glad I was

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,330
Justin says it's almost exactly the same

00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,280
happy for contributing to organizing

00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,870
events like this right so nice here at

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,730
the park last year's a huge amount of

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:46,240
energy weapons organizing all kinds of

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:49,180
marion and it was great to see Santa's

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,500
oceanographic etiquette who admitted to

00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,870
committing klosman that's because they

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,000
are paying job very same mobile happen

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,560
last year else before someone our tee

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,600
time from some other companies who

00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,510
through that area for absolute focus on

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,180
just organizing organizing the event

00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:05,860
supported by a complete teamer of other

00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,990
people contributing as volunteers to the

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,290
event right I don't know had an absolute

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,970
blast and I put the same

00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,650
will happen there is in you will find

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,870
the few as you as you select as you

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,580
suggested we really enjoyed it and then

00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,470
want to be able to push to either be the

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,120
person to organize the next couple be

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,220
more involved in on pricing next time as

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,340
these things are growing in a typical

00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:27,170
case a lot of a lot of a lot of work to

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,300
to get them to get them growing at the

00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,000
running so late exactly the same model

00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,130
therefore or these organizations or

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,530
organizing these events as well as as

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,480
well as the straight Pro competition so

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,490
if we touched upon that a lot this week

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,400
I've made us back as like a threatening

00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:49,070
to do to combat it behooves us to

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:51,620
remember that code and hatches or not

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:54,080
actually our tether app what we are

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:57,380
looking for smart people solving hard

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,900
problems together so we need people to

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:03,230
do the country um I think we also need

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,140
the communicators and we need organizers

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:11,840
and we need lawyers and contribution is

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:14,390
not only colored light so so please keep

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,250
that in mind it consider yourself a

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,750
community if you come from if you've

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,550
downloaded stuff if you use it there's a

00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,280
lot there's a lot more than just writing

00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:25,580
matches excellent that actually closed

00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,309
my second next question which is cold or

00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:33,919
normal court case

00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:35,779
poisonous and and either like balance so

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:42,710
thank you that for you know in a

00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:44,419
premonition yeah that's why you will be

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,919
on something else about you anyone

00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,169
that's all I think that a good person I

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,169
haven't passed out yet though you done

00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:59,149
for the community yet I mean you know

00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:00,289
yes okay yeah I think um so standpoint

00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:01,700
it out there a lot of ways to get

00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:03,350
engaged with your bikini that aren't

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,029
about code and they're really important

00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,070
for the community because the community

00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:11,179
is not a bunch of overriding robots

00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:14,119
turns out you guys are human and and you

00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:17,119
need human experiences right you need

00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,769
ways to learn unique ways to connect you

00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,330
need ways to walk away from people

00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:23,899
sometimes and get a little healthy

00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,549
balance storrington right like those are

00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:27,950
those are all things with the community

00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:29,480
needs and and so finding ways to

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,330
contribute along those areas really

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,850
important to keeping the community

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:38,090
healthy or I also think is really neat

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,220
is that we put a lot of emphasis more

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,100
emphasis on that here than any of the

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,110
project that I've talked to and I've

00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,320
experienced every open source community

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:51,320
for sure but we put a lot of emphasis on

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,419
that in Interpol when we talk about it

00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,580
or we fall apart is that we don't do a

00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:57,350
really good job of tracking that or

00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,360
showing that or recognizing that

00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,029
non-code contributions so there's a lot

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,499
more that we can see there that the

00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:07,159
association let the help the community

00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:10,639
stuff out and shown among our many many

00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:13,190
long list of priorities so we want to be

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,970
able to show that more but I I was just

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,129
want to point out that non code

00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,859
tribution is really important to you as

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,840
as humans but also as professionals

00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:23,820
because there is no coder that gets to

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,399
work all by themselves and a box and

00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:30,450
never interact with another human right

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,280
and when you come and help on a camp you

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:34,560
understand what it's like now to be on

00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,760
the marketing team right and so you have

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,520
to work with the marketing team in your

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,190
company you they don't seem like foreign

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,000
animals from another planet right okay

00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:47,010
get you now right um so it's a great way

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,859
to grow your skill set your own

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:52,080
professional skill set and be able to

00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:53,929
come in to any your next professional

00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,099
situation as a more well-rounded

00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:58,170
professional person so I really

00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,210
encourage people it can be very

00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:03,030
uncomfortable to try to step out of your

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,200
role as he goes take those on but I

00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:10,260
think it can be really rich and

00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:12,660
rewarding for you Evans what I have seen

00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,300
what I've experienced myself is that the

00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,730
right that it's just visit said if you

00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,460
wanna organize it and there are people

00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:23,790
who step up to help you and that have

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,520
happened in them we had great me and we

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,500
just had a month we had since it was the

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,750
first country had a lot of issues in the

00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,150
venue and everything but when once that

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:35,220
happened everything rolled along and of

00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,410
course we all can step out of our

00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,849
comfort zones now engine I said remember

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,790
the time one month again there was a

00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,260
month I had this yep but but yeah like

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,880
you said it's a very important

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,520
experience you know you're getting out

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,680
of shell you're learning more things and

00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,670
I mean the comment again from which camp

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,130
comments on the previous questions as

00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,339
well contribution part of things you

00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:02,790
know again not just poor contribution

00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:03,680
but normal conditions as well I find

00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,940
again

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,970
on my personal experience I find that

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:14,240
contributing helps you learn very very

00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:17,119
commonly idea over here is that ok

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,220
please teach me first ok how should I

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:24,280
least an able to believe and n-type

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:27,230
dopant sheep you yes is exact and that

00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,540
and that's something which I always try

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:32,180
to communicate we would be big an issue

00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:35,030
in whatever issue you think that appeals

00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,880
to you make it work on you don't get it

00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,859
you get hit on you and that sometimes

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:45,710
works and doesn't work at need to get

00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:49,130
better at understanding that it's

00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:51,890
notable that you learn the whole game

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,869
you would cooperate all the classes all

00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,339
the objects and then ok I'm game if they

00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:57,680
should do it doesn't work like that I

00:36:55,339 --> 00:37:00,440
learn to create type starting to

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,940
contribute and that's the message I want

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,900
to get across in all the screens you

00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,940
have underneath the tree or the transfer

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:10,190
alright so the Navy will find the right

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:18,140
balance of based on their own dynamics

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:21,250
oh you might so forget documentation is

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,720
a great way to contribute to absolutely

00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,640
it's not just you can the list goes on

00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,930
and on and on right so without without

00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,420
ripple project something that the

00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,740
challenges in being successful is not

00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,930
it's not the technology the technology

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,880
works great and then when it comes to

00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,410
these events and you see how fast the

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,210
technologies we move forward as great as

00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,650
well there are so many people who can do

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,569
a contributing to these events listed

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,250
disciplines around project management

00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:46,130
testing all these things are on and on

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,050
and on as these these skills where that

00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,820
parrot as a group

00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,710
most people contribute some peace as

00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,600
well writing sessions building these

00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,060
skills skills comes in triple comment

00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:59,020
and sharing that just keeps on Hell's

00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,880
Kitchen road you know that's the same

00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:20,950
list right I coulda said said you asked

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:23,440
other sessions yeah so have you ever

00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,970
contributed before no are you down to

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,650
this principle and are due to poor

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,180
little Google well if you come at this

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,080
time tomorrow I think they'll get you

you know so just learn how it all works

00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:38,770

started session okay okay you started as

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,910
advertised and I want to say that

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,100
they're called contributions fronts

00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:48,370
they're not code springs and that's a

00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,560
really important choice that chest over

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,810
their chest x TM and Kathy bays and the

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,140
other sprint mentors who we owe so much

00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:58,510
to in the community that they need

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,190
because it's not all about code but you

00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,690
can come and come to the game starts

00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,800
front I'll get you set up and then the

00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,800
next thing we do is they help you

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,800
understand what is that like panoply of

00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,350
options so if us is my thing how am I

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,810
find all the issues related to us that

00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:16,510
are in the triple issue queue that I can

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:19,560
go that I can go contribute to so yeah

00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,560
I'll help you do that tomorrow

00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm side sitting so I said the reason

00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:38,850
bility challenge is actually one of in

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,300
duple core it's one of our reach areas

00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:45,780
right now here we don't do the best job

00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,490
of like when even when we know the

00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,640
usability probably exists we don't do

00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:53,390
the best job of actually just pissing it

00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:56,070
so if if you're interested and in

00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:58,590
contributing into Cory music please

00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,120
don't take philosophy if you want the

00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,280
treaty to go together like to introduce

00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,950
you to vote on summers who's here who's

00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,870
on what our usability maintainers and

00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:09,600
also if you haven't met Angie she's a

00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:12,450
product manager for triple-a they can

00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,340
sort of like the like I would come to

00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,840
the first time scripture workshop will

00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,940
be interesting and valuable for you

00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,460
because you'll you'll learn like some of

00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,660
the tools that that developers use to

00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,040
contribute patches and you'll learn

00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,630
about how to use the issue primitive

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,650
things like that it's helpful when

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,930
you're interacting to have that

00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,150
conversation but just being throwing

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,920
alone like that will maybe be a sad

00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,170
experience for you so definitely talk

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,020
talk to go young on talk Angie and like

00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:40,140
how you're our contribution and a

00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:44,460
b-movie value agent excellent it doesn't

00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:47,550
leave this happen also hey you were also

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,490
a number one of the things that you can

00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:54,750
really help with tomorrow is leading and

00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:56,520
participating in translation sprints so

00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,880
if you know English as some other

00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,140
language not even

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,530
other language that you happen to know

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,710
then you can just use an interface

00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,570
interesting whenever in module and then

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,840
we did right men official progress of

00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:15,540
the country to be able to use a delusion

00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,880
so we are looking for people to lead

00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,880
students to their respective language

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,460
and to participate in appt tomorrow okay

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:28,410
accident so you know I might check this

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,820
whole thing okay look our and just I

00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:33,210
should just make me realize to you about

00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,680
contribution is that um it what your

00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,720
weakens are really saying there is like

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,510
it's really important to unlock it who's

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,970
who it's still really important as much

00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,260
of a meritocracy as Drupal is it's

00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,500
important to know if I'm interested in

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,910
u.s. going on right or angie gonna lose

00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,970
nine and these are the people I want to

00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:53,670
know right so if there's one thing that

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:57,120
you can do the help going at that

00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:59,910
thought leadership right like study up

00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,250
on Drupal and don't be afraid to reach

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,990
out to the people who are writing about

00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:07,680
the issues that you're interested in who

00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:10,770
are dressing the kinds of issues in the

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:15,270
queue that you might want to work on

00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:17,340
right every every issue has gone you

00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,780
know who's assigned to it and if you see

00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,130
them writing smart things and you're

00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,340
interested in that you think you can

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,320
learn that that there's a link there

00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,850
their name is living there tickled or

00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,410
profile and you have an ability to

00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,400
communicate it on the reach out and say

00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,170
hey you're saying something I'm really

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,920
interested and I want to learn can you

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:36,990
can you work with me and that is that's

00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,150
really important and don't be afraid to

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:42,120
do that because the community here is

00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:47,210
incredibly generous and kind and it's

00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:49,620
really important to find those people so

00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,119
there are so many peeps you just got you

00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,549
know

00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,619
that really answered your question but

00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:57,259
it still didn't know you have around

00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:58,849
five or six min en lot size counseling

00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:01,670
again each one of these camera starts

00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:02,569
good design the website standard so

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,640
that's where you can stop is

00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:10,640
contributing from US units UI design

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,990
perspective as well there you go in the

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,019
interest of time I think you only have

00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:18,289
got seven minutes left I know lastly our

00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:22,940
session and then there's a bar so many

00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:24,529
of them so I probably skip the next you

00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,150
know for questions and openly flouted

00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:29,950
because people are audiences questions

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:33,490
already we have already done that I'm so

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,490
some a piece yet

00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:58,600
so I mean in my nose now chuckling I man

00:43:54,040 --> 00:44:00,760
on puter so a lot of the things that

00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,040
I've always been doing is thinking of

00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,300
what's the difference how to make the

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:10,210
Indian community click and some defenses

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:14,860
that always come up to me is that there

00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:19,180
are a lot more hobbies in the West class

00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:21,790
holy dread more hobbies I don't like to

00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,790
have many organizations here we're ready

00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:28,240
to put in hobbies and let them continue

00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,860
to just code for trooper so these are

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,130
the things that bring like top

00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:37,360
contributions in the US like I know many

00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:40,150
people who are like programming and have

00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,030
a passion for programming continue to

00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:46,110
remain programmers in the West it

00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:48,580
especially where we are we tend to move

00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,110
you're a good program of your love life

00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:52,570
yours you can move into project

00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:55,360
management and union when your twitter

00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:58,000
friend cycle secondly there are very

00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,640
many organizations will be like ready to

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,070
put in a hobbyist and say hey don't work

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,550
for me just contribute for the community

00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:11,880
so and it just some big differences that

00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:14,140
you see between how we work casually

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,990
second i mean i have a list of points

00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:18,910
and i'm not going to steal this program

00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:22,660
just one who thought that I want to

00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:25,210
leave with this gathering is that the

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,190
part that always comes to me is should

00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:31,090
be worried that India is so quietly

00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:34,330
disparate and see how to unify them or

00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:36,880
should we just know guys our community

00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:41,530
interactions because I think sometimes

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,099
we get pulled into some thing which is

00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,150
very

00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:48,400
people for us to address rather focus on

00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:51,489
driving more global initiatives so

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,710
engines like America so you have to

00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:56,979
control the cons all over the you as an

00:45:53,710 --> 00:46:00,220
unsure you experience different kind of

00:45:56,979 --> 00:46:04,690
communities everywhere so this is the

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:07,839
question that i'd like to place I'd like

00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:10,989
to address the last point diversity is

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,650
incredibly important and the more

00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:15,970
different sorts of people you have

00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,119
addressing a problem the better your

00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:21,700
solution is going to be please do not

00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,799
search for a homogenized unified culture

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,599
to attack Drupal with please stay who

00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:30,220
you are and where you're from and speak

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:35,170
your language and really really in the

00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:37,989
in the West we have a great deal of

00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:40,989
difficulty in most open source projects

00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:43,299
getting enough diversity happen and one

00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:46,749
of the things that I've noticed here is

00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:51,039
a fabulous diversity of religions a lot

00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:53,499
of women here this weekend and I think

00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:57,430
please please don't try to fix that

00:46:53,499 --> 00:47:00,059
because none of that is about and the

00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:05,920
last thing has got you know me now

00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:10,529
culturally a lot of us are very shy many

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,529
of the best programmers may not have

00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:15,910
ready to share their inhibitions and go

00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:17,950
on to our ceiling for some things and

00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:21,279
just putting some with small

00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:24,759
observations and I'm sure I'm going to

00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:25,560
have opportunities to see how I can work

00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:29,610
with some

00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,880
to help you to use the i has to move

00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:36,900
indian contribution to different happen

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,810
ok so it was a presentation instead of

00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:43,290
regular google community and i was

00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:46,100
described as being shy and someone who

00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:50,010
is in this one by the way said that

00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:52,980
though you're not shy and this is

00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:56,250
copyright and if i look back i myself

00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:58,320
you know what really happened you can

00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,960
see it okay i probably not you tried

00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,530
everything you do it and let's move for

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:08,870
many programmers and it's only the first

00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:12,360
time that hurts really you just happened

00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:15,470
at means i get great useful that and

00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:18,960
it's just a problem of unity you know

00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:20,760
how do we get more attractive and again

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,980
it's climbing you know it's not a very

00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,350
hard problem right now i would say it is

00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,720
is more longing for loving when i

00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:29,490
started about contribution oh really and

00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:34,560
i see that happening all over the place

00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:37,890
and there's some sort of correlation in

00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:41,520
my life between successful open source

00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:43,800
people and communications what am I my

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,020
very first boss at a clear came out of

00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,490
the proprietary software world we

00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,160
figured that ripples can be something

00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:51,930
and he was running the first engineering

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,840
team when we were only one engineering

00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:57,750
in back pocket and she started to try

00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:00,540
yoga first products simple gardens and

00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:02,910
get seven orbs or the hosting platform

00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,370
came along and he kept on trying to do

00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,350
things and kept on sort of stalking and

00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:08,829
had to stop and actually figure out what

00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:11,229
the bike shed

00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:12,609
right at the fact that before we're

00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:14,890
going to do anything we're going to

00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:16,119
explore all the edge cases help you and

00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,890
all the reasons why this might not work

00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,109
and actually entire premise of the

00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:23,170
question you've asked let's talk about

00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:25,630
that first and eventually Chris Brooklyn

00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:28,959
said i would rather argue with a whole

00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:31,719
room of courtroom barristers group

00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:33,249
lawyers then with one open source

00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:36,430
engineer who doesn't want to do what I'm

00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:37,930
asking um open source people are great

00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,549
communicators and I've seen a lot of

00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,930
people come out of their shells I didn't

00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:43,809
know you had a shell but if you think

00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:45,279
everybody's well um but the way our

00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:47,499
community is set up there are enormous

00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:51,400
opportunities for communication also for

00:49:47,499 --> 00:49:53,289
shy people issue queues IRC on Morris is

00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,059
an incredible contribute to the project

00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:56,769
who's in there I don't even know how

00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:58,989
many years and I've never been to the

00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:01,059
person I'm not sure he's ever been sandy

00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:02,469
head but he's been incredibly important

00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:05,410
in the earlier phase of the project I'm

00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:07,690
not everyone likes to be on stage and

00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:10,089
talk about the good at school community

00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,700
is really really multifaceted world of

00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:15,190
communication that you can hook into

00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:19,209
their interestingly Larry Garfield's has

00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:21,099
also proposed PSR eight standard which I

00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:22,719
believe is a great group of contribution

00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:24,549
to the rest of the open-source growth

00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,269
and it's called the huggable interface

00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:29,559
and it's it's a way to control the

00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:32,469
physical interaction between 12 because

00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:34,059
we're also really hugging really really

00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:35,529
actually cultural eyes as I'm not been

00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:38,170
really important i think it's called the

00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:44,739
visa codifying that it had his first

00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:47,170
affected put it on you know i don't want

00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:49,809
to just put it on people to say well

00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:52,479
overcome your cultural you know in

00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:53,270
addition to your finger is so there's a

00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:55,700
place for us

00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:57,860
say you know people who are serving

00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,320
these girls in community say let's reach

00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,730
out proactively i think thats friends
