directory on your file system when you

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,740
import a file manually discarded

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,170
attitude so basically what you can do is

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,740
as contributed modules as possible to

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,540
write is you just pick whatever file was

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,850
uploaded by mistake you delete that file

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,830
and then you just drop the motor trans

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,980
issues and then you report heavy every

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,439
profile ensnare and in that case we just

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,689
restored to the state but if you also

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,929
manually change things or user interface

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,200
we do not write that out interviewer

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,329
files those changes so there is no

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,670
direct solution that is also possible to

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,559
avoid a module for that we don't have

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,110
that if you don't use that interface at

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,969
all and you accidentally for a video

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,219
file is much easier to recover from

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,050
because all of your files are in the

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,840
file system that you used to import some

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,770
time earlier they are sitting there and

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,770
you can employ them

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,710
yes in the future that system is

00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,020
possible to fix it okay I think I'm

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,140
running out of time anyway so I people

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,420
have questions please come over i will

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,060
be around i will be at the sprint so i

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,150
would love to work with you as you to

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,650
come over and interested in solving some

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,830
of the remaining problems that are very

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,010
interesting thanks for coming hope your

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,010
journey

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,540
totally better to go forward

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:10,280
everyone we made one in a minute for

00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:13,909
those who ride plate so riding our

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,689
machine and the session is good drupal a

00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:16,689
dramatic Hoshi

00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,520
practice a lot which is everything else

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,430
in the new blade English the rest of the

00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:31,030
session is going to be in English so I

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,480
am appointing and I have kind of a

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:37,110
tendency to to test the system of

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,290
conferences this one is formidable crime

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:44,530
this one is from another book on this

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:51,130
one is from program booklets and this

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:53,980
one has gone air so so the problem that

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,739
week's mean has some events which is

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,930
kind of ironic for Camtasia is that full

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,080
of louisville support is sometimes an

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,380
afterthought and here and I'm stretching

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:12,190
that problem sorry most simple page but

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:14,620
it was always so we decided in Tripoli

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,570
to kind of look at this st if we can

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,109
make the system understand everything

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,540
may be multilingual including wings and

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:25,690
try to solve that in a systematic way

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,550
and this talk is about a little point

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,010
more normal system only and we'll have

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,290
plenty to talk about it would probably

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,090
go too fast for some of you but there is

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,690
a lot of other things in Germany to be

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,479
proud about so there's web services that

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,610
are also equal to some degree as well as

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,689
use that or hall table as well there's

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,449
often experience

00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:49,549
configuration system there's mobile

00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,459
improvements a whole lot of things but

00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:54,259
this is just about most anymore you

00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,149
could do this however there are a lot of

00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:58,719
the other subsystems that have been

00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:01,639
improved actually added a lot of

00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:03,679
additional power to what we do in the

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,559
most lingo system so you will see for

00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:09,619
example with use and abuse and what

00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:13,159
we've already intersect gives you very

00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:15,049
powerful tools the other thing that I'm

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,769
going to leave with another person doing

00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:20,869
decision but obviously there's a lot

00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,669
more people work on this so there is a

00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:25,069
Drupal a multilingual initiative and

00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:27,469
this is a list of people who work on the

00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:29,029
new beginnings contributing more the

00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:31,879
Builder names contributed more recently

00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:37,699
and it's not in fact the whole list that

00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:42,019
would be the holder so it's a whole lot

00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:44,989
of people working on this so I think we

00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:47,119
put in a lot of effort and across a

00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:49,399
thousand three hundred of us we also had

00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:52,009
a lot of fun building this up for you so

00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,139
we went to all kinds of events and sat

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,610
down and worked with each other and

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,979
mentor each other on different issues

00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,979
and just figured out how to make things

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,439
happen we also just said come to load it

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:07,069
worked pretty hard I also had a lot of

00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,559
fun and celebrated a lot when we figure

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:12,349
out our solutions we also worked at a

00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:15,619
lot of issues so if you try to counter

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:18,110
the issues that we tagged with the mi-28

00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:20,569
multilingual ownership there's over two

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:24,499
thousand seven hundred of them we did

00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,239
not resolve all the issues there's gotta

00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:27,790
be a triple a point one difference to be

00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:30,250
43 triple 9

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,580
hopefully sometime so there's a food

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,230
group but you'll see that we did a whole

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,680
lot of things and a question is right

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,840
why did all these people come together

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:47,950
and do all these crazy improvements

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:50,770
tough issues the reason is we have had a

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,410
bad experience with activity centers we

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,990
had our struggles we seeing that people

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,600
use Drupal in all kinds of environments

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:02,200
like for example verlaine uses it on

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,660
their city marketing sandy Berlin also

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,420
Canada uses it on keep exploring their

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,790
Canada marketing side magic together in

00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:14,710
uses it if you've been rolling ever

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:16,930
before the army makers of fun games

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,900
there's the banking sector use it this

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:29,140
time from Lithuania the public transport

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:31,270
sector uses it and Montreal beauty

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,270
sector uses it is a love offering will

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,690
Drupal sites interests use it for the

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,490
business size in this case which means

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,310
the world health organization uses

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,050
triple buffering wall unesco use the

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,620
triple more thing if you want to

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,710
register a domain india we would go by

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,330
mostly go to the size if you want to

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,750
connect with the government in the other

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,759
couple

00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:00,479
over the side if you are interested in

00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,180
some TV on Sonic's I TV that's also

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,830
mostly go to the side so it's kind of

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,419
our not to bump into multilingual

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,620
process so a lot of people already do

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:14,539
this any anybody in the room who had

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:19,080
ain't doing this struggling with issues

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:22,319
anybody okay love you yes so it is

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,449
possible but we wanted to make it a lot

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
simpler and these are organizations they

00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,889
only have a lot of resources and need to

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,550
work their stuff but what I'm really

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:35,940
proud of is a small sites but this one

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:46,140
comes tempered they have a site in

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:49,020
English Portuguese and okay hi so they

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,180
have a site in three languages and just

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:55,290
for a small program for kids to make

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,470
them learn technology so this is the

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,450
site that does not have resources to

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,790
developers and solve all their problems

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,680
so the media system where they can just

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:10,110
fire off a multilingual site can be

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,550
happy with that I'm in no time the

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,790
problem is we are not really delivering

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,399
that with super 7 we have to pack or

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,480
annual able to a cow module is great you

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,440
can have

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,560
on the site a nice you can translate

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,630
interface but then it's all men you only

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,459
need to enter everything I newly a few

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,350
download transitions from the community

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,329
to manually download them from the

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,730
localizer to blow our imports into the

00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:38,610
site of them on the sideline you up a

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,959
fuse Madeline pedalpaddle translations

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,639
are at eight if you need to manually go

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,790
out again download again import again

00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,949
it's very painful so you would obviously

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,680
install localization of the audio which

00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:51,990
automates alter few examples of those

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,630
translations when you have money when

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,699
you operate models very nice that's it

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,699
in a phase transition you still cannot

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:01,350
do any most legal content so you enable

00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,870
to cut the transition model that's nice

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,339
so now you can have multiple copies of

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,010
the same kinds of peace on the site

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:12,380
different languages have relations

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:17,490
between them now you put them in my news

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,649
that is not translatable no sorry so you

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,500
is all the IDT that module that's nice

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:23,880
enables you to try to save my news it

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,579
also enables you to translate a few

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,010
other things like field labels and talk

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:30,540
I always and stuff like that but now

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,720
you're scratching your head you want to

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,760
translate this the email that elf users

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,190
emails are being sent out there instead

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,120
of at all none of these models allow you

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,180
to translate the emails that are

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,500
users so now you enable the variable

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,529
modules this is a whole set of modules

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,500
it's a variable module the variable I

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,210
think there's connecting modules between

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,540
the two so it actually enables you to

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,360
translate those on email text ok that's

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,600
fine now you have an ecommerce shopping

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:06,430
is that you want to sell stuff anything

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:09,220
would enable you to translate that so

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,600
you grab the equity translation model ok

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,339
i'm kennie translation module that

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,920
allows you to translate driver entity

00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,260
ones they also allows you to translate

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,850
cursed arbiter is but you are a miss

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,830
call the idea that matter which does

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,870
allow you to protect our winters as well

00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,120
so you have two ways to translate text

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,250
on meters accountant transition model

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,279
you also have which used before to

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,750
translate notes so now you have two ways

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,839
to transmit notes and the interposition

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,480
and content transitions kindness so even

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,670
trying to figure out at this point tool

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,370
to use for what I a design firm

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:46,400
where I am kind of interested this

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:53,240
happen so I salute you for figuring it

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:55,040
out in Drupal 7 good job so quickly we

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,470
wanted to make this simple we want to

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,360
clip one solution for everything and so

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,520
that that solution actually works never

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,950
other model you add one at ways you have

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,980
rules if you have ecommerce if you have

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:10,970
whatever like workbench for something

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,670
else so we added a system for managing

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:17,090
languages those about your languages and

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:20,120
this is it decides how will just fit etc

00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,800
and less of a stores then we have a

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,350
system for translating the interface of

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,080
Drupal and that works across everything

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,910
on the interface you can translate these

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,940
with that we can translate content I

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,550
don't think there are built into your

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:38,570
code we had a Content transaction system

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,920
on Viper content panthans meeting all

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,950
kinds of things well define that later

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,410
on and we have finally the solution for

00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,870
transcend involve configuration please

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,530
four pieces basically cover everything

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,030
in rapport and they are extensible and

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,310
they allow you to translate every

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,800
configuration entropy enthalpy whooping

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,550
every code is shipped with modules and

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,880
agreed configurations so let's go

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:08,330
through decency plus any court so let's

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,070
start with language so that which is a

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,170
separate module language of reports

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,480
called the language module we wanted to

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,250
really highlight this feature out of the

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,190
ghetto from

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,550
arts when you install Drupal the first

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:23,590
screen you see is a language selector so

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,640
you go there it already selects you the

00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,070
language based on your browser

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,990
preference American seniority but you

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,820
can pick whatever else from 100 or so

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,550
languages we have in this case I'm just

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,620
going to be a repeat point up and you

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,600
can say I can view and download the

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,030
transmissions right away on the

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,640
agreement or the next queens gotta be

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:45,520
Arabic it's a part that it's not right

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,950
to left every right to that suit so you

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,450
pick your install profile you give it

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,490
your database credential dispensable

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,940
Arabic except where is that translate it

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,390
was not a fault so you get that an hour

00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:01,320
from the others I feel as well and and

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:04,750
working with installation so basically

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,670
the first thing you choose honorable is

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,470
what your languages I'm that you don't

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,870
need to know anything about English it's

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,890
all going to be in your memory it's all

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,080
working however in woods so that's the

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,790
first thing that one language the new

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,280
money system second thing is like an

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,560
assignment so the problem with

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,830
translating up is we can only translate

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,110
stuff if we know what language is in

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,180
otherwise the make assumptions may or

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,370
may not be true purpose that makes a lot

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,660
of assumptions about language and it

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,839
makes a lot of mistakes based on those

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,570
assumptions so the problem in triple

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,640
seven is it only supports saying what

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,630
language of notice and what manager user

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,570
is in and one language of illness is it

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:51,400
if you set up a few in Drupal 7 we have

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,180
no idea if you said that view having a

00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,100
miracle

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,170
you are in Spanish or whatever other

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,330
language we don't know we need to assume

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:02,230
that probably created that you inside

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,899
default language maybe we don't know

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,320
what your what your user emails are set

00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:11,350
up what language do we have money so as

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,140
kind of a problem so in eight we decided

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,370
to extend this basically infinitely so

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,160
it's not like we know the language

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,260
profit economy term you know that text

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,360
time with your nose in distance we know

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,910
the language of views when you create a

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,709
view you can't created you in any and

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,810
then if youíve you that's only available

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,360
in the english part of the site i trade

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,540
that you in english and then later on if

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,149
you decide to like transept english 12

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,130
indian hindi 13 english is only fight

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,260
it's gonna work so we know the limit of

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,480
use we know the language of your site

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,870
information like nova language your site

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,230
name is your emails etc all of them and

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:53,589
that's basically infinitely expensive so

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,209
we can go on and a sign language do

00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,310
whatever we know that I'm image of your

00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:59,680
menus we don't let me have your menu

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,839
items we know the language of the blocks

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,940
that just play your menus with your menu

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:14,800
items and we know and then we need to

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:18,970
figure out how we chose to use so we

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:23,160
have this hazard language screen for and

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,160
the language assignments and by people

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,880
so we have a panther memory screen for

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,070
sine what leverage to use for our

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,980
conference because now we know to

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,200
unleash where everything but it could be

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,510
very tedious to setup language all the

00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,160
time when you create a view we kinda

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,140
hide that language setting behind this

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,270
effort screen because we make an

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,310
assumption you can confuse how everybody

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,410
wants when you create a forum post on a

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,910
site on a random site it would be kinda

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,460
jarring to see your language selector

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,920
there it's very confusing so we decided

00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,560
to to give you an option to configure

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,140
the language be false or accountants and

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,660
the way we do that is by default we

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,140
create all contents in the side default

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,970
language and you can set up the

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,100
divergence from that so you can say you

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,110
want to create content in a different

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,940
language and custom locks in different

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,010
languages as well and then you can stay

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,930
okay there are articles and basic pages

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,610
in forum topic so maybe I want to create

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,350
forum pockets in English all the time I

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,390
don't want to know any more firm and

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,490
i'll show the language selector on firm

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,080
talking but for articles i want to

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,510
default them to english but i want to

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,670
show my respect from them and forgetting

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,280
pages is fine too because its timing is

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:41,070
controlled by a selector and then for

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,770
basic box i wanna in English again and

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,170
showing so basically it's very flexible

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,410
in terms of how you want to serve

00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:52,140
interactions for language assignment for

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,570
these things so you can say they always

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,490
decide vehicle language which is deals

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,080
on a checked or you can diverge from

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,450
that and say what

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,279
language dynamically whatever right

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,570
great that type of protocol used to say

00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,490
I want to fix that so if you have a

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,630
single line before is going to do

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:16,140
dessert so that's about setting up I

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,000
which defaults for contents and that

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,190
that I'm not sure you've noticed but it

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,529
has dynamic defaults like the current

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,570
pages selected language or the users

00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,909
preferred language besides default

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,070
language so like if you take reviews on

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:30,720
products the user would probably

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,370
subjective review in the language of the

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,470
page because they always ended us on the

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,000
page so you can be called the review to

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,529
the language of the page and you're not

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,019
sure the language selector to reviewers

00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:42,779
that makes you can get a multilingual

00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:45,029
reviews I depending on the page it can

00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,279
be knowledge but the user is not bother

00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:50,429
this is my second language at all so you

00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,639
know the data but the user is not bother

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:58,320
with the interaction then we've got

00:18:53,639 --> 00:19:00,090
language two blocks as well so once you

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,399
have information on your content you

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,679
have inversion which reviews etc you

00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:07,080
probably also want to have language for

00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,639
your age building elements a Drupal

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,260
light comes with blocks where that still

00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:14,010
they don't have a fancy resolution yet

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,260
so we put language visibility in the

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,669
core four blocks and that means that

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,320
when you have language module enable

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:21,720
there's this language selector on blocks

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,470
and it allows you to select which

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,600
languages will this block show up on if

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,870
you don't check anything you go show up

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,730
on old news so it's very easy to set up

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,669
pages for different images height

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,980
certain things this can be used to set

00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,590
up multilingual menus for example within

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,840
time

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,539
I use every menu is displayed with a

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,890
block so you can say i want the

00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:46,779
different kind you're my Hindi site from

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,580
a healer site so you can set up a menu

00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:51,039
in agreement and in English and then

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,779
show them in their block and then sure

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,990
they're aside their language visibility

00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:59,070
based on which and you want to see on

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,510
which page so that's also available with

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,400
blocks and now we have all those

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,210
languages how do we decide what's

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,850
actually used on the page is based on

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,010
our language selection criteria and this

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,640
was available in Drupal 8 as have it as

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,559
well but we can prove this a whole not

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,529
so one of the things is super 7 you

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,110
enable locale module and add a few

00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,880
languages and loving happens because it

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,549
is no defaults as a sensible defaults

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,480
for lemon selection in Tripoli we have

00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:34,539
this URL language selection feature

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,090
enabled by default then when you go in

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,250
and configure that the prefix and the

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,710
main configuration is right in there on

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,600
one page so it can review all the

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,860
prefixes and domains foreign language so

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,010
you don't need to go to every language

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,659
and figure out what set up and how so

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,059
it's very easy to set up here with best

00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,380
shot prefixes and domains the special

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,100
selection is pretty much the same as

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:59,080
before the user regard configuration is

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,700
designed for user preferences the

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,440
browser set is very different because

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,179
that we allow you to have external

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,370
language crispy internal language codes

00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,870
so Drupal understand that not all the

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,200
language codes are the same across the

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,570
globe so like Chinese

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,520
I wish kazoos that we mapped to our

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:18,510
internal language code and you can add

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,220
whatever mapping you want so that when

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,710
browser language preferences come in we

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,590
come after two internal languages then

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,270
we have administration page user

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,860
preferences so you can browse the

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,720
administration experience in the prep

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,940
and you preferred language and we have a

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,070
selected language callback which you can

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,800
configure either to the site default for

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,660
specific knowledge this solves one of

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,510
the biggest problems in Romani because

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,070
seven because in Drupal 7 people change

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,870
the default language of the site and

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,790
Lucas ever makes a lot of assumptions

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,770
about the default language as I've said

00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,330
before everything you created assumes to

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,970
be in the default page so when you

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,740
change that it just pray something so

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,540
here this is totally separate from

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,870
society phone I need you can configure

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,120
it to hover however you want and um and

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,890
just is going to use that if you will

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,600
decide you whatever language you wanted

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,720
when you have it over to the client you

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,220
just change the language fall back they

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,730
can use their favorite language as a

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,610
default now we put in name

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,740
transliteration so if you act in a

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,200
Drupal generation machine but that was

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,660
usually difficult with all kinds of

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,520
foreign languages so in this case the

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,860
string that is all that is

00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,230
characters it turns out the video

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:40,320
available English string and that

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:42,750
happens to work with so we have a

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,580
library building for to do translation

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,740
for machines we don't have

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,540
transliteration for five loads for

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,720
balance is all going to be housed in

00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,060
work at this point I would love if you

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,000
would come on Sunday and help us build

00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,370
out those things or 8.1 8.2 because

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,080
that's a very often often requested

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,920
feature that we haven't be able to get

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:08,010
away we have this result them one thing

00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:10,230
that at least the New York is very

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:14,070
popular is English can be deleted from

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:16,470
beside so in through 27 English is

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,840
always there and you can disable it or

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,910
than I 89 tends to show disabled

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,280
languages and places is going to be very

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,380
confusing to see English or the place

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,520
where you know needs you have English so

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,830
in true polite you can just delete

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,810
English and the way it works for all the

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,030
things that are in English like the text

00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,630
in the source code is obviously going to

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:39,030
work because it's hard coded English so

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,260
we to do that but the English itself is

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,850
not going to be on the system is I'm

00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,940
going to be show up in your selector is

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:50,130
only one or the user as my convenient if

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:52,620
you actually wh so in summary you can

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,470
live in English there's a very flexible

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,840
system for selecting language it's it

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:01,680
has sensible defaults no URL selections

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,090
it will not be faulted nothing's etc we

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,380
have blocked disability foreign language

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,860
you can hide and show the Oxford

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,880
language you can place a block multiple

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,890
times of the page

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,780
and you can talk about them that allows

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,870
you to play something at different

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,410
places for different coverages so if you

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:22,110
have a special special inside you're

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:24,750
running for a certain region you can put

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,610
that up for that specific region then

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,320
you can hide it for everything else or

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,300
you can put it up down on the page for

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,970
some other region or some other language

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,000
it's very easy to show the same thing

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,040
multiple places based on the nature

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,350
sorry cool we have flexible

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,650
configuration for language default on

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:46,110
content we know language up a lot of

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:50,130
things that it's a person installer so

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:53,250
just liking all these new things oh so

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:56,010
this was one fourth of the improvements

00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:59,640
into place somebody asked if it's going

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:02,580
to be easier angel blade I hope so next

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,350
one in a phase transition so as I said

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,200
the problem with having a phase

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:10,100
transition is it's my this menu a lot of

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,290
manual work blood work drupal 8

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,060
everything is automated so endings how

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,730
you think the language with owls right

00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,440
before the next screen appears if you

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,300
later and languages if that was

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,580
transmissions right awake at the points

00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,220
if you install new modules we found

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,350
those translations in the installation

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,750
progress marvelously translations it

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,360
applies it on the site so by the kind is

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,210
it says none is already translated and

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,430
downloaded and if the community updates

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,230
your translation of opposite of glory it

00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,690
now is the updated translations as well

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,030
all tonight now you may be all freaked

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,620
out because you go to the employee site

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,650
and then it's kind of automatically

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,260
comes with things in the background good

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,900
however what we did is we centralize

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:58,560
this download stuff into one new by

00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,300
three and what you can do is you can use

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,250
this ultimately dowler system in your

00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,050
staging or development environment where

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,840
this just happens then you do the

00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:09,549
quality assurance and then you push this

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,700
directory to the live site and it is

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:14,499
not is there and as are the deployment

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,749
process you can just import those files

00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:19,119
at the different process than you are

00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:21,340
done with your updates to the website so

00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,169
it's fairly easy to use this on the

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,289
station side of course if you don't have

00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:29,739
a complicated saving the environment

00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:33,970
economy outside like on my blog I easily

00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:36,039
my site it's not miss Chicago so I

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,110
thought Freddie anybody that wants to

00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,169
like take care of what's on what words

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,609
are used and it's very easy to do the

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:44,559
other thing where you want to take care

00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,600
of what words are used is you make

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,519
modifications to those translations

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,080
because let's admit what everybody's

00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,230
happy with the translations that the

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,179
community does so we did in 8th is you

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,489
can customize those translations on the

00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:59,859
site and we know which strings you

00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:02,379
customized so we try every string that

00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:04,509
you customize and by default we do not

00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:06,489
overwrite those customizations from the

00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:08,499
community so even if the community

00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:11,619
updates transitions to those strings we

00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:14,320
keep your customizations on the site you

00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:16,659
can obviously set it up to override it

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,809
from the community of my people it makes

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,820
sense and because all the strings are

00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:23,799
marked you can export your customized

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,989
strings and take the same customizations

00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:27,519
to a neck to the next client you know

00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:30,020
take those customizations to the next

00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,940
client so you can be used your same time

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,650
presentations or you can use these

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,170
transition files across different

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:40,310
markets that you serve or whatever you

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:42,880
want so it's very easy to to to

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,800
customize and use those customizations

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,700
across different systems we made it very

00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:51,290
easy to catch up on translations so you

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,180
who knows this user interface

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:57,320
translation search interface from Drupal

00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:00,020
7 not a lot of you so probably the

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,790
reason for that is this it possibly keep

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,680
it sensible 7 because you search for

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,660
something and then you get a table with

00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,790
the sum of your languages cause that out

00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,160
we're transitions that available then

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,380
you click in and you have 20 languages

00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,420
on the site and now you have 20 input

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,540
wheels for one string to translate

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,950
monstrance is ready languages at once if

00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,780
you've probably done the whole tiny

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,090
languages of the size of what you would

00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,760
likely do is you would want to search

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:28,520
and then get results the translate them

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,950
right away right so that's what we do is

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,260
replace so we have a table it supports

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,390
singular plural pairs which obviously

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,580
support florals in any numbers this

00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,220
example is Hungarian the same number

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,650
Gloria listen listen it works good

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,620
whatever number of florals coverage and

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,420
remarks stuff that you changed with the

00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,230
special color so if you come back from

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:53,600
shy secret change and it saves them as

00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,790
customized transitions so if i search

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,509
for only translated strings customized

00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,359
and

00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:01,249
see that those things I customized web

00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,049
site these are not protected from

00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:05,389
community updates they're not going to

00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:08,329
be overwritten by anything else it's

00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:11,209
very easy to do on the side another

00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,979
thing that people be the ones and we use

00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:16,249
the string / rise module for that is

00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:19,129
change the English exponent so let's

00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:21,769
make plugins a sign in it's not possible

00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:25,070
in eight out of us all the seven some

00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,659
people take take the string over as much

00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,109
of other people start English custom

00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:32,749
language both have their own problems so

00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:37,459
what does it relate is translate to

00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:39,319
English high five so my default English

00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:42,859
is not applicable as the translation

00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:45,799
language about you can go ahead in

00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:47,119
English it's a very easy edit form and

00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,239
as your box at the bottom that says

00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,909
enable transmission to English now

00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:56,409
english is the transition target and i

00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:59,299
can say okay i want to search for login

00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:04,669
in english and i want to change that

00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:07,789
designing and say that last a touch and

00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:10,339
then from that one my login button of

00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:14,179
the anonymous content will say science

00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:19,339
and ago this content will say sign it on

00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:21,199
the body so very easy to touch up an

00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:24,049
interface text no need to serve any

00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:26,209
other modules no need to have a special

00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:29,049
english language this very useful be

00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:32,179
perfectly set up a special industry

00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:34,580
english and some content diseases I mean

00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:38,179
some companies in the other one is a

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:40,309
mess so yeah so that's benefits

00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,679
transition you can translate to English

00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:44,710
as it change the position of his ex we

00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,869
have a whole new interface for insight

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,970
transition of mortgages we track your

00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:53,200
customized register can diverge from the

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:55,450
community if you want however we also

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,190
collect transmissions from the community

00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,229
automatically downloaded and update them

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:03,169
even smart contributed modules and

00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:05,419
themes to competitively and we put that

00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:07,009
into a central directory that you can

00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:09,289
use in your deployment system and

00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:11,389
disable this feature on the website and

00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,309
it's a totally separate module so if you

00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:15,649
donate a debate transition you just want

00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:17,960
to track languages on files you don't

00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:20,049
need to do this puzzle to just use the

00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,320
market model be happy with that one

00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:28,159
anybody found useful things in there

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:31,820
yeah that's half of what we change the

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,210
second heart is filled right so our next

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:37,399
one up is content transition so as I

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,720
said the problem in Drupal supplement

00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,849
comes in translation is we have this

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,149
module in horror of content translation

00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:46,159
it only allows you to translate nodes it

00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:48,229
also makes copies of nodes that are

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,389
separate comments we also have this very

00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:52,700
facility transition model in concern

00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:56,179
that Eliza's dress in all kinds of

00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,009
entities but it does not allow you to

00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,599
translate the titles of some of the

00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:02,749
entities you need to have the title

00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,279
module as well and the few of them are

00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:06,950
not directly compatible so you're a

00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,320
 is one or the other it's hard to

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:11,269
migrate from one to the other and it's

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,729
even harder to choose between them and

00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:15,539
the worst part is contributed modules

00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:18,419
may or may not be compatible

00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,639
want any other ideas babies 10 points

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,669
somebody money to have the system all

00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:26,190
right all content enemies are supported

00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:28,999
and all the contributed modules work

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,999
with that

00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,460
that's a huge benefit of having this

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,380
important because we can have a base

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,590
solution for everyone's questions what

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,410
is it I'm competitive is I used to set

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:48,630
up a broad sense so Drupal 8 has

00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:51,240
entities which means basically a things

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,520
that have instances of them have

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,230
multiples of them and there are two

00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,900
types of things that can have multiple

00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:00,480
items there are confident ease which

00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:04,080
usually take fields not all of them

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,540
thank you so for example notes user

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,090
comments that time attorneys contact

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:12,630
messages menu items etc are kinds of

00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:14,940
entities so we have language support for

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,740
them has shown before we can configure

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,330
that which defaults for them and using

00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,630
their face of how language is a fight

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:24,600
but you can also translate all of them

00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:27,900
into different languages and that's very

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:31,920
powerful so we based this on the MPD

00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:34,260
transmission model from Hull 27 and you

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,240
can figure it on the same screen when

00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,450
you used to configure language defaults

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,150
or content and now is the time to pay

00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,280
special attention so it's the same

00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,170
screen example Catholic language and

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,540
translation since I enabled transition

00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,640
still has a summary of the same content

00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,130
types but now there's a dress in a

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,080
double check box for every content types

00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,480
so I want articles just a table how I

00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,790
have all the fields or particles one by

00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,290
one and I can decide if the title is

00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,810
transmittable while the author is

00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:06,060
tractor language or publishing space is

00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,740
different or language and for images I

00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,660
can even say I want to have the same

00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,090
file but I want to have a difference alt

00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:14,940
text in title sense and I can decide if

00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:18,090
I 10 centimeters left brain or not same

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,550
verb + same four pages single carbon

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:23,780
tacos so basically all the fields that

00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:27,600
are supported on an entity type are

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:29,760
exposed here and you can say which bills

00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,800
you want to translate so you can say I

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,520
want to track the author for a language

00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,600
I want to publish things / language so i

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,600
may be publishing

00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:44,200
or you can track you can have the same

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,599
file but different text like if you're

00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,609
selling products you probably have the

00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,379
same product photo on different

00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:52,419
languages but you want to have different

00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,030
acts on them for all texts and penalties

00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:57,490
but if you have illustrations for a book

00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,920
they probably have different i'm jealous

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:03,369
trations distance us from them on image

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,700
as well so you can make your own choices

00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:08,619
here bae out for every field so this is

00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,710
very similar to how I te transition

00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:13,660
works in seven it's feel great but if

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,790
you really like the content transition

00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,040
model in court and seven you just check

00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,079
all the checkboxes every single checkbox

00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,819
and that is practically the same thing

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,010
because now you have a copy of that we

00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,530
filled in every language and now we have

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,200
a copy of the content in a balloon so

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:32,020
it's easy to reproduce the both

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,200
approaches from seven and it's possible

00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:37,210
to introduce anything in between is

00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,980
matters on what you choose and you don't

00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,510
need to do any vibrations because it

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,160
just happens in the configuration system

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,530
you know like my gracious with really

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,089
crooked operations I think that's kind

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,040
of powerful deliveries of these the

00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:54,490
translation interface for content is

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,730
really boring same thing is a translate

00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:00,160
pad that was in seven you go to

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,470
translate tab it has a list of languages

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,750
that are available you pick a language

00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:07,780
you want to add that translation two

00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,849
columns and those form in this case for

00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,479
note and then you can just enter their

00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:15,979
trans

00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:20,660
happy with the results so that's that's

00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:27,170
kinda transition so now you have that

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:31,309
hasn't in all the languages how do you

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:33,709
get that council house to people so too

00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:35,989
polite includes views and it not just

00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:39,439
includes views as individual views on

00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:41,209
Drupal 7 though it includes views and it

00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:43,819
makes use of fundamental part of the

00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:46,249
system so when you go to the front page

00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:49,400
of the plane it's a view you can

00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:51,680
customize the front page and change

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,339
whatever you want about it but plate was

00:36:51,680 --> 00:37:00,079
how it's filtered it's a table or this

00:36:54,339 --> 00:37:03,319
did you go to the recent comments block

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,029
it's a view to be customized how many

00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:07,699
comments are displayed as a pager on

00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:10,160
that where does it go it has the next a

00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:14,089
little but ever if you go to the node

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,599
admin page the content listing page is a

00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:19,339
view so you can customize what filters

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,469
are available in the page you can

00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:23,660
customize what colors are in this link

00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:25,699
for your pendant administration you can

00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,219
clone the page and create a different

00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:29,870
view for your workflows you can clone a

00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:33,680
pager create different

00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:35,630
 super very powerful so if you

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,360
master views you can do a lot of things

00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:42,050
abuses basically two things it's a query

00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:45,410
builder so you can tell it what to how

00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:47,090
to produce results for you and it's a

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,730
disappointing alert so you can tell you

00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,240
how to display those results it's a

00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:55,100
quite a builder kind of this label and

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,940
it has support for language in both

00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:01,610
areas so in the query builder which is a

00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,430
in the first column in business we have

00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,590
a filter criteria for half the language

00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:09,620
and this is the default front page by

00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:12,620
the way in Drupal 8 it's set up to

00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,210
filter to the translation language equal

00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,280
to the concert language selected for the

00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,080
page so when you switch language on the

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,670
front page from english to hindi it's

00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,930
got a filter to only a minute

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,390
translations or only english

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:26,180
translations by default you can set this

00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:28,610
up to be filtering to the users default

00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,120
or not filtering at all or showing

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:33,950
multiple languages or shall we call me

00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,480
translations that were translated more

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,420
than a month ago and we need to be

00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,550
updated one so it's very easy to build

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,280
up filters are based on your knees and

00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:45,470
then on the rendering side which is in

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,600
the second home here there's a language

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,760
rendering language setting which decides

00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,000
on how the result is actually going to

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,160
be rendered so that default order pocket

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,610
is kind of language of you know just

00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,400
look up the men

00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:02,580
that the result was found in so again

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,410
the vendor whenever we found but you can

00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,060
configure it is to render the original

00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,430
language version of that so you can

00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,410
filter for whatever is not translated to

00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,150
mean yet and then I do it in the

00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,010
language that's its own interests I

00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,110
didn't and then you can trust the

00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,120
community from dairy so it's very easy

00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,550
to build a prairie and then decide how

00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,390
its displayed in views and both of them

00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:28,140
have flexible configurations for

00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:31,350
language and then of course use the

00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,980
output of use is a block that you put on

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,990
a page and the block as language

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,030
visibility so you can use that

00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:50,040
visibility responsive had ensure things

00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:54,210
prison so if you has reviews you're

00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,550
going to have a very good time ah the

00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,910
only unfortunate thing here is the

00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:02,250
migration path for translated content

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:04,290
itself pretty much in the words it's not

00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:07,140
easy to figure out how to migrate from

00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:10,170
both ways in a new way we have proof of

00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,450
concept patches let me testing and need

00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,480
more help so if you want to help in that

00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:18,030
area now is the right time sunny is

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,340
going to be his prints we would love to

00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,560
see you there see how the good news

00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,750
however is we've also built a language

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,140
support to the core search module itself

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,450
and the Search API so it goes about the

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,980
languages of stuff and whatever language

00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:35,160
you tries to search

00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,350
the patent wasn't and indexes these

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,880
translations as separate things it's

00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,760
going to use core search you will find

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,590
in a separate panels and the next has a

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,900
generally ftp access is not good support

00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:49,470
as well so if you use transmission you

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,609
can sell access to the in diversion

00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:53,670
separate from the english version

00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:58,100
because we have access a support program

00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:00,090
which to so that was the third ever

00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,970
multilingual submarket I've known an

00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:05,760
epic access report for language we are

00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:09,210
enacting contents African language

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,580
search ap is no languages migration path

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:14,640
is still in the works thanks anyone

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,310
going to help with that it's all views

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,500
integrated and because a lot of things

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,180
are views if you want to customize how

00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,609
your the landing page handles language

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,490
if you want to put a tab on your blog

00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:28,710
admin page for translators just clone

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,540
that this way put on the tab do whatever

00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,850
with the filters with the displayed is

00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,369
very easy to do this new module mining

00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,960
you home and you can export that into

00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:41,119
configuration and share that with

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,100
whatever other sites no coding required

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,320
it supports all content enemies in car

00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,690
engine trip so it is rules of you

00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,780
seekers if you use workbench whatever

00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:54,480
they will work with the system and it

00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,420
has terminal field and sometimes as a

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,850
field level settings so captain heights

00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,770
economy vocabularies London level and

00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,560
then the field of lilies title author

00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,230
publishing status etc the subject level

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,869
is for some of the fields like files

00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:13,530
riders up your video stream that's

00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:14,750
comfort and we are not done yet so we

00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,960
found this interesting

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:21,260
further work is going to use this very

00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,880
good very good finally calculation

00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,400
transmissions so the good news for this

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,710
is it's totally to refill the project

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,440
interplay because seven had moved

00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:32,480
support project figuration transition so

00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,720
what people complained about is we

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,390
actually transmitted your configuration

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,160
but it was a translate with a copy of

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,160
the transmission at the time when you

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,520
install something when you install

00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,920
Drupal in German you would instantly

00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,620
would create the content heights in kind

00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,300
of German at the time of the

00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,180
installation in the state of the

00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,010
language available at the time and we

00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,570
didn't know what was actually translated

00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,460
and what was not and then later on we

00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,650
never updated that transition anymore

00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,660
and if you change the psychical language

00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:10,180
from Germany hindi we would never have

00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:12,890
any idea if it was in German Pokemon so

00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,290
rubelite with all that problem all of

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,300
those problems one by one so let's say

00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,560
what's less he was configuration in the

00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,260
first place I talked about these

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,380
entities that are a thing is the items

00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:27,920
in into play and we talked about content

00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,830
entities that are usually created on the

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,240
front end and usually have fields on

00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:37,160
them but not all not always true and

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,050
there is configuration as well some of

00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,660
those are entities like views

00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:45,410
vocabularies contacts categories fields

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,030
menus etc and some of them are global

00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:50,360
configuration much as a site information

00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:52,550
your usual emails etc so all of these we

00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,350
know the language of so site information

00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:57,950
and user emails we can locally know

00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:00,360
their language I mean for all the usuals

00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:03,030
information at once and from use

00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,220
vocabularies etc each single one we know

00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,650
their language so each of you we know

00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,590
with which you created that in each or

00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:15,540
culinary each other category filled each

00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:19,830
and you each block block placement some

00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:22,560
of those things there is one area that's

00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:25,080
kind of left over and we did not get

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,770
around to is path aliases is kind of an

00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:32,160
other circle but the main point here is

00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:34,860
we have a general solution that's

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:39,000
extensible to contributed modules for

00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:43,260
content and configuration if you have

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,870
contributed module you are not in the

00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,180
green or the blue circle you are not

00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:50,580
using the captain if you had come the

00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,380
entity API and you are not using the

00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,150
configuration API you're doing something

00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,430
like populace is there something else

00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,250
you are doing your own custom tables

00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:04,440
your own custom data storage whatever

00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:08,040
you are on your own ok we have support

00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:11,010
for you for content we have support for

00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,140
you for configuration if you do

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,560
something else you are not following the

00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:19,440
Drupal framework you gotta be solve your

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,290
own problems so we solve problems in

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,660
these rooms the way did we solve the

00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,910
problem for configuration is we track

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,910
language on each config file each view

00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:33,450
each minus good luck and we store

00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:35,160
language over mice so anybody heard

00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:40,410
about in the configuration system how it

00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,940
works have is deploying many ok so the

00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,650
configuration system interplay is

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,320
totally separated from the content

00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:49,590
system into place and it stores

00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,960
configuration in a way that's easy to

00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,809
deploy it in other environments so you

00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,089
can explore all your configuration

00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:58,699
your site work on it in your development

00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:00,769
environments see the changes they

00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:02,299
provided to life review that your

00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:06,109
chances are fine and deploy those

00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:07,880
changes to life so very easy to do the

00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:09,949
way translation works is there are

00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,109
language overrides two configurations so

00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:15,380
we only store the things that you

00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:16,759
translate it so very important very well

00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,609
with the deployment system for

00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:22,430
configuration in Drupal 8 and it's also

00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:25,069
very easy to translate so for everything

00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:29,449
that is shipped with Drupal core core

00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:31,099
module we have a solution built in the

00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:33,910
interface transmission model so for

00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:37,670
example this is the website feedback

00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:39,829
contact category is that a category

00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,390
that's shipped with the Drupal core so

00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:43,459
I'm going to translate that by going to

00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:47,329
interface translation so user interface

00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:48,829
transition because website feedback was

00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:58,279
shipped with Drupal core I'm going there

00:46:48,829 --> 00:47:01,309
I'm entering my position saying that and

00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:04,249
when I go back there's actually going to

00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:06,469
be English or English side up daryun is

00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:09,109
the language i know most just being

00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:12,739
emulated so this is a configuration that

00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:13,600
was already shipped with record so i can

00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:15,880
use the interface

00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:19,030
such a system for that that's true for

00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,830
all the blocks and all the things the

00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,110
user emails the views everything that

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,270
was shipped with Drupal core the good

00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:28,720
news about this that's an integrated

00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:30,640
with an efficient transmission is it it

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,280
has built-in support for our translation

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,020
uploads and updates from the community

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,730
so when you install Drupal every single

00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:40,620
view that's included every single field

00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:42,970
every single permission every single

00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,410
content height that came with Drupal

00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:47,470
will be translatable by the community

00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,300
will get the translations downloaded and

00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,610
later on the transitions will also be

00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,800
updated from there so there's no problem

00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,930
like for Drupal 7 where we've installed

00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,020
it in the state of uncertainty and we

00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:01,120
had no idea later on etc so we keep

00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:06,640
track of all these things and we have

00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:10,720
made all those transitions so that's how

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,910
that works with the built-in features so

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,650
that we can put up a localized yoga the

00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,210
rock because we know that everybody has

00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:18,250
those features because we downloaded

00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,110
google for all the rest of the

00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:23,860
configuration at you make on your site

00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:25,270
like your site name or your blocks we

00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:27,550
don't know about so you need to

00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:31,810
translate yourself we have a module for

00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:35,230
that too very easy to use so yes that's

00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:36,820
a bark it has a translate block kind

00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:40,420
about it I can just go in there and

00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:44,020
translate the block label to my own

00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:47,170
language I can state the block table go

00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,600
back to the page and now the block is

00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,480
stressful evening how are you so it's

00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,700
easily doable

00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,280
with these implants I deprivation same

00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:00,000
thing translates I information there is

00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,770
a tad less coverages intestines how does

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,869
the people of things I can translate a

00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,940
new intervention stations for all the

00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:12,330
things that are in the same provision in

00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:14,520
the slogan go back now my name is

00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:17,970
krustacia Gary I'm slogan the block tie

00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:23,210
all the compact category all I diagram

00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:25,890
and image is gonna be again so

00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,960
everything is translatable with the

00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:30,359
built-in configuration transmission

00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,770
module you can go in and translate all

00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:34,590
the views that you created you can

00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:39,840
translate all the panto types all the

00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:43,290
vocabularies the menus everything and in

00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,820
its accessible so this works with a

00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:47,430
standard transmission tabs on

00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,170
configuration pages so confused as a

00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:51,450
translate operation in the list code

00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:54,690
menus transient operation go to site

00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:56,970
information translate tab etc etc it

00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:58,830
works with contribution overrides 12

00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:02,220
integrated with the deployment system in

00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:05,220
configuration it works for anything in

00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:06,840
configuration in core encryption and all

00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,790
the ship configuration I came with

00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,070
Drupal and your models and your things

00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:12,930
in your distribution of those things is

00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:15,090
already translatable localized roblero

00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:23,290
in the hopefully

00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:25,510
so who like this area so in summary we

00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:28,360
have four areas where we moved in Drupal

00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:30,670
in terms of multilingual we have a

00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,710
language system which allows you to

00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:37,530
assign language to whatever you want on

00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:37,530
