Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Designing and Implementing Beautiful, Flexible Interfaces
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Design is hard. Implementing a design can be even harder. But fear not! With a good handle on how to use Photoshop and a solid understanding of CSS, the limits on what can be accomplished can be lifted.

In this session I'll cover best practices for designing in Photoshop and implementing those designs with pixel-perfect, yet flexible CSS and HTML. I'll walk through designing key interface elements in Photoshop and then jump over to the browser to show best practices for implenting a design.

This session will dive right into advanced Photoshop techniques including:

Using layer styles alone to style interface elements
The importance of iconography in a UI and how best to incorporate icons
Blend modes and the way they help or hurt your design
Saving time with Smart Objects
Adding texture using Patterns
Creating a Style Guide to organize and maintain interface elements
Once we have a design to work with, we'll move on to implementing the design using the following CSS methods:

The crazy and awesome things you can do with box-shadow
Images, gradients, and layering backgrounds to create depth
Using pseudo elements to avoid unnecessary tags
Scalable vector icons using @font-face
Adding texture to text with mask-image
If you can design it, you can create it on the web.

can improve                               your process and make it more efficient                               and effective at creating beautiful                               flexible and usable designs I'm kenwood                               worth I'm the art director and a partner                               at at and Design Group and you should                               follow me

an update though so don't get too Oh get                                too excited at InDesign group is a web                                design and development shop specializing                                in three areas of service design and                                build support and hosting and we're                                located in Denver Colorado and we create                                websites for organizations doing good                                work all around the world we've done                                work for the Smithsonian some that's                                getting cut off but that's okay the                                United Nations the knight Foundation the                                Center for Investigative Reporting and                                we also did all of the design work for                                drupalcon Denver who made it to denver                                three people yes all right so the                                internet let's talk about it it's an                                awesome time to be a designer working on                                the web isn't it how many people here                                our designers by the way let's let's do                                that first all right how about like                                front-end developers and who calls                                themself a femur okay all right so a bit                                of each that's good well yeah so the                                internet is really awesome there are new                                technologies and techniques that become                                available every day that changed the way                                we design and the way we implement those                                designs on the web it's a really                                exciting time but it's it's important                                with all these new technologies and                                techniques to not get carried away and                                to make sure that we're still focusing                                on the phone                                that's kind of what I want to talk about                                today and I want to start with this                                interesting quote a curious property of                                great design is that it usually goes                                unnoticed by the people who use it this                                is by joshua porter from his principles                                of user interface design article you                                should definitely read through all of                                that it's really awesome and the way I                                like to just describe this is if you                                invite a guest over to your house and                                your house is a mess that leaves a                                really strong negative lasting                                impression with that person but if they                                come over and your house is perfectly                                clean they don't think twice about it                                because that's what they expect well                                that same thing can be applied to                                websites if the user comes to your                                website and has a terrible experience                                then that will leave a long lasting                                impression with them however if it does                                what they expect and it looks it looks                                good then it instead leaves a positive                                impression and then another similar                                quote which sums it up much much more                                succinctly is good design is invisible                                and this is from the verge calm I you                                should open it you actually can't see                                any of the URLs from this but i'll put                                my slides online right after this sorry                                about that so let's talk a little bit                                about the history of designing for the                                web so where did we begin                                I think we all know this right geo                                cities and angel fire and all those                                terrible websites with green text on                                purple backgrounds and everything's                                rotating and spinning it was a dark time                                for design on the web really really glad                                we're past that now but from there we                                took a great step forward to static                                designs that you could then implement                                with table based layout so someone                                figured out that if you used a table you                                could have pixel perfect control over                                your design which was fantastic I mean                                obviously you saw the previous thing                                this is terrible and then all sudden you                                have control over this however if you've                                ever worked with a table based design                                you know that it's it's not all roses it                                has terrible markup it's it's really                                hard to maintain it's not semantics and                                it just wasn't it wasn't the answer it                                 was it was a necessary step but again                                 not the answer and then Along Came flash                                 and flash was kind of like the clouds                                 parted and sun shone through and you had                                 complete control over typography                                 animation interactions color layout                                 everything all you had to have was a                                 plug-in so as we now know that isn't                                 exactly the solution and thankfully                                 Apple has done a good job of kind of                                 killing flash and we're probably seen                                 the last of it now along the same time                                 that flash was coming around CSS two                                 became sort of the standard for creating                                 websites and design and laying out                                 websites and with CSS to we have new                                 layout techniques and also that that                                 sort of brought with it the push for web                                 standards so we now have semantic markup                                 and it's much easier to maintain and                                 control our websites from there we moved                                 on to creating two different versions of                                 our websites and not everyone was doing                                 this obviously it was it's expensive to                                 do this sort of thing but large                                 corporations usually would have a                                 desktop and a mobile version and then                                 this takes us to where we are today with                                 responsive design so how do we approach                                 responsive design well design is hard                                 there is no easy answer if you think                                 about it it's impossible to create a                                 static design for every page of a                                 website so now factored into that all                                 the different possible resolutions you                                 should be targeting and that takes it to                                 a whole new level so it's virtually                                 impossible to do this so what is the                                 best approach to designing responsively                                 and there's sort of this ongoing                                 argument between people who design in                                 photoshop and people who design in the                                 browser and they each have very good                                 points against the other so if you're                                 designing in Photoshop you're designing                                 a static design that's only targeted at                                 one resolution and it's not taking into                                 account all of these other different                                 resolutions you may need to target                                 however if you're designing in the                                 browser you could be caught up in                                 semantics and markup which may not be                                 what you should be focusing on will                                 you're creating that initial design but                                 so with these these two different kind                                 of sides I actually I have a have the                                 answer it doesn't matter it really                                 doesn't matter which direction you take                                 on this what matters is what comes out                                 of your process so as long as the end                                 product is successful for your client                                 and for their users then the steps that                                 you take to get to that product aren't                                 as important so I would encourage you to                                 find your own process and perfect it and                                 constantly work to evolve that process                                 to streamline it and make it better                                 that's kind of what I want to talk about                                 today so at addin we have this sort of                                 three tiered process we have a discovery                                 process to start things off where we're                                 doing information architecture and then                                 that leads into design and                                 implementation sort of happening at the                                 same time there's a lot of crossover but                                 it's a very iterative process so at                                 every step we're asking the client for                                 feedback and we're gathering feedback                                 and how things are working and looking                                 and it's it's constantly evolving                                 the important thing about our design                                 process is that we're actually still                                 doing Photoshop comps but we're not                                 using them to say this is what the site                                 will look like we're using Photoshop                                 comps to establish an art direction for                                 the site and that's a very important                                 distinction you have to educate your                                 clients and say it's impossible for us                                 to show you what the site will look like                                 unless we're working with actual markup                                 on every device so this is what we're                                 using to give you an idea for what it                                 could look like and that's where that's                                 what you're getting sign off on so                                 traditionally our process has been to                                 establish that art direction and get                                 approval from the client and then move                                 right into creating the theme based on                                 that static come but as the front-end                                 developer you have to make a lot of                                 assumptions from that initial design you                                 don't get to see any kind of                                 interactions you don't to see what other                                 pages are looking like so there's                                 there's a lot that isn't out that you                                 aren't being told just from this one                                 static design so we felt like there was                                 a step missing what if anybody have any                                 ideas what that step might be I'm sorry                                 what was that prototyping okay that                                 that's something but in and I guess in                                 our process we're trying to stay away                                 from getting too far into the browser at                                 this point well our answer to this is a                                 style guide how many people are using                                 style guides right now okay great so                                 what is a style guide well we used a                                 style guide to define the look and feel                                 of individual elements of the site and                                 it contains everything from colors and                                 typography to UI elements like buttons                                 tabs tags pagers that sort of thing and                                 it's also a great place to show                                 different interactive states like hover                                 and active and that sort of thing and                                 the style guide is really it's really                                 beneficial to eliminate the guesswork                                 that comes in implementing a design so                                 now a front-end developer can look at a                                 style guide and CEO I know what this                                 button should look like in                                 too many different states or I know how                                 this this input field should react to                                 user input and the added bonus of                                 creating the style guide is that you set                                 yourself up for more modular flexible                                 HTML and CSS and then finally you get to                                 see how all of these elements relate to                                 each other and help support that visual                                 brand that you're trying to establish                                 while you're designing so it's it's very                                 effective at establishing that design                                 direction even further so how many of                                 you are familiar with dribble if you                                 could see the top of this you'd see that                                 there's a logo called gif ille dribble                                 is a website where designers can                                 showcase their work and they only get                                                                                                          their design well in this example I                                 created it's just to showcase animated                                 gifts from dribble and I just wanted to                                 use this to illustrate how you can take                                 a design concept and create a style                                 guide from that and so in this case this                                 is the style guide and this is a very                                 simplified style guide usually a final                                 product of a style guide will be much                                 more complex than this but for this                                 example this should give you an idea so                                 let's take a closer look we we start                                 with colors and colors are very                                 important to establish up front and                                 especially as you're writing CSS to make                                 sure you have a good handle on what all                                 the colors that will be used in the site                                 are in our process we use sass so we can                                 create variables that are that are set                                 to each of these colors and so we've                                 established sort of a naming convention                                 so that middle column is the base color                                 and then you have lighter and darker                                 versions of that color that you can use                                 in your design from there we move on to                                 typography and here we're outlining                                 which fonts you can use and also setting                                 up some default styles for fonts and                                 that's this is something that can                                 definitely change as you're implementing                                 the site none of this needs to be set in                                 stone again it's just                                 to establish some more guidance as                                 you're implementing the design we also                                 outlined some image sizes to make sure                                 that the images that are being created                                 on the site are aligning to the grid and                                 with responsive design there's a little                                 flexibility here so that's just                                 something to keep in mind this section                                 for UI elements it can actually grow to                                 be very complex so in this case I've                                 kept it simple and just touched on some                                 buttons but you can see I've got a                                 primary button with a normal hover and                                 an active state and then some secondary                                 and tertiary button styles and if you                                 set that all up in in advance then it's                                 much faster to implement these the                                 design we break forms out into their own                                 section because forms will sometimes                                 have sort of a different visual style                                 from other elements of the site and                                 different interactions so in this case                                 you can see like the the input field                                 there for a user name has an icon and                                 the inline label and that that is                                 different from how the text area is                                 being handled with the label being above                                 that the element and then finally we                                 have sort of a catch-all section for                                 miscellaneous elements in this case this                                 is an image holder that you can see a                                 different state for when someone has                                 actually liked an image and then we're                                 also showing a date style that could be                                 used you could move that to the                                 typography section if that makes sense                                 but here if you've got it down here you                                 can expand that so if you've got other                                 date Styles you're using throughout the                                 site you can add them in this one                                 central area so this is just a dummy                                 style guide I put together for this but                                 there are others out there this is one                                 called pairs and I will read you the URL                                 p EA RS and this is one created by Dan                                 cederholm simple bits and it's this is                                 this may be more of a pattern library                                 that's a little bit different from a                                 style guide but they're kind of in the                                 same family but it's definitely worth                                 checking out for inspiration bigot just                                 relaunched their new design bigoted calm                                 and to go along with that they have a                                 nice blog post                                 how they how they created the design and                                 part of that was the style guide that                                 they created and so this is another good                                 example that you can use for inspiration                                 for style guides this style guide is                                 actually from starbucks and it's a very                                 simple style guide may be more of a                                 pattern library I'm not sure it's very                                 it's just very simple but it gets into                                 things like borders and arrangements of                                 blocks and different ad layouts and that                                 sort of thing and then if you really                                 want some guidance there's a nice post                                 again I'll put all these slides online                                 so you can get the URLs later there's a                                 nice post called a style guide guide by                                 a list holiday which gets into things                                 you may want to add into your style                                 guide and some guidance for that so it's                                 definitely worth reading so I talked in                                 general about how you can adjust your                                 process to include a style guide but now                                 I want to talk about some very specific                                 things and i'm going to i'm going to go                                 over some of the tools that i use as a                                 designer every day so i'm going to start                                 with photoshop so who here uses                                 photoshop first of all all right how                                 about fireworks you all can leave after                                 Stan it's important with any of the                                 tools you use to really master them and                                 to constantly be looking for ways to                                 improve your workflow with them and and                                 photoshop i think is is a really                                 effective tool that i think some people                                 are really down on but i think once you                                 really learn it and master it it can be                                 really effective for creating designs                                 and part of that is knowing how to                                 navigate it there are different ways you                                 can navigate in photoshop i'm going to                                 cover like two different ways here but                                 the layers panel and all of the visual                                 UI that you can click through having a                                 good understanding of that is really key                                 especially the layers panel because this                                 is where you're getting into organizing                                 your document and having a really well                                 structured layer layers panel is really                                 important so you have things like layer                                 groups and patterns clipping masks shape                                 layers layer styles I mean it keeps                                 going there adjustment layers and all                                 sorts of other things you can be doing                                 in this panel so there's a lot of                                 content getting packed into this one                                 element                                 you can you can adjust opacity and fill                                 you can actually edit now with cs                                      can edit layered names and tab to the                                 next next name so that's a much faster                                 way to interact the layers panel if                                 you're renaming things so getting                                 getting a good handle on weight the ways                                 you can interact with the the interface                                 is key on top of that knowing keyboard                                 shortcuts these are some of the i would                                 say some of the more important ones in                                 this case selecting layers so if you                                 have a layer selected in the layers                                 panel if you press option and an open or                                 closed bracket you can move up and down                                 in your selection command + open and                                 close bracket will actually move the                                 layer in that layer order copy merged is                                 kind of a unique one that if you have a                                 marquee selection on part of your image                                 and you press command shift see it will                                 copy all of the visible elements within                                 that Marky so that can be useful if                                 you're if you want to say send a quick                                 section of a design to someone in an                                 email or something like that copy color                                 as hex this is a new one I just picked                                 up a little while ago but what this does                                 is it'll copy the foreground color in                                 Photoshop as a hex value so this is                                 really awesome if you're implementing a                                 design and CSS instead of having to open                                 the the the color panel every time you                                 want it to get a hex value you just hit                                 this key command and this I've actually                                 set up a custom one for myself here and                                 you can do that yourself in in the                                 keyboard settings keyboard shortcut                                 settings you can also change blend modes                                 all with a keyboard shortcut so this                                 this is a really quick way to adjust                                 blend modes for layers and then finally                                 moving through the history this is                                 something that I do all the time so if                                 you just hit command Z it'll toggle                                 between the previous state and the                                 current one and that doesn't really get                                 you very far but moving back with                                 command option Z you can actually go                                 much further into the history depending                                 on how many history states you've set up                                 in Photoshop the only caveat with this                                 is that if you make any changes after                                 you've moved back you can't go back                                 forward so it's like the butterfly                                 effect ER but iron anyway                                 another key principle in designing and                                 Photoshop is non-destructive design so                                 if you're creating say rasterized                                 graphics or bitmap graphics and you need                                 to adjust those you can find yourself in                                 a place where you can't go back and                                 you've basically destroyed those                                 elements but with a few changes to how                                 you approach things you can make your                                 your process much more flexible for                                 editing things so in this case vector                                 and shape layers are a good example so                                 we've got a just a rectangle with                                 rounded corners really simple say it's a                                 button on your site and you decide I                                 want to pair this button with an input                                 field like it's a search field with a go                                 button next to it so using a vector                                 shape you can actually knock out half of                                 that shape and that does not destroy the                                 layer so if later you decide oh I want                                 to unpair that button you just delete                                 that mask and all of a sudden you can                                 you have the full button again this is a                                 very simple example but if you're                                 working with icons if you've created                                 icons in a vector format you can scale                                 them all you want if you create them in                                 a bitmap format your limited so                                 definitely something to keep in mind                                 also Smart Objects smart objects are                                 really useful in Photoshop so if you                                 have a logo that you want to import say                                 say you don't have a vector version of a                                 logo you just have a PNG so if you                                 import that P&G into your Photoshop                                 document scale it down and then later                                 you find out that you need to enlarge it                                 because clients always want you to make                                 the logo bigger right well in this case                                 you've destroyed that image you don't                                 have that data anymore to make that logo                                 bigger but if you bring that PNG in and                                 convert it to a smart object you can                                 adjust that size as much as you want and                                 that won't destroy the original content                                 another benefit to Smart Objects is that                                 if you have a repeating elements so if                                 let's say you're designing a form and                                 you have a section of the form with                                    checkboxes on it don't ever do that by                                 the way that would be terrible but if                                 you needed to change the design of those                                 checkboxes you could easily do that in                                 one place with a smart object and that                                 would update all those other                                 boxes so that's definitely something to                                 keep in mind and then finally you can                                 apply filters to smart objects that are                                 non-destructive so if you apply a blur                                 to a bitmap you can't unblurred later                                 but if you apply a blur to a smart                                 object you can adjust that blur and                                 remove it if you need to later on also                                 having a really good grasp of color                                 styles and patterns in Photoshop                                 Photoshop of course gives you a lot of                                 control over to all of these things and                                 I want to first talk about blend modes                                 so I typically use for blend modes                                 normal multiply screen and overlay and I                                 think if I'm ever using a blend mode                                 beside normal usually its overlay and I                                 want to go through a quick example of                                 what overlay does for colors this in                                 this example I have a blue stripe that                                 I've applied black and white on top set                                 at fifty percent so you can see the                                 black makes the blue darker and the                                 white makes it lighter but it's also                                 getting a little bit d saturated now if                                 you do that same thing but set them to                                 overlay it keeps the saturation and just                                 brightens or darkens the color itself so                                 this is that I think this is something                                 that if you're if you're doing anything                                 with layer styles which I'll talk about                                 in just a sec overlay using black and                                 white is really useful so layer styles                                 this is another one of those panels in                                 Photoshop that's just chock-full of                                 interface there's a lot you can do here                                 but the thing to keep in mind is that                                 all these layer styles relate to things                                 you can do in CSS and if you're thinking                                 about that as you're designing you know                                 it helps to to make sure that you're                                 actually creating things that can be                                 implemented and that's that's really                                 important one thing I want to mention is                                 the global light setting in Photoshop so                                 if you have this checked if you apply a                                 layer style using global light it'll all                                 use the same angle and then later if you                                 needed to change that you could and it                                 would apply across the board and your                                 document the only problem with this is                                 that if you move those elements to a new                                 document that has a differ                                 global light it will inherit the new                                 global light and so they won't look the                                 same so I would advise you to uncheck it                                 if you can and just not not do that also                                 patterns are really really handy to use                                 in Photoshop in this case you can use                                 patterns for texture and these are all                                 patterns from a website called subtle                                 patterns calm and they actually have a                                 dot p                                                            Photoshop and it has over                                               patterns that you can use so it's a                                 really great resource but you can also                                 use patterns for different things in                                 this case I'm using it for a baseline                                 grid so in every Photoshop document I                                 create I establish a baseline grid in                                 this case it's a six-point baseline grid                                 and usually it's not this dark I usually                                 have it at about five percent opacity so                                 it's a like a subtle guide for laying                                 out your type but this is a great way to                                 kind of maintain your vertical rhythm in                                 your document and this is a really easy                                 thing to create you just draw a line and                                 draw a rectangle with how how much space                                 you want as the line height and then                                 you're you created a pattern and it's                                 all set alright so now I want to talk                                 about a real quick example these two                                 buttons on the left here are all using                                 the same layer style and the two buttons                                 on the writer using the same layer style                                 so this may be a simple question which                                 buttons look better but okay what's                                 wrong with the buttons on the right                                 there you go ok so d saturated there                                 blurred ok there there are a number of                                 things obviously if this is a this is a                                 no-brainer basically so you can see the                                 the border radius on the buttons on the                                 right they've got different border radii                                 on each side so that looks terrible the                                 colors that are being applied for the                                 layer styles are just being applied                                 using multiply or screen and that's                                 desaturating the colors they're actually                                 the buttons on either side are using the                                 same base color but you can see how much                                 that can mess up what your colors look                                 like so in this case this orange is now                                 turning into a muddy brown and it just                                 doesn't look great there's also a drop                                 shadow that's too strong so the buttons                                 look like instead of being                                 three-dimensional it looks like they're                                 just kind of hovering off of the page so                                 you know this is this is a real simple                                 example of how you can screw up layer                                 styles and taken to the extreme so I've                                 talked about Photoshop and how this is                                 setting you up for your CSS so let's                                 talk about the CSS now and to start I                                 want to mention a couple books this                                 one's called scalable and modular                                 architecture for CSS otherwise known as                                 smacks you can go to SMA CSS calm and                                 you can buy this book it's pretty                                 inexpensive and there's a digital                                 version and everything but basically                                 this is an approach to CSS that sort of                                 modularize a--'s your CSS so instead of                                 instead of writing the traditional                                 drupal style of ID field dash field                                 ashfield underscored node field you know                                 kind of a mess this approach simplifies                                 your selectors and how you're                                 structuring your your HTML in your                                 markup so I recommend this book and then                                 these are the a book apart books just                                 some of them a book apart has a number                                 of books now I think they're up to seven                                 but all of them are great so and they're                                 really quick reads definitely worth                                 checking out I want to talk quickly                                 about preprocessors i'm going to give                                 some CSS examples in a bit and they're                                 all going to be in SAS but there are a                                 couple different preprocessors                                 are at the forefront right now and they                                 are SAS less and stylist so SAS is                                 really the one you should use okay all                                 right let's do it again who uses SAS who                                 uses less and who uses stylus are you                                 know what stylus is any any others that                                 I didn't name okay what was that more                                 I've never heard of that oh ok so i will                                 say to anyone using less i used less for                                 probably a year and a half and then when                                 SAS came out with the S CSS syntax so it                                 mirrors CSS better I made the switch and                                 I haven't looked back it's a game                                 changer you should totally switch to                                 sass there were there were like three                                 buffs on SAS today in a session                                 yesterday so there's AB off right now if                                 you want to leave and go to that please                                 don't but with SAS you get compass                                 encompasses a library for SAS that adds                                 in a number of CSS features it adds in a                                 number of different ways to handle                                 typography browser support it's a it's a                                 really great tool for writing your CSS                                 and definitely simplifies things so                                 instead of having to write out all the                                 browser prefixes and that sort of thing                                 this handles it for you and then on top                                 of that there are other extensions like                                 break point is one of the more recent                                 ones that handles nested media queries                                 so you can write you can write a                                 selector and then inside that you can                                 say in this element i want it to adjust                                 on this media query and change you know                                 i change this property i recommend                                 checking that out it's it's break point                                 that that's what it's called and should                                 be easy to find online so now I want to                                 talk about some specific CSS things and                                 I'm going to start with box sizing so                                 years ago ie did this really weird thing                                 where if you set a width on an element                                 and then applied padding                                 that padding would get applied inside                                 the element and everybody looked at that                                 and was like what are you doing this is                                 totally different from how everybody                                 else does padding padding goes on the                                 outside so in a normal case if you have                                 two elements and you want them to be say                                 half of the width of the page that you                                 want them to sit side by side fifty                                 percent fifty percent if you were to add                                 padding to those elements all of a                                 sudden they don't fit anymore but with                                 box sizing border-box that makes it so                                 the padding is applied inside the                                 element so you can keep those elements                                 side by side so this totally changes how                                 you handle responsive designs so now you                                 no longer have to factor in that math                                 for padding you just have to handle the                                 widths and also with this it also makes                                 sure that the borders are inside at the                                 same time so he actually had something                                 right and it's amazing but anyway now                                 everybody's getting on board with css                                  we now have our DBA so now all of a                                 sudden all those alpha values from                                 Photoshop can come over into your CSS in                                 this case I'm using a variable with sass                                 they let you do a shorthand version                                 normally you would have to write out the                                 RGB and a values but with sass you can                                 pass in a variable for the color set the                                 Alpha and it'll figure the rest out for                                 you we also have multiple backgrounds so                                 if you're if you're working with                                 different layers that are all applied to                                 the same element you can do that now in                                 CSS it's a little trickier but you                                 definitely have more flexibility than                                 you did in the past so in this case I                                 have the bottom layer is an image with                                 it it's just a textured background and                                 then on top of that I've done a gradient                                 where I'm using our DVD rgba values to                                 apply white on top of it and I'm going                                 to talk a little bit more about this and                                 why this isn't a great example but                                 that'll be in just a second so I think                                 one of the one of the biggest things and                                 you probably all know this by now but                                 box shadow and text shadow have                                 definitely changed the way we approach                                 design for the web so now all of those                                 layer styles that ukraine photoshop drop                                 shadow outer glow inner glow                                 enter shadow those can all be applied as                                 box shadows in CSS and with CSS you even                                 have more flexibility than photoshop                                 because in Photoshop you're limited to                                 only a set number of those but in CSS                                 you can go crazy and have a hundred                                 different box shadows or text shadows                                 and you have complete control over them                                 you have a number of different options                                 too so you can have an inset shadow like                                 on the second line here you can also                                 have a spread for the value which will                                 mean that say you have a spread of five                                 pixels it'll apply that shadow in its                                 full value out                                                      blurring it so you have a lot of                                 flexibility there with text shadow                                 you're a little more limited but again                                 you still have more flexibility than you                                 did before we even had that I just want                                 to talk about pseudo element pseudo                                 elements are a really great tool for                                 designing now so in the past if you                                 wanted to include an icon on say a                                 button you would have to apply that as a                                 background image or include some                                 presentational markup in your HTML to                                 get that icon to show up well now with                                 pseudo elements you can actually inject                                 that element with CSS so in this case                                 this is a somewhat advanced example but                                 it's it's injecting the text right after                                 a button and in this case it's using                                 symbol set and I'll talk about that in                                 just a second but if you were to look at                                 this in HTML you would see that there's                                 now the text ri ght after the text of                                 the button and you can style that you                                 have complete control of that separate                                 from the rest of that element so I                                 mentioned symbol set it's just symbol                                 set calm and you can see here that                                 they've written out works on a desktop                                 and mobile device if you go to the                                 website you can actually see they type                                 this out and as they're typing out                                 desktop as soon as they finish typing                                 that word it converts it to the icon so                                 simple set is using ligatures to take                                 combinations of characters and create                                 icons so now we have semantic icons on                                 the web which is really exciting the                                 benefit to this is that they're also                                 scalable so there                                 after based with symbol set you set a                                 point size so if you set it at say you                                 know                                                                    icon so you have complete control over                                 that this is this is a really exciting                                 advancement and i think that there's                                 going to be a lot more of this in the                                 future this one costs thirty bucks                                 there's a social version that costs a                                 buck and that gives you like Twitter and                                 Facebook and                                                          think they're definitely worth it                                 there's another library called font                                 awesome and this one's free this ones                                 used by bootstrap Twitter bootstrap but                                 in this case the characters are not done                                 with ligatures they're they're done to                                 unicode characters so it's not semantic                                 markup but it's still better than                                 including presentational markup in your                                 HTML and then this one this is a pretty                                 funky one called Chartwell and this is a                                 font and you wouldn't even know it but                                 the way this works is it takes values                                 and creates graphs or charts out of                                 those values this does not have a web                                 version yet but they are working on it                                 and I'm really excited to see what                                 happens when they when they release this                                 but it's pretty cool and then finally                                 just this morning this blog post came                                 out Josh Emerson co uk and this blog                                 post is about how to create your own                                 vector icon fonts so if you have a logo                                 that say a one color logo when you want                                 to include that in your site as a vector                                 version and then that will work on you                                 know retina displays and not be                                 pixelated this walks you through how to                                 actually do that and it's a it's a Mac                                 tutorial but there may be similar things                                 need to do on it on a Windows machine so                                 I talked a lot about blend modes and                                 unfortunately blend modes on the web                                 they're not quite there yet they're not                                 there at all in fact which is really sad                                 but luckily                                 photo Sharad sorry adobe has actually                                 released a version of WebKit it's like a                                 beta release that you can download from                                 their site that includes blend modes so                                 you have ways to stack elements on top                                 of each other and apply them as blend                                 modes and also apply layer styles as                                 blend modes or box shadows blend modes                                 so that's exciting that'll be a while                                 before that's available in every browser                                 so don't get too excited but this last                                 one I want to talk about you can't see                                 the URL it's scss dash blend dash modes                                 just do a search for that this is a SAS                                 library that lets you use blend mode                                 functions to get the colors that you                                 that you want based on an initial color                                 so you say i want you know this orange                                 with fifteen percent white applied on                                 top of it and it'll give you that                                 correct blend mode if you use blend                                 overlay or blend multiply as all of that                                 built in so it's really exciting and                                 that's I want to I want to walk you                                 through an example so in this case this                                 is a sign up button that's all using the                                 same markup and the only difference here                                 is that they're each getting passed in                                 one color value so it's all it's all a                                 very flexible markup that you can adjust                                 I'm going to quickly walk you through                                 that so this in this case we're just                                 going to create a really simple button                                 so the mark-up is a class equals button                                 href equals whatever it's a sign up                                 button I've set a button color so that's                                 the that's the base color for the button                                 and that'll get used in a number of                                 different places so this is SAS syntax                                 so I have I have variables I'm doing                                 things like including adjust font size                                 to that's something you can use to align                                 your text to your baseline grid I I've                                 set a border radius so that's handling                                 all the browser prefixes for me and then                                 down here I actually so I'm doing                                 something kind of funny here this is a                                 silent extend and with that I don't want                                 to get it too too far into the details                                 of this but base                                 tically what that does is it simplifies                                 the way your CSS is written so instead                                 of taking all this code and including it                                 a hundred different times throughout                                 your document it rewrites all your                                 selectors to just appear at that one                                 place so every time you extend this it                                 just adds another selector to that area                                 so I'm extending that button base and                                 setting the background color to the                                 button color and that gives us this okay                                 so that's our start up bad okay so now                                 we want the gradient so we want to add                                 the gradient this element so in this                                 case i'm doing a linear gradient from                                 top to bottom that's starting with that                                 base button color and then here I'm                                 using blend overlay so with the overlay                                 you want to pass in the color you want                                 to be applied to the base color so here                                 I'm passing in black at twenty-five                                 percent on top of the base color and                                 that's going to darken that color it may                                 be a little hard to see on the screen                                 but there you go so now we've got a                                 gradient that's still in the same color                                 family but there are also some layer                                 styles I want to apply so there's an                                 inner shadow and an inner glow on this                                 button so the inner shadow again I'm                                 using blend overlay and RGB a combined                                 to apply these layer layer styles and                                 that you can see it has a somewhat                                 darker line of shadow on the bottom and                                 there's a brighter glow coming in but in                                 the design we also have an icon that we                                 want to add so in this case I've changed                                 the mark-up slightly by adding a few                                 more classes so the first class I've                                 added is button icon right so that's a                                 presentational class that I'm adding to                                 control how that icon is displayed and                                 then the second that I've added is SS                                 dash navigate right so that's the symbol                                 set icon class that will automatically                                 add the icon for me so it it writes the                                 pseudo plastic the pseudo element to add                                 the icon which is really exciting so it                                 greatly simplifies adding icons to your                                 mark                                 but I have this presentational class                                 built in so I can control where that                                 markup is showing up normally it would                                 just be in line I think they typically                                 do be                                                                    that before element and I'm absolutely                                 positioning it within that button and                                 you can see so now I've got this icon                                 just off to the right well that's not                                 quite how we want it to look there was                                 also like a darker color behind that                                 icon so how do we add that this is                                 getting kind of complex there are many                                 layers to this button element it's all                                 starting with some really simple markup                                 so to do that all we do is write this                                 CSS so now I'm adding another pseudo                                 element this is an after element and                                 basically this is just a square that                                 gets applied to the right side of that                                 button that has darker versions of that                                 orange so it's again using the blend                                 modes in SAS to get the colors that we                                 want and then adding that element into                                 the design so here you can see it now                                 has that darker color so we've got this                                 button created and the only the only                                 color we're using is that one color                                 value that button color that we started                                 with so this means that we can pass in a                                 different button color so blue or green                                 and that's really flexible and this this                                 isn't like a library or something this                                 is something that you can write yourself                                 you know that there are there button                                 libraries out there but I strongly                                 encourage you to avoid them and do your                                 own thing because they you'll end up                                 with a site that looks just like                                 everybody else's site like anyway I'm a                                 bit of a snob in that respect I guess                                 but you can do this it's really it's                                 really not that complex but now what                                 happens if we pass in a light color so                                 we've got this white text in this white                                 icon if we pass in a lighter color those                                 aren't going to show up well with sass                                 tada we've got some logic so we can                                 actually detect the lightness of that                                 base color so in this case I'm saying if                                 it's lighter than                                                     scale of                                                          lighter end of the spectrum do something                                  else so                                  this case it's changing how the box                                  shadow is applied and it's changing the                                  the colors of the element or of the text                                  and of the icon and it's also changing                                  the text shadow so this is an example of                                  just some of the different buttons that                                  are all using the same markup same CSS                                  with only one different variable getting                                  passed in and if you want to check this                                  out I made a gist of it on github so you                                  can play around with this and definitely                                  like let me know if you end up using it                                  somewhere and you know see ways to                                  improve it I'm sure it's you know it's                                  something I threw together for this                                  presentation so I'm sure there are ways                                  to make it better it's definitely worth                                  checking out so thanks everybody I would                                  encourage you to rate this session i                                  created a bitly link there so you can                                  get there easily and definitely follow                                  me on Twitter and check out my website                                  it might be updated in a couple of years                                  so I do we have any questions yes                                  yes yeah and that's something I should                                  have mentioned so you create the initial                                  Photoshop version of it which is just                                  you know an editable Photoshop document                                  but then you you also have to implement                                  that in CSS and the benefit of that is                                  that I'm sorry the question was do you                                  create an HTML and CSS version of the                                  style guide but the benefit of doing                                  that is that you're you're looking at                                  your markup and your CSS in a more                                  modular way so you're taking it out of                                  the context of your site and creating                                  these base based styles that will be                                  much more flexible as you're                                  implementing the site so then later if                                  you need to change how they look in a                                  certain context you can do that without                                  changing it across the board so yeah I                                  definitely you definitely should also                                  implement it in CSS and HTML any other                                  questions yes                                  the question was does it work with an                                  older version of explorer I'd no it does                                  not there are there are polyfills that                                  you can use to get some of these things                                  working with explorer but you should be                                  writing your CSS to degrade in in                                  certain browsers you know it's                                  eventually we're going to have to stop                                  supporting explorer and just start                                  writing good HTML and CSS so                                  unfortunately that's that's the answer                                  mm-hmm                                  the question was yeah so so if you're                                  not using blend modes and sass so in a                                  case where you may not even be using SAS                                  which a lot of people aren't that's                                  understandable that the question is how                                  do you get that same effect and how do                                  you get overlay blend modes in CSS                                  because typically if you're just                                  applying white on top of a color you're                                  not going to get the right effect I                                  guess what I would do is in Photoshop I                                  would take that overlay effect however                                  that is being applied set it to a                                  hundred percent opacity and eyedropper                                  that color and then use that color with                                  an RGB a value set at the elfa you had                                  originally is that does that make sense                                  I can I can demo it for you if you want                                  want to come up afterwards any other                                  questions                                  yet so the question was your it am I                                  saying that you you're declaring one                                  color value and then that's getting used                                  everywhere is that okay so that I guess                                  really the question is how it so great                                  right                                  so if you're in if you're in Photoshop                                  what you need to do is start with how                                  you have your button designed in this                                  case and just set that one layer style                                  to one hundred percent opacity and then                                  eyedropper it wherever it's at its                                  strongest version that wherever that                                  layer style so say you have an inner                                  glow and on this orange button it may                                  look really yellow so it becomes a very                                  bright yellow color so you want to                                  eyedropper that yellow and then use the                                  RGBA values there but the RGB values and                                  put the elf evalu set to what you had                                  initially so if you had a that inner                                  glow set to fifteen percent you want to                                  do rgba the yellow color point one five                                  any other questions alright well thank                                  you all very much
