Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Move over PIFR, there's a new bot in town!
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	It's been nearly four years since the initial testing.drupal.org launch, and the introduction of automated QA testing into the Drupal.org environment. Since then, the testing infrastructure has chugged steadily along; quietly ignored, forgotten, and even abandoned for long stretches along the way. For the last four years, PIFT and PIFR have silently done their thing, putting up with more than their share of blame, abuse, and cursing when things went wrong..

But years of semi-neglect have taken their toll ... and while strategic use of duct tape and bailing twine might keep things running 'as-is' for a while longer, architectural limitations within the code mean that this dog is simply too old to learn any new tricks.

Enter the 'Conduit' and 'Worker' projects. Developed and fully released by Jimmy Berry (boombatower), these projects were written from the ground up to address the architectural limitations inherent in the existing PIFT/PIFR solution. Together, they provide a much more flexible and sustainable foundation for future testing infrastructure capabilities; as evidenced by a number of new features enabled by the platform on day one.

This session will:

Provide an introduction and overview of the Conduit/Worker architecture
Present a number of new testing infra capabilities enabled by the solution
Demonstrate extensibility of the platform and how to develop new testing plugins
Discuss how the solution improves long-term testing infra sustainability
Identify how anyone can help contribute to the improvement of Drupal's testing infrastructure

                    has been patched into another test                               who has ever had a problem with the                               patch that almost everybody                               boo has written a patch specifically for                               the Tesla                               boo is a past or current maintainer of                                the testing of destruction                                there is happening I was going to say if                                anyone raise their hand there that was                                my exit strategy better be careful for                                those I haven't met before my name is                                Jeremy Carson I am a drupal hobbyist                                who's been using Drupal for about five                                years my drupal adored profile lists my                                job as a long tail developer which is to                                say I represent the long tail and one                                are freelancers and obvious who don't                                really use Drupal a day job but just                                because we enjoy it right so my day job                                is actually in network engineering and                                network architecture for the next line                                of my profile lists my job title has                                drew pole test spot cardiologists which                                is to say I'm a maintainer of the test                                pots and do what I can to keep them                                running and when problems arise people                                come up and say hey I got an issue                                trying                                the IRC bot on the drupal contribute                                channel list me as grupal test spot EMT                                which is incorrect I have a day job so                                I'm Seldon the first person I see you                                prefer to think of it as more the                                outcome in after the fact loosened up                                troubleshooting who some bug fixing time                                zone whatever the issue might be so I've                                been maintaining the automated testing                                infrastructure of her boat                                              I fell into the role when I started I                                didn't have any particular affinity                                interests or experience with automated                                testing what I really wanted to do was                                missed a module on drupal.org and that's                                why I found myself in the back of the                                project applications queue behind                                    other developers thinking there has                                really got to be a better way here so                                being somewhat naive I thought we got an                                automatic testing in structure let's use                                an automated project reviews and I'm                                gonna challenge myself to make that                                happen I said I was a little naive I                                said how hard could it be you gave                                yourself or weeps and that Miss                                appearance                                fortunately for the community when I set                                my mind to a task I can get extremely                                stubborn and bolt head and will not give                                up until he's done so so here I am so in                                terms of an agenda for the session today                                I'm going to talk a little bit about the                                problems that i ran into trying to get                                kipper to do something different than                                what was originally built for so a                                little bit of discussion some of the                                issues around into their some of the                                issues that we run into as maintain errs                                of the test body structure and then i'm                                going to go into introducing two                                projects called conduit and worker which                                are proposing as something to deploy as                                the next generation of testing so i'll                                do a little bit of history talk about                                where that came from what are the bells                                and whistles what is this platform give                                us that other that we don't have the                                current infrastructure time permitting                                and i suspect because anyone who's seen                                any my phones no I'm not gravity is not                                my strong point so we may not have time                                but that I'll do a little bit of                                plugging walking it's in the slides if                                you want to look at it as far as what it                                takes to build new testing functionality                                on this proposed platform so there's                                information there and there's a little                                bit some very big code samples each                                other and from that talk a little bit                                where we are now with the plan into the                                platform with development the platform                                and some of our next steps where do you                                go from here                                so all right i should point out i listed                                this problem with pepper but it's a bit                                of a misnomer paper itself was built to                                do one thing and it does it very well it                                 runs simple set simple test test cases                                 for the most part I know everyone's run                                 into troubles with it but for the number                                 of test cases that runs in the number of                                 patches at Haun's every day it does its                                 job so when I say the problem clipper                                 here it's really the problems that I                                 encountered trying to make paper do                                 something else trying to extend this to                                 be things that it wasn't clean digital                                 design the main issue from an                                 architectural standpoint is hipper was                                 originally designed with this concept of                                 environments we want to be able to test                                 on my sequel we want to be able to test                                 control stress one of the end of the                                 testing different versions of PHP so                                 this environment concept was built into                                 the test pots and you're in the mood                                 with the existing version of the death                                 of us and then we turned around we said                                 well we want to do more than simple                                 tests we want to do these quarter                                 reviews inspired and we papa de got this                                 environment functionality let's use it                                 so instead of a we have a my simple test                                 minus                                                                    coder environment                                 that's not really the underlying                                 environment that we're testing on what                                 we're doing we're bastardizing this                                 environments future and using it to run                                 new testing functionality it worked well                                 they did what wanted to move where it                                 runs into problems is that lets say we                                 now want to do an environment and UV had                                 me do some grammar parser so it's never                                 pretty soon we've got seven different                                 testing function rooms that will run                                 around on this test but now we turn                                 around decide without all those mines                                 Bell you want to run on full stress well                                 now we've got                                                           running on a pacifier now let's try and                                 add php                                                                 it doesn't scale very well the main                                 issue here is that if you want to run a                                 test on a given project there is no way                                 of saying I just want to run this test                                 on this environment today and this and                                 this other environment tomorrow it's an                                 all or nothing so when you run a test it                                 runs through all of the environments                                 that are proposed items so as a result                                 as we scale up number environments we                                 delay                                 taste test because we will not get                                 result back for any of those tests until                                 all of the environments have completed                                 successfully and on top of that any one                                 of those environments has some sort of                                 benefit excuse me some sort of failure                                 where it doesn't return the result you                                 don't get results for any of the events                                 so it's a little bit of an architectural                                 limitation that hinders us when we try                                 to point new functional units                                 from a maintainer perspective we all                                 have this issue of stability and bugs so                                 when a bugs found in a test or test                                 fails got this issue where is it what's                                 the cause is it the testing                                 infrastructure is it the projects under                                 test is it a simple test inside before                                 is it Stan user error so from a                                 maintainer perspective it's the very                                 difficult to track down where these                                 issues coming from now that's not                                 something going to solve with a new                                 platform but I mentioned it here because                                 the program ran into with                                           which is the existing infrastructure is                                 that we caught all the local food fruit                                 and what we're left with is the problems                                 that were intermittent random and                                 non-repeatable I don't know how many of                                 you know this but when Drupal                                           fails and someone goes in there clicks                                 the retest button can't have both your                                 head that wipes out all the evidence of                                 that test in that failure and we don't                                 have anything left to troubleshoot why                                 that failure occurred so that's a little                                 bit of initiative and we've had a bit of                                 a tendency lately too spectacular                                 failure                                 test spot breaking failures probably the                                 worst example beautiful in Denver sprint                                 day where we turned up                                                   by nine thirty in the morning eight of                                 the weekend now the main result of that                                 was test pots from running out of memory                                 you run the database inside of memory                                 crashing the database Drupal site would                                 go offline and would not be able to spin                                 itself back up fortunately thanks to Sun                                 border officials couple letters they                                 track down the cause of this in simple                                 test last month and you no longer have                                 that                                 maybe my life                                 so from maintainability perspective the                                 other issue got is this sort of                                 dependability and innocent change so                                 with the push to Drupal                                                  room at our the author and architect of                                 the existing system had seen some of                                 these limitations in his system and                                 wanted to change the                                                    was busy in the midst of REE are                                 connecting the live system moving from                                 working one way working another way and                                 was asked to stop touching things                                 because as he was adjusting the                                 architecture he was affecting the                                 ability for people to test patches and                                 that the v                                                          actually ask to step back and leave                                 things alone for long we're sort of the                                 same situation right now where we've got                                 dupa late we're in pushing towards                                 Drupal                                                                  in December and now we want to develop a                                 new test environment a little bit about                                 challenge there so the current plan is                                 we're going to leave the existing                                 structure in place killed this in                                 parallel so we'll have the existing                                 stable and destructive been pushed wait                                 but still have a platform ever develop                                 new feature                                 and I will spare you my little bitta                                 soap box about that learning curve                                 communicators making it hard for new                                 people to come in                                 a lot of turnover or new blood ever                                 entering you tested the test by HUP                                 the main reason for that is that                                 complexity there's no real single view                                 of the code is in one place people can                                 look as it is multiple projects and                                 repositories and when you do get into it                                 you got sort of a complicated execution                                 flow through the project server project                                 the client project it would refill                                 console it is a complex piece that also                                 makes it very difficult to set up local                                 festivals we would talk a little bit                                 earlier hear about wanting wanting your                                 own test environment if you want to set                                 up test spot for local testing Brandi                                 Faye has done a excellent screencast and                                 setting your best but anyway com I                                 definitely suggest people go look that                                 up                                 a couple of comments about the existing                                 infrastructure there's a lack of                                 flexibility which is not really peppers                                 fault the peppers built on project and                                 project is built on concept witnesses so                                 everything is hardcoded to release notes                                 right now which means we have no testing                                 for sand boxes or future branches or                                 initiative branches and that's that was                                 really the main driver we want to change                                 this that led us to start saying you                                 can't do it here easily maybe it's time                                 to death with a system we've got hard                                 coded test types so we've got branched                                 tests and patch tests and it's hard                                 coded that those are the keys of the way                                 that passed over to you and healed I'm                                 going to add a new test type after                                 adjusting that array the new photon q ay                                 yo and pulled on the test spot and you                                 put on Jeep about oracle you know                                 difficult to get report                                 way up to coordinate between all                                 components of this architecture and the                                 other issue that affects flexibility is                                 the entire systems regular directly                                 based groups I'll touch on that                                 so once again we got this high barrier                                 of entry which makes a good felt for new                                 people to come in and help out the                                 platform new maintained errs have this                                 very large learning curve they have to                                 look at and most make it about ten                                 percent up to that one driven to give up                                 and of course the test spots have                                 ultimately low profile until they break                                 so those that's sort of the background                                 of why we're looking at a new                                 infrastructure here the proposal that                                 we've got includes two projects one                                 called conduits and one or working the                                 architecture of this system is the same                                 as kipper and that we've got a scheduler                                 or a trigger point on drupal.org we've                                 got a central dispatcher which is the QA                                 google.org and we've got a test park or                                 a worker that actually execute the                                 testing                                 so what this condo at work a project                                 where it came from once again it was                                 written by Buddha power the bberry who                                 is the architect of the existing system                                 when he was told to back off and rupal                                 seven he went out and he said well let's                                 do a ground-up redesign take into                                 account all the communications of the                                 current system and let's let's do let's                                 do this again this is a third time his                                 third iteration of this process so we do                                 better to know whatever the patient so                                 we went away let the Drupal                                           cycle go and off on his own and he built                                 these two modules which and then release                                 them as the core up is with you driven                                 promposal fast right now there's a                                 little bit of backlash with the business                                 model that is associated with that but                                 talking to him at repairing Denver on                                 spring baking source code driven                                 so that it's now available for us around                                 and deploy what he built as the next                                 generation destiny constructor for                                 how it works the conduit server which is                                 the equivalent of you a deal in our                                 current environment posts just an                                 abstract structure of this two groups                                 and jobs so there is these groups which                                 loosely tied not using out across the                                 group about our objects and that project                                 contains a repo group contains branch                                 group it's an issue group catch boots so                                 you've got this tree stuff it's sort of                                 maps against the objects                                 and at each level of that tree could you                                 find it find different properties so at                                 the repository level will combine a                                 property that is the geturl composite                                 work throughout this presentation all                                 the talking all properties probably                                 important to know talking about                                 properties in the generic sense not in                                 object eral property it's a little                                 unfortunate that that's the terminology                                 we use because the properties actually                                 is a bone structure all right so jobs at                                 each level then inherit the properties                                 of each of that entire tree so when you                                 create a job at the bottom level or                                 that tree inherits the properties from                                 each of the groups above it now jobs can                                 also override any of those so if it's as                                 some flexibility we've got intelligent                                 defaults in the tree that the ability                                 override those properties for any job                                 types or move testing functionalities                                 and then to find their own properties                                 and values and validation so for example                                 Porter defines the review                                 now we don't want to hard-code any                                 assumptions of assistance and with what                                 we've got a pepper so we got this                                 structured array earnest structured                                 abstractfree but custom groups custom                                 trees custom dog schools                                 those are all individual groups so                                 that's just sort of the destruction on                                 drupal.org that mean that we also fight                                 em map inside                                 groups and jobs are separate so groups                                 can contain other groups or they can                                 continue but I'll talk a little bit                                 about job types so within a group in                                 order to kick off the test at Radio                                 a job note and the note type of that                                 note is what finds the actual job type                                 or or the actual test and functionality                                 other ones                                 when you create a node on QA do we code                                 creates a queue item puts it on to a                                 group of q is equal to                                              where it sits until a worker calls home                                 periodically pulls an item off of you                                 and have speaks to logic for that                                 so essentially this is a job dispatch                                 it's a custom job dispatcher system it's                                 got a little more complexities a lot of                                 junk about or specifics but at the root                                 root of it all it's done                                 so with this particular job dispatcher a                                 lot of people                                 why every play miss Jenkins but                                 Travis                                 some of the things that Jimmy built into                                 the system when first first going to                                 give us some objects that we couldn't do                                 with the existing so the first main                                 difference the fact that jobs are knows                                 the different if jobs are a role in a                                 database table buried somewhere so when                                 we have a problem with the test                                 we need to modify it or delete it that's                                 direct database information just not                                 so now with jobs as nodes we get all the                                 things that nodes bring us we get                                 revision support so nodes have revisions                                 and how jobs have religious visions have                                 history jobs now have history so we run                                 a test and retest it we can go back to                                 previous revision see the results of                                 that test you are debugging and                                 understand what it is that that may have                                 caused ability problem we also get a                                 user interface for preparations that                                 field api integration use integration                                 services integration so this is all                                 stuff that was customer code and confer                                 gift and now looking to leverage the                                 core capabilities of google for to                                 simplify the volume of custom tables                                 the other big benefit with jobs as nodes                                 there's no need to understand the                                 underlying DB structure in order to come                                 and build a custom functionality or to                                 build or to help troubleshoot tests or                                 work on tests so that broken test clean                                 up I no longer have to go into the radio                                 to need a local database or in some                                 cases actually going on to the database                                 in google.org until you the rope and my                                 request for ssh access to be able to do                                 that is an outstanding for six months                                 the other the next thing is we've got                                 services based communication                                         mark and see sort of bringing that up                                 into the next generation here using                                 services exchanging Jason objects                                 between qat over                                 the other thing services give us that we                                 doesn't that we don't have a concurrent                                 infrastructure is a version API now we                                 can start enhancing contestant                                 functionality but not right back control                                 the existing tests but they're sitting                                 he should be using a yo that people like                                 to go back with the pesto                                 we do we have stayed away from certain                                 enhancements has been greatly building                                 the test engine systems                                 so we're better positioned for more                                 future enhancements and third-party                                 integration using molten core standards                                 there's more water methods so the                                 neighbors are sleeping waking up at this                                 point                                 with this system we have the ability of                                 doing batch processing so we can take a                                 simple test job of                                                       up the individual into smaller chunks                                 and simultaneously send those chunks out                                 multiple test pots and process that job                                 in parallel so this has the potential to                                 greatly speed up some of our simple test                                 testing I say right now potential                                 because this week we have                                               when we have four we're gonna have to                                 scale up that side and construction                                 just the ability to have a bachelor's is                                 huge on top of that those results that                                 are coming back from that testing are                                 returned on a perch on basis so once the                                 first                                                                responds back there's a failure in those                                 first two hundred test you know as soon                                 as that chunks complete and there's no                                 need to wait for the other                                        testicle so that's a nice benefit                                 so I described how tests define this                                 array of properties again using the                                 generic term which can be overridden                                 pretty good jobs you've got this group                                 stretch for this nested group abstract                                 team structure which has intelligent                                 defaults but what we've done is removed                                 any of the hard-coded assumptions in                                 what's being passed as dogs each                                 property is itself an array so when you                                 tell a job here is the get URL I want                                 you to check out we can now check out                                 multiple yet check outs before running a                                 testicle when you tell the worker here's                                 the patch I want you two o'clock you can                                 now apply multiple patches for executing                                 we've also introduced a couple of                                 generic properties is a set of property                                 in a build property and what these are                                 our the ability to arbitrarily to run                                 arbitrary command execution drink and                                 rebuild and post weld cycle so if we                                 have a patch that's going to move all                                 Drupal into the poor directory we don't                                 have to create a                                                         a pre build step which is move all                                                                                                            with this you can execute a double you                                 get pulled down some libraries                                 dependencies that you might have on a                                 module write your own script you put it                                 via the patch execute that so it really                                 gives us full flexibility to do just                                 about anything                                 during the setup cycle or after the                                 build site both before you pick up                                 or whatever other contestants                                 so another item here the workers side of                                 this the test spot side of this the job                                 functionality the worker functionality                                 and testing functionality is defined as                                 c                                                                      you wanted to go                                                       had to sort through the seven layers of                                 directory structure find the right file                                 or the actual worker logic now if you                                 want to go do something on coder worker                                 plugin it's plug in the /border you can                                 write a ctools plugin you should be able                                 to write new testing functionalities all                                 the logic for the workers contain an                                 example now it's a little bit of                                 simplification there are a number of                                 pokes required on the conduits yo side                                 as we need to define a no type for that                                 job                                 the default properties I find the                                 validation logic we need to find the                                 field API structure and mapping of                                 results into the field apo structure but                                 none of this is nonsense                                 looking at the fingers crossed this                                 should give us a little bit or this                                 should simplify the ability for someone                                 come in out of the general community and                                 contribute to testing infrastructures                                 with a new test and functionality or                                 troubleshooting                                 so we have custom logic we have custom                                 properties we have built step command                                 execution we're really looking at a lot                                 more than just testing I position this                                 as more of a generic framework or                                 drupal.org automation                                 with that in mind we're doing things                                 looking at how can we use a spot from                                 you catch confidential when I upload a                                 patch let's have the automated testing                                 infrastructure go out find all other                                 patches that apply to that same and                                 apply them one by one and detect here's                                 the ones that need me rolls let's take                                 it one step further let's they kick off                                 another job that automatically faces                                 those or another job which will do                                 automatic back port side so Jimmy's been                                 quite active in trying to figure out                                 ways you can run different sets of git                                 commands and do some that rebasing some                                 exciting stuff                                 no Jim Jimmy unfortunately could not so                                 we're also looking at code quality                                 security reviews I've got a plugin for                                 the project application to you that goes                                 in and validates your branched games and                                 your tag names to make sure they can                                 play comply with info coding standards                                 it may sound like a really simple thing                                 but if you ever spent like five minutes                                 in the project application people would                                 be amazed at how often honey                                 so we are                                 supposed to wrap up and low happening                                 tonight                                 really quickly I'm throw up doing how                                 you build a new plugin this book install                                 need to create custom no type if you                                 look at the presentation online                                 actually click on the folder and look at                                 the actual told from example you've then                                 got pocus all fields with install                                 instance is to set up your field a guide                                 results display the default properties                                 and validate and then you've got hooked                                 on direct result which is the mapping of                                 the results that your customers equal                                 plug-in sent back to the field API                                 influence on                                 and then on worker you create CTools                                 plugging with Josh the logic so those                                 are the required steps that's what it                                 takes to create a new custom functions                                 some optional steps we've got hooks or                                 working with the two items as that'll be                                 put on the typical q object there's                                 hooks for a netbook to help initialize                                 some of API so we put place other values                                 like which chunk this result belongs to                                 increase in that the initialization hook                                 that properties alters on a job and                                 global basis and some other hooks for                                 executing other logic excuse me project                                 is John                                 so the existing plugins that we get out                                 of the box with the review-journal code                                 as we released it on do it execute is                                 our sample plugin functionality wise it                                 just execute whatever command you pass                                 it in your community of that property so                                 it's a it's a good simple project a good                                 one to look at for developing your own                                 as                                 and it's really intended as an example                                 route into something for actual use                                 because we also probably build steps in                                 there                                 Oh box to health                                 but conduits can which is a very simple                                 module that simply goes into the cheque                                 del repository and tries to identify a                                 list of all the best test cases it's                                 really good for seven and then                                 conduit plumber and these are not my                                 name's but initially in review driven                                 there was this concept we've had honda                                 plumber which one is infested water but                                 what conduit plumber is is tested it                                 goes out and execute honest and then                                 we've got fondue it coder to the code                                 which is fiscal people                                 have pepper lastly conduit coverage                                 which gives you both coverage results                                 for simple test esperance out of the box                                 some of the items that we're now looking                                 at developing and some of our future                                 thoughts and then should we get people                                 health check or evaluating your your

catch auto                                 rebasing conflict attempt detection                                 tomorrow i plan on spending an hour to                                 working with patrick without seeing and                                 trying to get to the code snipper                                 working on this new platform secure code                                 review performance testing info phpunit                                 you have made me the options are fairly                                 ms again all we need to do now is see                                 tools plugins that have logic that we                                 need and make sure that we've got things                                 like post                                 so next steps where are we and where are                                 we going really admit that I'm a giant                                 tease because we are going from here we                                 have a team it says here of one and a                                 half people working on this that's a                                 gross overestimation                                 Jimmy is dedicating his twenty percent                                 time at Google to troop of automated                                 testing infrastructure which is                                 fantastic I mentioned earlier I've got a                                 day job so I probably got about five                                 percent of my time I quick words this so                                 together we're approaching about a third                                 of the body and we desperately could use                                 some help working on this third getting                                 this deployment I think I think it's                                 fairly clear where the benefits are for                                 this but we want more people involved in                                 it so that we can actually make it more                                 maintainable by the entire community as                                 opposed to one or two people who happen                                 to fall into the roles like                                 so we do have project setup on                                 drupal.org there is the conduit project                                 and the workbook project there is also                                 cuando at drupal and worker drupal and                                 where those came from is that with with                                 you driven they had the generic                                 functionality generic framework and one                                 set of modules and then the drupal                                 specific enhancements in another                                 admittedly that makes it very difficult                                 we discover ability for it                                 to look at how do we really structure                                 this project                                 so this is this is the default that we                                 got it out of the review do we also have                                 our dev instances set up on google or so                                 we now have a conduit server that's                                 running and to test box                                 so we do have some development community                                 available development stuff ready for us                                 to work that happened just before I went                                 on vacation I haven't actually got                                 around to running tests on that you have                                 it now therefore                                 it's a little difficult in that the osu                                 or south park where there's all sorts of                                 jumping to all sorts of routine get                                 access to it just given the nature of                                 their                                 it is possible yet                                 and there's someone who wasn't out too                                 late last night and way too caught on                                 that I've had new items that slightly                                 the scheduler described from worker I                                 only talked about the dispatchers worker                                 we're at the architecture design stage                                 trying to figure out how best to                                 architect this and integrate                                 um we're looking for use cases what are                                 the other automation new spaces that we                                 use and some grime effective designs how                                 can we build a user interface for                                 triggering a new test type on                                 so with that drupal.org integration the                                 stuff we need is results displayed we                                 want to do we want to do something                                 similar to today where you can get                                 summarized results for the road detailed                                 results on the real servers and                                 interfaces i mentioned new use cases and                                 we're looking at how do we manage the                                 communication between group about org                                 and yosef to kick off a test we know we                                 need to create a node on the radio but                                 in the existing infrastructure we've got                                 this issue or but a number of database                                 tables are duplicated with let org and                                 rodeo so are as stable for example that                                 lists all the tests and so anytime you                                 got that beta duplication keep things in                                 sync when things get out of safe I mean                                 those two databases on two different                                 servers sbux are acting                                 and do things like execute a test for                                    minutes then decide they don't want to                                 execute again including it back up to                                 themselves in perpetuity                                 we want to avoid that data duplication                                 and one of the things we're looking at                                 which is little little abstract and                                 trying to sky right now is some concept                                 of a custom entity controller for the                                 more entities and                                 tie that root structure to the federal                                 projects and                                 unlike                                 and I mentioned we need to finalize our                                 do the work structure we do multiple                                 projects we whistle repository how do we                                 make this one we can go                                 and of course                                 they need a few words

these images unfortunately can also but                                 the different emails shall be totally                                 glad to reducing                                 and also the procession it's organizers                                 above it and I would do that                                 and with that                                 stunning designs                                 yeah please asleep                                 um like this                                 yes with the VCS property we support                                 drupal.org URL but we also support gift                                 projects you need some way of creating                                 an overview I do in order to talk the                                 test but I've services we have services                                 to do that and that version API helps us                                 prepare for the innovation so we're                                 setting it out for third-party                                 integration your new produce and review                                 driven itself and built as a project a                                 hundred percent or your custom use                                 support a Drupal but it supported your                                 own                                 it's really a infrastructure to service                                 for                                 so we do have technical support for that                                 how much of that we can build into our                                 organization probably still amazes                                 this is life                                 I know the security teams had concerns                                 having a super time                                 in situations like sand boxes of poor                                 that have parts                                 it would be very helpful to be able                                 not having to make it a project                                 yes so the existing infrastructure as I                                 mean everything is key to a release need                                 node ID so in order to get drupal org to                                 trigger a test over on QA infrastructure                                 you pass the node ID of the release to                                 QA do this does not work if you do not                                 have a release and routine will not                                 allow releases on sandboxes so the                                 current infrastructure doesn't support                                 that with the new infrastructure the way                                 you tell it to do a check out as you                                 pass it an actual                                 for URL so again I can be a Drupal or                                 get URL maybe a sandbox for the future                                 branch it can be a github URL the a it                                 can be other there's hold coming off the                                 topic excursion see yes get other VCS                                 types as well support for the                                 but yeah full support for San boxes will                                 support branches full support for                                 initiative                                 so far                                 sounds for Justin                                 think so                                 you might want to look at me                                 ilyas for that                                 necessarily fails but                                 so the default builds that in the                                 conduits order to compact with                                 three levels goes to just binary                                 pass/fail                                 we work our logic is completely                                 pluggable results display and whatever                                 project                                 on the note                                 so for example to get people check that                                 I mentioned                                 it sends back any if it finds an issue                                 in that you've got branch names that                                 hatched in packaging script that's a                                 minor issue it might get future man                                 we'll just glad if I by the way if you                                 want this this branch needs                                 if you have no branch means that                                 sniffle that's a critical now so we                                 played that as a triple and pass back                                 minor improvements                                 and then those get wrapped up into the                                 summary message passed up about                                 result the paternity                                 right so we                                 don't really have a level stuff                                 you do base it on here's a directory                                 there is it some there's enough is                                 enough                                 we've started running                                 but what we could potentially do                                 is build a dedicated pest part that does                                 have that demon running                                 as long as they can use services to pull                                 an item off a cube you can build custom                                 cue for those types of pests nature's in                                 the point is some potential people over                                 there but we don't have the box                                 question does remind me of another thing                                 that I did not mention is on the worker                                 itself there is a daemon runs in the                                 background testing its own sound so that                                 when jobs fail if the texts that it's                                 failed it sends it for a result and                                 making that happen something exceptional                                 got something in return despots and it                                 with that please fill in a session                                 evaluation and hopefully I've created a                                 little bit of exciting but similar                                 features this can do and purge the                                 couple people that on those days when                                 you're working to be a coroner's getting                                 fed up a little break more than happy to                                 welcome you over the New Testament                                 writers thank you very much for your                                 time and attention this morning and hope                                 to see some your inner peace
