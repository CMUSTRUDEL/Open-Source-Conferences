Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Move over PIFR, there's a new bot in town!
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	It's been nearly four years since the initial testing.drupal.org launch, and the introduction of automated QA testing into the Drupal.org environment. Since then, the testing infrastructure has chugged steadily along; quietly ignored, forgotten, and even abandoned for long stretches along the way. For the last four years, PIFT and PIFR have silently done their thing, putting up with more than their share of blame, abuse, and cursing when things went wrong..

But years of semi-neglect have taken their toll ... and while strategic use of duct tape and bailing twine might keep things running 'as-is' for a while longer, architectural limitations within the code mean that this dog is simply too old to learn any new tricks.

Enter the 'Conduit' and 'Worker' projects. Developed and fully released by Jimmy Berry (boombatower), these projects were written from the ground up to address the architectural limitations inherent in the existing PIFT/PIFR solution. Together, they provide a much more flexible and sustainable foundation for future testing infrastructure capabilities; as evidenced by a number of new features enabled by the platform on day one.

This session will:

Provide an introduction and overview of the Conduit/Worker architecture
Present a number of new testing infra capabilities enabled by the solution
Demonstrate extensibility of the platform and how to develop new testing plugins
Discuss how the solution improves long-term testing infra sustainability
Identify how anyone can help contribute to the improvement of Drupal's testing infrastructure
