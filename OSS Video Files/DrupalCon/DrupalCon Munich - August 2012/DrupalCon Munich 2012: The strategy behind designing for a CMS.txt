Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: The strategy behind designing for a CMS
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	I used to say: "There isn't a hard-to-theme design, only a lazy or bad themer". But after over 6 years working as designer, themer and now a CEO of a Drupal consulting company (Mogdesign.eu) I would probably change it to: "There isn't a hard-to-theme design, but some are easier and more cost-effective". I would like to share a few lessons and ideas from what I learned. What are those aspects that make your designs successful, easier to theme, cost effective, but still beautiful and meeting your client's needs. In other words - how to make both your themer and client fall in love with you:)

- How is print design different from web design
- Typography, grids
- Learn about Drupal, theme layers, elements, blocks, regions, etc...
- How to find balance between beauty and usability
- Be consistent: use same layout for views, blocks, headlines, font sizes, line heights, borders, margins, comments, images
- Design a style guide: a specific page with all often used HTML & Drupal elements, image sizes
+ more tips on becoming pixel perfect designer

The style guide example will be available to download

         order to begin I would like to share                                with you my story and what different                                experience I help with the design so                                since I was kid I was always around                                computers I was playing with them                                hacking be us and windows                                            remember that I got a note from a                                teacher because we had a computer class                                and the computer was so slow I tried to                                hack the beers and I screwed up some                                things of the teacher got angry but I                                became basically the guy that fixes                                computers for everyone in the family and                                it got actually so annoying that I                                wanted to start charge charging for                                phone calls which I got from my brother                                or father or whoever so then next to                                playing transport icon or age of empires                                are studied i discovered photoshop i was                                like hey I can do some photo                                manipulations I did a lot of retouching                                I really liked it and not sure if others                                liked it but I ended up actually                                designing posters and flyers for                                different event and I got my first real                                job with a printing company I worked                                there as a print designer designing a                                lot of packages for different products                                and eventually they asked me to design                                and build website for them so this was                                something new to me so I learned some                                HTML CSS and I put together something                                Dreamweaver so this was my very first                                experience with web and did around two                                thousand four I decided that this is                                something which I really like                                and I would like to do it for living so                                I dive deeper in this I build some                                websites on static websites for some                                friends or local companies and after                                some time it got in way annoying because                                they were always getting back to me ask                                for changes do this day I don't like                                this I need to change this text and I                                cannot do so I was thinking there must                                be something something where they could                                manage the website for himself so I                                found out about the CMS things was it                                was quite new for me at that time and I                                started to play with many different                                units like joomla type of three or more                                eggs and on the end I found some great                                article about how to build your first                                website in Drupal and basically they                                changed my life so I started around town                                when RuPaul                                                       actually came out just and a few years                                later months later I started to work                                with some US companies as a designer and                                 a femur and my first job wind one of the                                 those companies was tooo theme three                                 basically exactly the same sites they                                 just had different colors and you know                                 so i started working on the project in                                 the first one took me about hundred                                 hours to do that then the second was                                 about                                                                  getting somewhere and then I did the                                 last for about                                                        some progress and I was actually very                                 grateful that they didn't fire me after                                 the hundred a ver project because it was                                 certainly too long but it was great time                                 I was working with some very excellent                                 drupal developers who are many of them                                 are core contributors or the                                 created a tons of modules which we use                                 every day and i also got to the first                                 drupalcon it was in second and in                                 Washington we had our first Drupal                                 designers made up so that was wonderful                                 we spend like five hours just discussing                                 in Drupal and talking how we could make                                 it you know more nice because the one                                 thing which I heard a lot at that time                                 was that Drupal is ugly how many of you                                 have heard this phrase all right                                 sometimes yeah so um I knew that it's                                 not actually true I knew that it's not                                 about Drupal I knew that Drupal can be                                 used to build our many wonderful                                 websites so my usual answer to that was                                 no it's not repeal repeal is not ugly                                 but the femurs are not lazy and that was                                 including me maybe but anyways in                                      IBK i co-founded the mug design and I                                 became CEO in my responsibility shifted                                 from visual design into business                                 development I also do a lot of user                                 experience design and sometimes my                                 colleague let me also managed some                                 project so I gotta get another                                 perspective to design so the three                                 perspectives which I would like to talk                                 today are from a designer from a femur                                 and from a CEO what I i would like to                                 share some ideas and things which i                                 learned and things which i would like to                                 know when i started to design for for                                 drupal basically how to create a                                 successful design which is easy to theme                                 which is a cost-effective which is still                                 beautiful and it's meeting                                 clients need in other words basically                                 how to make everyone happy so I'd like                                 to start from a designer perspective                                 there will be several key points which                                 I'd like to mention first one is the                                 difference between print design and web                                 design many times actually it was my                                 experience also another design which we                                 hire later many many of us come from the                                 print design background and there are                                 several differences which which I'd like                                 to point out first of all first of that                                 is that the there is difference between                                 the print canvas basically in the screen                                 on which the web design is displayed the                                 size of the print canvas it's always the                                 same you have the exact dimensions of                                 newspaper or you have the poster or                                 flyer and you can look at it on in this                                 straight at home it always has the same                                 dimensions but when you design a website                                 it can be very different when you look                                 at it on a large monitor on small when                                 you look at it on tablet or on some                                 mobile device so we need to think about                                 this perspective how will my design look                                 on across multiple devices in there and                                 has there has been a great session about                                 this i believe yesterday i encourage you                                 to listen to their                                 another another difference is been for                                 print usually usually design with a                                     DPI which could be a problem if you                                 design here if you would design websites                                 with                                                                    just very very large and it would                                 improve affect the performance of the                                 website also you need to take care about                                 the image compression you need to save                                 the files for for the web and not you                                 know just as standard jpg and also                                 encourage you to learn about the                                 differences between jpg and PNG files                                 and I usually use JPEG when it's a lot                                 of colors and different shapes and when                                 it's less colors and or some                                 transparency needed always use PNG also                                 colors are different for print you                                 design with we call it sneak in Slovakia                                 but for web you design with RGB and many                                 times you design something on a monitor                                 and then you printed and you are scared                                 how it will look on in the real life                                 because the course make the color                                 profile the printer may be different or                                 whatever so you need to make sure that                                 you use the correct formats for for what                                 you are trying to achieve there are also                                 some other problematic elements or                                 things which might cause some issues and                                 it shadows gradients or rounded corners                                 or typography many of these things can                                 create some overhead when when actually                                 trying to theme there and I know that                                 with the crane new technologies might                                 not be as big problem or it's much more                                 flexible but it's still very good to                                 learn about what the limitations are                                 another                                 turns yes when you design a poster you                                 have to fool can watch behind you the                                 full space and you just placed the lemon                                 elements somewhere where it will look                                 good but when you design for a web you                                 need to be very precise about the                                 positioning of the elements you need in                                 the best way to do that is to use great                                 and marbled on who was a speaker at                                 drupalcon and he also spoke at several                                 drupal cons exactly about this problem                                 he has done a great work about it I                                 encourage you all to read about it and                                 learn about it if you are now using                                 grits you are miss probably in trouble                                 another thing which may cause problems                                 is interactivity you usually don't how                                 many many chances to use interactive                                 with interactivity when you design for                                 print maybe you can put there some QR                                 code or something like that but few                                 years ago it wasn't even possible but we                                 need design for a web then there are                                 suddenly many elements like you can have                                 animations you can help forums buttons                                 you can have different jquery effects                                 and the key the key is to know when and                                 how to use them and i will talk about                                 this a little bit later so this / the                                 difference is between print design and                                 web design i'd like to take some time                                 and talk about would I consider                                 successful design to me it is design                                 which where you set a goal and then you                                 meet the expectation and how many of you                                 are from Munich is there any one from                                 you ok so maybe you don't understand                                 this picture but it happened in Munich                                 and Sergio Ramos kick the penalty and                                 we weren't really high so okay since we                                 are in Munich I thought that this is a                                 good a good illustration how the goal is                                 not met so first thing is you always                                 have to think before you design many                                 times it happens even to me is like okay                                 when I hear the first for the first time                                 about the project I suddenly held this                                 image of this shiny website in my mind                                 and I am in a mood okay let's go I want                                 to design I don't want to do I don't                                 want to talk I don't want to listen I                                 just want to design i would put this                                 idea which i have in my mind on in the                                 computer and work on there but it's                                 really important that you take the time                                 and focus on what underneath not on the                                 picture in your mind always do the                                 research find out what is the most                                 important thing for the client find out                                 what is the core of his business learn                                 about what are the needs that he has                                 what is the what is the even the purpose                                 why he wants to design a website or why                                 he wants to make redesign what are the                                 things which are not working on the                                 current website and he wants to improve                                 in the new version also find out what is                                 the message that he wants to do khmer or                                 to bring what is who is the target group                                 is the website aimed for children is it                                 for men in between                                                     out what is the thing which will                                 eventually make the difference what will                                 make the conversion or the point when                                 for example the product is sold another                                 idea or advice is always designed for                                 users users are very interesting they                                 don't like to think they basically act                                 intuitively they can do page and they                                 click on the first                                 reasonable link which they find they're                                 also impatient if there is something                                 which is not working on the website if                                 there is something where for its not                                 working as they would like to work it if                                 or it takes it too long for them to find                                 the information that will leave they                                 also get very easily distracted and your                                 goal is a designer is to guide them and                                 help them keep their focus another thing                                 is they hate visual noise I call it a                                 digital cost refer be and I know that my                                 I actually am very affected with this                                 and I feel much better when there's a                                 lot of white noise a wet space in a                                 website it's not where it has colored                                 users like conventional patterns                                 basically they expect that the same task                                 which they perform on different websites                                 they will be able to execute on every                                 website if they login here they want to                                 look in here everywhere if they have the                                 navigation on top they want to have the                                 navigation on top everywhere so they are                                 sometimes users are like horses you know                                 they have the shelves on the eye or how                                 you call it and they just run one                                 direction which they hell in the last                                 advice which I would help for designer                                 from the design perspective yes think                                 about beauty versus usability many times                                 we think that the more awesome effects                                 the more hot new stuff we put it to the                                 website the more of somewhere it will be                                 but in fact it's in most of the cases                                 it's the exactly the opposite                                 for me there are basically two things                                 which I kind of consider the holy grail                                 of web design and that is a content is                                 the kink and keep keep it simple stupid                                 for me design is just supporting element                                 it helps users to focus on what is most                                 important and in web its information is                                 the content in our goal as a designer's                                 is to help them to find the shortest way                                 to the information or to the conversion                                 point and use design basically to                                 support the journey I'm not saying that                                 you shouldn't be following latest trends                                 or you shouldn't be trying out all the                                 hot new staff but you need to find way                                 how to use that to support the actual                                 user experience and one thing which we                                 worry often as a designers for like to                                 forget basically is there may be                                 ninety-nine percent of the actual                                 visitors are not designers they don't                                 care in fact if the website is in the                                 using the latest design trends they                                 don't care about the colors many times                                 about the latest cool funds they simply                                 want to find the information which bro                                 them to the website so i would encourage                                 you to learn about usability learn about                                 how to creating a wonderful user                                 experience and think about the visitor                                 and not as a designer so just a real                                 recap L go through it again paint design                                 versus versus web design what is the                                 successful design we need to design for                                 users and we need to                                 care more about usability rather than                                 about a beauty all right so I'm going to                                 talk now about the perspective of femur                                 what would I tell designer if I was a                                 femur there are several things one is                                 there's this ongoing discussion if                                 designers should be able to code his own                                 designs if he should learn the CSS HTML                                 and my answer to that is yes basically                                 design is only fifteen to twenty-five                                 percent of the whole project the                                 designers who would like to think that                                 design is the most important thing but                                 in fact there is this other                                           from which the project consists of and                                 in order for designs to be successful we                                 must understand what the other                                           I encourage you to learn about Drupal                                 build the site for yourself maybe you                                 can build your own portfolio there and I                                 try to understand what are the elements                                 of Drupal what is the theme what our                                 blogs will our region's learn about all                                 the new technologies that come out learn                                 about how mobile or response you or work                                 talk to developers talk to them and                                 fighting I'm sorry find out how they                                 actually use these new technologies and                                 how they actually deliver the project                                 how they how they operate on a                                 day-to-day basis and also get feedback                                 from them get feedback on design ask                                 them if this fancy new stuff which you                                 want to do if it's doable if you should                                 change it or if it's okay like this                                 to steal crude testing with one person a                                 one person or one user is hundred                                 hundred percent better than testing with                                 known and it's true the more feedback                                 you get the better your design can be                                 and if you learn all this it will help                                 you essentially do to put the elements                                 on the place where they naturally would                                 belong in Drupal which can make then                                 theming easier in many cases probably                                 the most common issue with designers                                 which iphone as a team ER was                                 inconsistency many times there is a for                                 example a block on homepage and then                                 there is the same block on a secondary                                 page and they look completely different                                 although it's the exactly the same                                 information it just looks different on                                 different places on the website or for                                 example just the blog title has                                 different font or different market                                 margin or border so if possible use the                                 same layout                                                         headlines font size line hints and all                                 the different elements also try to                                 design in a generic way for example                                 don't put two don't put same block in                                 two different side bars it's easier when                                 there is only one block and it's on the                                 same same place keep try to keep things                                 simple don't unnecessarily over                                 complicate your design another thing                                 which we need to think is content                                 navigation how will user get from point                                 A to B how will how will he get from                                 home page through some listing page to                                 the detail don't miss read more links                                 for example breadcrumbs also use                                 standardized layouts                                 grits I use nitrous                                                  columns I found that working best for me                                 also be consistent in image sizes many                                 times which is like that there is some                                 space okay I'll fill it with some image                                 and then on other place the same images                                 larger or it has a different shape and                                 it will be just much easier if they they                                 look the same and also I think for me as                                 a visitor it will be also better if                                 things look the same so the last advice                                 which I would give as a femur is clean                                 up your photoshop file if you look at                                 these two pictures you'll see that there                                 is a clear difference between the first                                 where all the layers just have some                                 random name they are organized as they                                 came there is no logical way how they                                 are around or grouped so always name the                                 layer always orange them in a way how                                 they appear in the design go from top to                                 bottom and by specific parts Heather                                 sidebar look in for example single node                                 also when you are designing with cs                                     CSX then maybe theme ours are having                                 some older version of Photoshop and if                                 you use too many groups nested groups                                 the file can actually be corrupted and                                 they might not be able to open it all it                                 will end up something similar like this                                 so to summarize learn how to code your                                 design be consistent and always clean up                                 after yourself                                 I'm getting to the third perspective                                 which is a from the point of view of CEO                                 of the company as a CEO there are                                 basically two things which which I am                                 interested in in the project I of course                                 want it to be successful I want the                                 client to be happy but I want that it                                 would be cost effective and I wonder it                                 would be delivered on time so okay all                                 right I'll jump the cost-effectiveness                                 first as I said design is fifteen to                                 twenty-five percent of the time but what                                 is important is that how the design will                                 affect the the actual length or the time                                 need to theme or to develop the website                                 two designs for example they may cost                                 the same amount of money but the                                 development can for one can be can take                                 double of the time if you make some                                 mistakes or if you do some things which                                 for example some of the things which I                                 mentioned earlier it can just add                                 overhead and can be just more expensive                                 so what are the factors which affect the                                 cost of design or theme it's everything                                 which I mentioned before plus several                                 others one is the first thing which we                                 started to do is we always design a                                 style guide for a project it's a page or                                 it's a Photoshop file where you have all                                 of the Drupal elements where you have                                 all the HTML elements and you design and                                 many times it's very easy to forget for                                 example to design tabs for content                                 editing or to miss out some details in                                 the footer or                                 there are many things which can be just                                 missed and if you have this kind of                                 design manual then themer exactly knows                                 what he should use and we're also what                                 we found out to be very effective is to                                 annotate the design with the kind of                                 post-it notes or descriptions where you                                 will describe what exactly which part of                                 the page is for for example there is a                                 there is a block with some some notes                                 some listing for example news you can                                 say that this is the news this it's                                 coming from you know it's a view view of                                 news content type or this is some slide                                 around the home page and it should be                                 using separate content type for it and                                 if you're not sure how exactly it should                                 work talk to developers or two per                                 signatures but this can speed up the                                 theming were much another advice is                                 designing only what is necessary many                                 times there are pages which basically                                 look the same they have the similar                                 information but for example it's just                                 different content type or it's different                                 category of the same content type and                                 you don't need to design all of the                                 pages just design what's what's                                 necessary also try to use real life                                 content unless if possible lorem ipsum                                 can sometimes be very risky because it                                 can look very nice but then also think                                 about what is required and what is                                 optional content because if you put                                 optional content everywhere and you fill                                 it and your design it looks very nice                                 but then in real life the users don't                                 fill this kind of information it can                                 suddenly just look very broken and                                 so keep this in mind and try to use real                                 life content when when it's just                                 possible also it's much easier for                                 client to imagine or do do accept design                                 if there is a real life content rather                                 than just some dummy images or text so                                 another thing which considers me the CEO                                 is delivering in time one thing which                                 helps is to define all of the                                 terminology in debate in the beginning                                 of the project try to find out exactly                                 which kind of labels for example you                                 should use for four different content                                 pieces what should the button say which                                 would be the read more for example link                                 also what what are the categories for                                 example of the content because many                                 times we design for example breadcrumbs                                 or some navigational hierarchy with some                                 very short category but for example                                 category can be for two lines and it                                 suddenly breaks up breaks the whole                                 design and if you define these kind of                                 things in in the beginning then you can                                 save a lot of overhead by coming back                                 and fixing in presenting and fixing                                 again okay always try to curate your                                 designs with a project manager or if                                 possible also with client get as much                                 feedback as you can but don't forget to                                 set some rules for feedback always set                                 rules for for example rounds of feedback                                 or runs of changes and don't leave the                                 project open-ended many times it happens                                 that we are getting close to                                 delivery and then we think we actually                                 finish the project we started design it                                 we start to theme it or develop it and                                 we find out oh we forgot to design this                                 specific content type or this specific                                 page where it looks just completely                                 different so always double check that                                 you have design everything because then                                 it can again cause some delays in                                 production or when working so cost                                 effectiveness and delivering on time                                 those are the two key things which I am                                 concerned about when I look at the                                 design process from the CEO of                                 perspective I also have some resources                                 which I which I some of them created and                                 some of them i have found there are                                 several Drupal elements or style guide                                 created for Drupal specifically and feel                                 free to get the links from the slides                                 slides already uploaded to the session                                 description h there are also modules                                 which basically will create you a page                                 with all of the HTML elements so we can                                 then theme them very easily and also                                 there is a video from la Drupal with the                                 title your design as a theme sucks and                                 it's also a great resource to understand                                 how teamers think and how it can be                                 beneficial from you to learn so thank                                 you very much for your time and I hope                                 that you have learned something and I                                 would like to ask you to fill the to                                 give me some feedback on the session and                                 I like to open up for some questions if                                 you have                                 yes                                 um okay yes so the question was as the                                 web is moving forward with responsive                                 design if I found it harder to design in                                 photoshop and I think that you are                                 asking if should be mobile first and                                 design in a browser and these kind of                                 things right okay to be honest there are                                 several or there are few cases where I                                 would be concerned about data and                                 especially if it's maybe a small project                                 and for example I used to design some of                                 the things in a browser even before the                                 responsive thing was there but because                                 it was just faster for me not to spend                                 some time on in Photoshop back just to                                 create the design in a browser but to be                                 honest I from the experience or from the                                 projects which we help right now we are                                 probably not there yet so I finally                                 better the design in photoshop for at                                 this point and this can change very very                                 soon even first I'm sorry we are we are                                 using compass                                 yes but many times it takes time to                                 shift the thinking of the whole company                                 you know and all of the processes which                                 are then tied to yes yes or the projects                                 which we help our for most of the                                 clients which we have mobile hasn't been                                 the number one reason or so yes                                 yes                                 yeah also we designed a mobile                                 application I would designed it in                                 photoshop and then tested it out in in                                 some phone or whatever and then came                                 back to change some things or some                                 elements yeah yes                                 functional                                 and then                                 we tried it on one project but we ended                                 up actually going back to wireframes and                                 design from them because it was a                                 project where we've been working with                                 some other company and they're well                                 basically building the design building                                 the website from the algebra wireframes                                 and we've been waiting for EM definition                                 to design and maybe it was from for time                                 reason we decided to go to work from                                 wireframes but i don't know i don't                                 really have a lot of experience with                                 this kind of approach                                 the other question
