Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Achieving Continuous Integration with Drupal
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Continuous Integration (CI) is a method of software development focused on
small pieces of work, integrated frequently, tested automatically, and
deployed regularly. Simple in concept, it requires a fair amount of effort
and infrastructure to set up and use. This session will describe how your
Drupal development team can achieve Continuous Integration, including:

* Using from a source code repository
* Automating the testing of every commit
* Testing in a clone of the production environment
* Making the current and prior versions easily accessible
* Providing visibility into all parts of the process
* Automating deployment of your site
* Measuring the results of changes you make for rapid iteration and
improvement
