Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: The Design of Everyday Things
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Things often don't work in accordance with users' expectations. There is often a mismatch between how we make things for people and how people intuitively perceive the world and the things in it. How often do you push a door that needs pulling to open? Or flick the wrong light switch? Amazingly it often takes a few minor improvements to remove these predicaments from our daily lives. The exact same things happen within our Drupal websites. But we tend to leave those 'flaws' in. In this session I will point out some of these issues, show some examples of 'bad design' and invite you to look at the things we make for everyday use from a different angle.

Session highlights
The bad design of everyday things
(Drupal) design fail examples
To err is human
Guidelines for making things usable
This session's theme is taken from the wonderful book by Donald Norman. Donald Norman is former Vice President of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple Computer and identifies many daily hickups in everyday use of things where people often blame themselves where the design is really error prone.

   that's about my background is user                                experience design interface design I                                work with Drupal since                                           involved in development interface                                development and Lotus Notes applications                                before that and Java applications and so                                then there's I got involved in project                                management team management and now i'm                                not into the technology so much as all                                the things around drupal so the title                                for my presentation is from this book                                the design of everyday things is written                                by Donald Norman the old and wise                                looking guy there on the right he's                                co-founder and principal of the Nielsen                                Norman group together with jakob nielsen                                the usability guy that you may have                                heard of and they do usability analysis                                and studies and they they sell the the                                findings and Bill Norman also was                                professor at several universities in the                                United States in the United Kingdom and                                he well got involved in behavioral                                studies and                                user analysis and such and i think it's                                i want to touch some themes in this book                                and i think it's a wonderful book that i                                think everyone involved in in product                                development and software development                                particularly should read there are some                                pretty good things in there the                                presentation is not so much about how to                                how to design things well the                                presentation just before this one had                                some wonderful points I mean there are                                many presentations and guidelines on on                                how to design things well but I sort of                                hope to invite you to look at the things                                that we all use on a daily basis a                                little bit differently and also the                                things that we make as as Google                                developers project managers as a team                                for ourselves basically within grupal                                but also for our clients in the websites                                that we make for our clients so I don't                                have many bullet lists I don't have many                                Drupal slides but I have someone great                                examples I think of well a design fails                                and even a touch base with Drupal of                                course so the bet design of everyday                                things one of the central themes in the                                book is that users often get blamed for                                doing things wrong or they blame                                themselves right and at crimson we have                                a professional support services and I I                                regularly see support issues that start                                with hey it must be me who is doing                                something wrong but can you please help                                me out here so Norman states if an error                                can occur somebody will make it and it's                                it's it's this theme that I I want to                                focus on this in this presentation                                technology changes rapidly people change                                slowly I think that one of the key                                points is that as new tech not new                                technology emerges as new software                                versions come out the people behind                                those the company's the the developers                                that make them                                forget the lessons of the past when it                                comes to putting the user first it's                                often driven by marketing departments                                that want stuff in there we want to put                                as many functionalities as as possible                                in there and we forget to to focus on on                                the user so i think that the people who                                are the wonderful developers that the                                even the Drupal community is rich of                                course they make wonderful                                functionalities it's it's great code it                                works well but there I think there are a                                lot of times they are ahead of their                                 users so here's a the Norman door it's a                                 it's a photo that it took from from                                 Donald Norman's website I don't know                                 where it's located exactly but how often                                 do you walk into a door that you are                                 supposed to pull and you push it or the                                 other way around right you just I had                                 this this morning even in this hotel and                                 you just slam into it and if you look                                 closely at this at the same door you see                                 a marvelous piece of work really some                                 designer really worked on a great                                 sticker with all the typographic things                                 at the left and it's it says in German                                 push and pull but as you can see                                 brickies slide in the glare of the Sun                                 it's hard to tell right so you just you                                 know it's a work of art and art doesn't                                 have to work it just has to be                                 appreciated right right so often with                                 some some small visual cues usability                                 improves drastically without getting up                                 true civ right so more doors here's a                                 photo that I took at the local                                 supermarket and I go there every                                 Saturday to do groceries and in Holland                                 from what I gather for my Belgian                                 colleagues and my English in-laws is                                 that we are we're sort of famous for our                                 dairy products                                 a lot of them a lot of sweet milk based                                 desserts and products and there's like                                 an aisle of                                                           cells with this stuff right and you know                                 the you have to open the door at the the                                 slightly embossed latch but it's hard to                                 tell the difference because the hinge                                 side is almost identical and you know I                                 don't have very long fingernails but I                                 am I often crack one when i try to open                                 the wrong side and I observe other                                 people doing that as well and there's                                 this obscure yellow note at the hinge                                 side so there's a space of about two                                 meters with a doorway leading to the                                 back of the store and then there's the                                 deep freezer cells and they put handles                                 there and the yellow notice at the                                 handle side and that one works right I                                 never design a building before I've seen                                 the site and met the people who will be                                 using it I think it's a great quote that                                 applies to us all to Frank Lloyd Wright                                 he was an American architect who                                 apparently worked on on a thousand                                 buildings and pleaded like                                              I took this photo from the building that                                 I I worked previously and it was it was                                 a cool building it was a it was actually                                 featured in some some design magazine                                 but the the array of buttons at the                                 front of the building they control all                                 the lights and there were exterior                                 lights and it had like an open floor you                                 could look up onto the first floor but                                 you couldn't see what lights you                                 switched off with every of the button so                                 what happened was is that the last one                                 to leave sometimes me sometimes others                                 but we would we would be coming into the                                 office the next day I like to still be                                 burning right where in fact you might                                 have turned on the lights because the                                 switches weren't marked so here's a                                 screenshot I'm sorry it's in touch but                                 tides of obviously the the publication                                 settings for for Drupal and we tend to                                 deliver our projects with handing out                                 information to our clients on adding                                 keywords                                 and some SEO stuff in there right and                                 what you see is that that our clients                                 tend to click on everything and they                                 fill out everything and then sometimes                                 things conflict or mix up or they you                                 know they are marked there's a clutter                                 there so okay different example here is                                 the remote control for a siemens                                 cartridge type AC unit square one in the                                 ceiling well in Holland we have hot days                                 we have cold days but we use the AC unit                                 daily right and we always had troubles                                 with the remote control by which it you                                 know since it was in the ceiling you                                 rely on the remote control and there are                                 several buttons on there but you know                                 the M swing of the a swing were the most                                 and big used ones to us so we actually                                 had a support engineer from Siemens come                                 in explaining to a small team what the                                 buttons did and you know obviously some                                 people were ill or I was out that day                                 and I missed that so you know for four                                 years when when it was installed we had                                 we had a fighting with the Siemens AC we                                 actually had a copy of part of the                                 manual that was lying around so people                                 could look it up anyway we used it daily                                 but we had we had a lot of struggle and                                 here is the tiny MCE editor with two                                 very similar buttons and we used this in                                 our projects and there was one                                 particular project for a client last                                 year that had a lot of content like                                 several thousand pages right there was                                 an informational site was very a                                 content-rich and what happened was is                                 that apparently the the website went to                                 production with like thousands of                                 staging URLs because the client had been                                 using the wrong button right and we tend                                 to blame the client but is it really the                                 clients fault anyway we make good                                 websites though                                 right so another example that I I took                                 this photo I had it from the internet                                 but we have these kinds of slight locks                                 and our parking lots when you get your                                 parking ticket and you can get back to                                 your car when you slide the car through                                 the lock right and no door opens but I                                 always tend tend to get the sort of icon                                 in the wrong way you know it's like the                                 the stereograms with with all the noise                                 and you have to look at it real long and                                 then I always see this in the reversed                                 way and I just I just can tune my head                                 to see the right way and i have this                                 with this as well and i always you know                                 there's happens wrong all the time we're                                 here is one from the citizen a motel                                 Schiphol Amsterdam and it says                                         commerce party people and which is after                                 midnight plays your card on the scanner                                 to enter you know and you get the card                                 that you get when I check in you just                                 have to hold it near the door opens this                                 it's it's easy you know it's it I think                                 it's a nicely designed with some witty                                 remark and it sits nice and works well                                 better at least right flight safety                                 instructions galore I took this from a                                 wonderful book that I have open here the                                 art of instructional design by the way I                                 have a resources sheet at the end it                                 contains all the books and the links and                                 the blog posts and links to the to                                 everything now that I am that I touch                                 here including some more so you don't                                 need to write it down but anyway the the                                 actual page is a flip out so it's twice                                 as big and what struck me is that with                                 each type of airplane times the types of                                 the number of airline companies there is                                 like some new design for the safety                                 instructions right so whenever there is                                 like the new                                                            that there is some designer who they go                                 up to and say okay here's here's another                                 fifty thousand and just you know I work                                 from scratch give us something new so                                 well I came here by flight                                 and what I see is that you know when the                                 stewards and stewardesses they they give                                 the instructions on how this works but                                 everybody opens left there are laptops                                 and their iPads right so anyway what                                 could what could go wrong in flight                                 right but here's another example it's                                 around about it's near my house and in                                 Holland there's a lot of texts euros                                 that go to infrastructure and I'm to be                                 honest I'm quite quite proud on how they                                 do that because everything is in the                                 right shape and in right order obviously                                 we have a tiny country so there's not                                 much to to maintain right but hear cars                                 have to yield so the cyclists go first                                 so the the triangles that you see over                                 there they indicate that the cars have                                 to stop in the cyclist go first and we                                 have a lot of bicycles in high in                                 Holland Holland is a bicycle country so                                 just a kilometer from there the cyclist                                 yield before the cars right and this                                 roundabout is governed by a small town                                 the next town so not the same and well                                 behind the bush is a pool I have a nine                                 year old who goes there on his bike from                                 time to time and up to be honest um I'm                                 worried and I'm amazed that nothing has                                 gone wrong and I hope nothing ever will                                 but there's there's a huge inconsistency                                 there I think in a basic system where                                 you interface with the world right and                                 user license agreements I when I got my                                 HTC Desire phone last year it came with                                 a Google premium navigation app and it                                 works quite well so when I when I first                                 started to work with with Crimson I had                                 a rental car and I didn't have sat-nav                                 didn't have a gps navigation so I was I                                 was relying on my phone to you were to                                 drive to Brussels and visit clients I                                 don't know the way in Brussels I can                                 imagine someone to us but                                 in any case I while I was driving on the                                 freeway                                                                  popped up and i had to go through all                                    pages of license agreement because it                                 has a very small screen right and then i                                 had to purchase a license with my credit                                 card can you imagine that so I was I was                                 relying on my you know a critical piece                                 of interface with the world and I was                                 sort of amazed that that they didn't                                 include some form of piece of                                 intelligence that that showed me this                                 after my dr right i believe it's a route                                                                                                     works quite well and this is the feeling                                 that I get from from such you know it's                                 the the white tiles the ribbon tiles are                                 for blind people with the white cane I'm                                 not trying to make fun with my people of                                 course but um there's a there's a                                 different type of ribbon when they have                                 to cross but at somebody in his in his                                 right mind put a stone there so anyway                                 this is end-user license agreements for                                 me and have another remarkable image                                 blah so you know who who has actually                                 read the the update for the license                                 agreement on your iPad or iPhone when it                                 came out all back to back off                                          who read those raised hands no that's                                 what I thought and hoped you know I'm                                 confronted with end-user license                                 agreement daily we have one in the in                                 the hotel when we when we use internet                                 and it's I mean it's great internet as                                 fast as cheap but everybody clicks it                                 away right it's like a pop-up and I'm                                 looking for the button don't bother me                                 again next and there's people around me                                 you know I'm computer savvy I like to                                 think so but there's people around me go                                 don't even read the important pop-ups                                 right so I'm not saying that that end                                 user license agreement there are I mean                                 there                                 that they are not important they're an                                 important part of you know the things                                 that we do suffer that we make they they                                 belong with that but there was a great                                 example that I am that I once found I                                 couldn't find it in time of the                                 presentation but or I couldn't find it                                 back but it said well we need to to                                 offer you the license agreement you're                                 not going to read it anyway so click                                 here but if you want click here so                                 Drupal um right so Drupal did a there                                 was a usability study for Drupal early                                 on this year in February I was held at                                 Google and they took eight technology                                 savvy people from google and as                                 usability studies go they have like this                                 usability script that they pose to                                 people and they asking questions and                                 task to do and then they observe them                                 and it was recorded so what they did is                                 they they put some essential Drupal                                 functionalities to the test including                                 content creation interfaces like views                                 and styles and such so when you go to                                 the URL the report is there the findings                                 are there that there is even a detailed                                 report and there's a breakdown into                                 issues that you can help work out with                                 so i think that's that's a great thing                                 how to do that I don't want one to get                                 into that into the details now but I do                                 want to go over the the findings real                                 real briefly so what they what they                                 concluded was that a new user feels                                 confused and overwhelmed by drupal's                                 presentation of features and options                                 alienated by unexplained to terminology                                 throughout drupal helpless because of a                                 perceived lack of support in the dark                                 about the extent of drupal's                                 capabilities and uncertain about her his                                 or her progress while performing tasks                                 as stupid because they assumed they are                                 drooping using drupal incorrectly which                                 was one of the central themes that I                                 started out with so from from Jesus                                 keynote yesterday I saw some remarkable                                 things on what they did with usability                                 so                                 obviously a lot of things are happening                                 and are improving anyway so I wanted to                                 to to show you this that all the                                 examples and all the fun things that I                                 that I showed just now they also happen                                 in Drupal so Norman states if an error                                 can occur somebody will make it there                                 are a few principles on you know why                                 people make these mistakes and I wanted                                 to to touch with those briefly so these                                 t-shirts were tested on animals they                                 didn't fit I think this is a great is a                                 great slide that will work that will                                 work in almost any case but a common                                 mistake that people make when trying to                                 design something completely foolproof is                                 to Honduras underestimate the ingenuity                                 of complete fools says douglas adams                                 he's the writer for The Hitchhiker's                                 Guide to the galaxy right and this is                                 about users don't always make the best                                 choices they don't always use the                                 quickest way to find information and                                 they don't read web pages in a linear                                 fashion right and I've seen both clients                                 as well as as the people around me                                 looking for things that were just like                                 screaming to their faces like a big                                 button at the top and they're missing                                 that right so instead users they a                                 satisfies which is a term i believe                                 coined by steve cook the author for i                                 don't mean anything it's a great book i                                 must read as well so it's a combination                                 of that they try to find whatever is                                 whatever satisfies this and suffice is                                 so whenever they see something that                                 might remotely hold what they're looking                                 for they click right it's an important                                 thing to take into mind another thing is                                 use metaphors and words and you know                                 there's this is a photo of a                                 box from cool blue it's a hardware                                 retail shop that we have in Belgium and                                 the Netherlands and they cells to all                                 sorts of things of laptops and razors                                 and tablets and dishwashers i believe                                 and i love the way how they handle the                                 entire process from ordering to to                                 delivering your package I to returning                                 it when when something is wrong yeah I                                 like the thing what they did with the                                 icons like you can use a blowtorch to                                 open you can use an axe you can use a                                 soil but you can use a knife and you can                                 use scissors but you know when using                                 icons are the thing is you know when                                 you're relying on on metaphors people                                 may not understand it or worse they make                                 it they may take it too literally and                                 I've seen people opening up such                                 packages with it a knife screwing up                                 screwing up their contents right so the                                 case that I want to make is metaphors                                 and words work best there's no intuitive                                 interface not even the nipple it's all                                 learned so when i submitted my my                                 session on the drupalcon website i                                 stated things don't often don't work                                 intuitively right and there's often a                                 mismatch between how things are made and                                 how things how we perceive things                                 intuitively in the world and the thing                                 is that users follow their intuition                                 based on past experiences right they                                 employ metaphors that are consistent                                 with what they have already learned but                                 the thing is they have to be wrong you                                 know there are misconceptions there                                 there's only half truths so you know I                                 would make the case that there there                                 cannot be an intuitive interface you                                 know and you will run into the there's                                 there's a lot of ambitious people out                                 there designers who will make the case                                 that your interface should not require                                 an in learning on the part of the user                                 right and i think that's not possible                                 so that's when you bring out the nipple                                 remark okay so how we really use the web                                 this is from that made me think Steve                                 crook that I mentioned earlier and I                                 think it's a great slide on you know the                                 difference between how we how often                                 things are designed in certain way even                                 you know applications in a very linear                                 fashion your clients also think in a                                 very linear fashion we want to put up                                 this first and then this and use this I                                 tracing software to find out you know                                 how how users really use the web and                                 this was really not an eye opener when I                                 when I first in her first holidays so                                 short sum up poor usability results in                                 anger and frustration which is what I                                 what I had when using my google                                 navigation decreased productivity in the                                 workplace higher error rates physical                                 and emotional injury one of the cases                                 that that Donald Norman is expanding                                 about is he got involved in the in an                                 exit in the study after the accident                                 with a nuclear power plant in the United                                 States and I showed you the the example                                 of the the roundabouts and well I hope                                 that there that there won't be some                                 physical injury there but it can                                 equipment damage loss of customer                                 loyalty so I I I spoke to to Steve parks                                 the other day and he did a great job of                                 of actually winning back a client that                                 was so done with Drupal after two                                 apparently projects that went totally                                 amiss because of you know the the client                                 struggling with with the way it was                                 constructed and it costs money so if you                                 go to to Donald Norman's website and the                                 link is in the resources slide he has                                 some there are many                                 usability studies really but there are                                 some that that actually have made                                 calculations on you know the the minutes                                 and seconds lost especially you know on                                 in online applications and relatively                                 large organizations the time that is                                 lost you know because of poor usability                                 and cost money okay so I didn't want you                                 to leave out some at least some                                 guidelines and some you know help on on                                 how to to improve things that we make                                 and I think it's important to to to                                 stress that I don't believe it's just a                                 the designers responsibility so I'm a                                 I've used the term design a lot but                                 there are some as I said many there are                                 many Drupal developers many of you who                                 create functionalities that are ready to                                 plug in that we use that we employ in                                 helping our clients and you guys also                                 make the interfaces you also you guys                                 also create on you know how that works                                 how we need to operate it so this I                                 think it's important for everyone to to                                 consider that you know making things                                 usable is a task for all of us as a team                                 but also individually Dilbert                                 engineering uh is there anyone who                                 doesn't know this slide okay good so we                                 have it in our office wall I think it's                                 a great illustration on you know the                                 difference between you know how we make                                 things and how well speaks for itself I                                 want to get into the psychology of of                                 user usability a little bit by am                                 explain a little bit about design models                                 and user models also known as conceptual                                 models and mental models and it's all                                 about knowing your user and managing his                                 expectations                                 so a conceptual model is how you think                                 it up how you make it right and user                                 model is basically how the user                                 perceives the things that we make the                                 things that you make you know and                                 designers often and developers as well                                 don't often don't speak with end-users                                 and you know as a result you have sub                                 optimal implementations about sub                                 optimal products and when you don't                                 think of a proper user model when you                                 don't consider your user and how you                                 will perceive the thing that you will be                                 making it users are forced to make up                                 their own user model right and as I                                 stated they're there they're prone to be                                 wrong because there are based on                                 misconceptions incomplete facts facts                                 experiences with other things so i think                                 the the design model and user model arc                                 is a critical component into into any                                 software development into any module                                 development everything that we that we                                 make here still you may be thinking well                                 you know what of it what is what has                                 that to do with me and I think it's                                 cheaper for a reason it's it's all about                                 the misconceptions between the you know                                 the difference between what your user                                 expects and what you create for him                                 right so when there is there is a                                 difference between the conceptual model                                 and the mental model your users will                                 find your your module your website your                                 own application hard to learn and hard                                 to use right often I think that that you                                 know we we will force the way how we                                 make things the conceptual model on to                                 your users and you need to change what's                                 in the head of your users you want to                                 adapt the users mental model onto your                                 conceptual model which is which is                                 training and which is basically what                                 training should be all about so                                 providing feedback is critical it's very                                 important to                                 to let let let know what's happening                                 otherwise people sent their prints like                                 eight times they turn their computer off                                 and on and it to be honest it took me                                 quite a while to find out that the OSX                                 finder is only done searching when the                                 title reverts back to the to the folder                                 where you're at right and I I will                                 imagine that there are many people who                                 will be having this question but so                                 provide feedback is important provide                                 constraints this is a snapshot of the                                 ticketing machine at the Dutch railways                                 at every railway station we have                                 ticketing machines with this this system                                 on and i think it's a it's great it's                                 clean and it's it has very clear                                 constraints so you have to go from left                                 to right and at the end you will have to                                 pay if you forget a step or skip one or                                 do something wrong they have very visual                                 clues very clear very constraint                                 affordances affordances is all about how                                 do i go about using this thing there's                                 many more in donald Norman's book about                                 this but remember the weight in grupal                                 where you have to put in the weight                                 obviously to to change the order and i                                 actually had clients asking say ok if i                                 put in like minus                                                       does it seem down right and affordances                                 is where you make visually clear how it                                 works right so now we have like we can                                 we can slide things up and down which is                                 a great way to to improve based on                                 affordances the trunk test I think is a                                 great tool it's also on our on our                                 office wall sold this is from Steve                                 crook don't make me think as well and                                 it's about you getting into a trunk                                 blindfolded taken out blindfold off and                                 you have to tell like in seconds where                                 you're at right so the importance of                                 good questions that you will have                                 be able to answer in like seconds is                                 what website is this the site idea what                                 page mi on what are the major sections                                 of this website or primary navigation                                 what are my options at this level                                 secondary navigation where am I in the                                 scheme of things the breadcrumbs and how                                 can i search it's a great tool when I                                 suggest that that you're taken to take                                 this into account with with all your                                 designers and developers and hang it on                                 there on the on the office wall Jonathan                                 IV is a senior vice president industrial                                 design at Apple Inc and you design the                                 the iphone in the imac and the ibook so                                 well you probably have heard about him                                 there is a great interview in The Daily                                 Telegraph and he says it's the finishing                                 the back of the drawer you can argue                                 that people will never see it and it's                                 very hard to describe why it's important                                 but it just seems important it's a way                                 that you've demonstrated you care for                                 the people that you're making these                                 products for and I think we see                                 ourselves as having a civic                                 responsibility to do that it's important                                 it's right but it's very hard to explain                                 why so another snapshot of my favorite                                 box so this is so fun cool blue again                                 and at the bottom they they have this                                 nice little thing that says ingredients                                 wood pulp papers on Pantone colors air                                 bubble back some special skills a lot of                                 love and of course your order now this                                 is a physical product right and we're                                 we're all in the business of making                                 software but I think that this applies                                 as much to the things that we make in in                                 our you know daily modules in our                                 software as it does in in products and                                 in fact at crimson we have a physical                                 box that we hand out to clients and it                                 has some some important documents in a                                 sign of document and some goodies in a                                 book and it serves as a milestone for                                 clients say okay we're done for you                                 project it finished and another phase                                 this report phase starts here here's a                                 snapshot of the website so one of the                                 great things that I think they                                 did is that at the top it states you                                 have eight hours and                                               ensure delivery tomorrow and you know                                 when I I don't know about you but when I                                 order something from the internet I want                                 it fast you know it's nice to have to                                 receive real meal to receive packages                                 and open it up right so but it's also a                                 great incentive to you know to order now                                 so I know when it's going to get there                                 but it also urges me to to make that                                 purchase yeah so I think that's a nice                                 little detail that they there are many                                 more but um anyway so another thing how                                 many is there anyone who knows how to do                                 the copyright symbol or Mac how do you                                 do that how do you do the copyright                                 symbol on Mac how do you type that yeah                                 it's option G anyway I have to look it                                 up all the time and same thing with the                                 Euro sign it's even harder for us I                                 believe in Windows it's like all                                        for the copyright but anyway you know                                 this is this is they're not doing                                 everything right adapt ok so I'm going                                 quite fast but I'm almost true I wanted                                 to show you a very short video reel of                                 Guy Kawasaki and he was a he wrote a                                 book called enchantment and the art of                                 start and it was also involved at the                                 the technology division at apple and                                 he's he's giving a lecture to two people                                 setting up a company so he's a he's                                 talking to young entrepreneurs but i                                 think the the things that he says apply                                 as much to all of us working in our                                 company's i'm working for our clients                                 because we're all basically in that                                 business so I'm gonna see if I can't get                                 that started                                 the first thing I figured out and learns                                 sometimes the hard way about                                 entrepreneurship is that the core the                                 essence of entrepreneurship is about                                 making meaning many many people start                                 companies to make money the quick flip                                 the dot-com phenomena and I have noticed                                 in both the companies that I've started                                 and funded and been associated with that                                 those companies that are fundamentally                                 founded to change the world to make the                                 world a better place to make meaning are                                 the companies that make a difference                                 they are the companies to succeed my                                 naive and romantic belief is that if you                                 make meaning you'll probably make money                                 but if you set out to make money you                                 will probably not make meaning and you                                 won't make money so my first thought is                                 you need to make meaning that should be                                 the core of why you start a company                                 there are three ways to make meaning                                 first is to increase the quality of life                                 my background is a Macintosh division of                                 Apple computer then I can tell you the                                 total certainty that we were not                                 motivated by making money we were                                 motivated by changing the world to make                                 people more creative and more productive                                 we were trying to increase the quality                                 of life for the macintosh user and that                                 was a great motivation it kept us going                                 through many many difficult periods we                                 were waking up in the morning thinking                                 how we could change people's lives a                                 second way to make meaning is to write a                                 raw you know that this fish is going to                                 die after jumping out but to write a raw                                 means that you find something that's                                 wrong in the world or you notice                                 something's wrong or you want to fix                                 that this might be particularly                                 applicable to not-for-profits where you                                 know there's pollution or there's crime                                 or there's abuse and they just their                                 very core is to end that wrong and the                                 third way to make meaning is to prevent                                 the end of something good as you see                                 something beautiful something wonderful                                 and you just can't stand the fact that                                 it's been eroded its being changed its                                 being ruined so I ask you as you start                                 your company's you're not for profits                                 your churches your school's whatever                                 you're starting please have one of those                                 three motivations one or more of those                                 motivations if you don't have any of                                 those motivations                                 I suggest that you rethink what you're                                 doing I think these three things are the                                 key to starting a great organization                                 right so this is this is really around                                 up to the principles of design thinking                                 I think it's important that you know                                 your users and you align with your users                                 mental models and as I stated just now                                 it don't think that's just just a thing                                 for designers but for all of us for                                 designers and developers alike and                                 product owners and everyone involved to                                 to know your user know what goes on in                                 their heads and to what to look at the                                 things that you make for them from their                                 end primarily you know developers                                 designers you developers also use coffee                                 machines and dishwashers and vacuum                                 cleaners you don't want                                               your vacuum cleaner just to provide so                                 many functions on there right just one                                 like three switches at most provide                                 appropriate feedback and everything that                                 we make let let let the user know what's                                 happening eliminate the opportunity for                                 error as much as you can right and all                                 things you make will have to make                                 meaning so this is the resources slide                                 it's on SlideShare or tears
