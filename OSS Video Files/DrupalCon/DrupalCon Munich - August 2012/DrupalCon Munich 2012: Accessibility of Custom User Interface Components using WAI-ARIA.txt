Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Accessibility of Custom User Interface Components using WAI-ARIA
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Web markup languages provide toolboxes of user interface components to be used to enable the development of web applications. However, there are many cases when design specifications require the use of custom components that are not available natively in the toolbox. Developers must then build custom components.

Custom components are built using markup for structure, Javascript to enable behavior and CSS to communicate look, feel, and meaning to users. Using style alone to communicate the meaning (role and purpose) of a user interface component is one of the biggest barriers to building accessible web applications.

The WAI-ARIA recommendation "provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications" ( http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/ ).

	                              alright so i guess i will start my name                               is Everett zoo felt oh hello all right                               my name is Everett zoo felt I'm a Drupal                               core accessibility maintainer I an                               invited expert to the HTML working group                               at the w                                                               lead and tech lead at my planet digital                               in toronto we're good on the slides                               great wonderful thanks so what do those                                three things mean i guess is where I                                want to start as the accessibility                                maintainer for Drupal core I monitor the                                issue queue for issues the Drupal core                                issue queue not so much contributed                                projects for issues that are tagged                                either accessibility meaning that the                                issues related directly to accessibility                                or needs accessibility review meaning                                maybe somebody's thinking about changing                                the UI or introducing a new UI component                                and they'd like a little bit of help                                understanding of the changes that                                they're making are going to be                                accessible or create any accessibility                                regressions in the product I haven't                                done much work with the HTML working                                group recently but when I was more                                active in the working group what I was                                doing is reviewing the html                                 specification this is the w                                          not the what WG version to make sure                                that there's nothing in the                                specification that would cause problems                                with accessibility and to make sure that                                the specification has everything that we                                need to ensure a richly accessible                                experience for the new web and then at                                my planet digital I give some                                organizational oversight to                                accessibility as long as some technical                                guidance or or assistance on one of the                                scrum development teams I don't have the                                elevator pitch for my plan that digital                                memorized it's a user experience company                                that builds websites primarily using                                Drupal but also using a number of other                                technologies depending on client's needs                                so what I want to talk about today I've                                done some accessibility presentations in                                the past at different Drupal related                                events and normally its introduction to                                accessibility or sometimes advanced                                accessibility how to look at you know                                the guidelines to understand guidelines                                some of the automated tools that you can                                use to assess your site that's not what                                we're going to talk about today though                                if somebody's interested in having that                                discussion we can set up a bof maybe                                tomorrow and we can have that discussion                                as a group what we're going to talk                                about today is how to ensure that custom                                user interface components are accessible                                to people with disabilities and so this                                kind of the subtitle of my presentation                                I think is a span is not a slider and a                                div is not a button and that's from that                                I mean that's kind of the from the                                technical perspective there's a human                                perspective about user interface                                accessibility in the same way that                                there's a user perspective about                                usability and we'll touch on those                                concepts as well but really looking at                                the why aria recommendation from the w                                  and how it can help web authors design                                components and design user interfaces                                that work for the broadest possible                                range of users and then why aria just to                                break that down that stands for the web                                accessibility initiative that the why                                part that an initiative of the w                                       stands for accessible rich Internet                                applications so we have lots of Ria's                                out there in the world Google Docs yahoo                                mail all sorts of rich Internet                                applications we want to make sure that                                they are accessible to all users I                                thought I just touch base Morton did a                                presentation on theming earlier which                                was excellent he and I think and I                                wanted to touch base because this came                                up in my mind while he was talking he                                was talking that there are developers                                who build stuff and there's designers                                who create stuff and in the middle there                                are themes that have to try to marry                                those two things together a lot of talk                                about accessibility and this is all                                 semantics but I guess that's what the                                 web is                                 comes down to really the paradigm of an                                 accessibility enhancement how can we                                 make this broken thing accessible and                                 when we're talking about enhancing a UI                                 it oftentimes falls to the theme layer                                 to bring those enhancements to the user                                 we need to stop doing that in Drupal and                                 what we need to do is talk about having                                 real semantics on the back end coupled                                 with the data that can be that can                                 represent what that data is on the theme                                 layer if it's a list if it's a toolbar                                 if it's a slider we need the semantics                                 on the backend that represents that and                                 then we can allow the theme errs to                                 marry the design with those semantics to                                 give the visual presentation and the                                 interaction that that bet the dot that                                 design design informs so I want this to                                 be an interactive session that was kind                                 of my initial blurb and I've got more                                 slides and lots of content and and some                                 fresh content that I came up with today                                 because I did a really really fast you                                 know inaccurate review of some of the                                 spark stuff that was being presented and                                 discussed throughout the day yesterday                                 and but I want this to be an interactive                                 session pls interrupt me don't put up                                 your hand that's not going to work for                                 anybody who's not aware i always forget                                 this part i'm completely blind so the                                 putting up your hand part that doesn't                                 work at all just yell out and interrupt                                 me if there's something that you'd like                                 me to clarify or stop I know all of this                                 information and you don't and so if I                                 skip over a point and you're like I                                 still don't get that interrupt me and                                 we'll spend a little bit more time                                 making sure that everybody is up to                                 speed and that everybody understands                                 what I'm talking about so so what is a                                 user interface component so let's maybe                                 just the user interface component is a                                 piece kind of an encapsulated piece of                                 user interface these are the building                                 blocks these are the things that you                                 would maybe find in a toolkit like Yui                                 jquery dojo these are the pieces that                                 you can put together to build a user                                 interface we're talking buttons                                 inners lighters progress bars these are                                 user interface components most well we                                 won't say most there is really a single                                 common markup language for the web and                                 that's HTML there's HTML                                                 then there's html                                                        semantic good components in HTML                                   there's a button and a select box and                                 you know a checkbox radio button yet you                                 could probably name them on you know                                 less than two hands there are not a lot                                 of components in HTML                                                 done as web developers when we get a                                 design handed to us or when we get a                                 user flow handed to us that has a                                 progress bar and a slider and a tabbed                                 interface and a tree grid and all these                                 things is we fake it we fake it with                                 some meaningless divs and spans that                                 have no semantics we faked it with CSS                                 to make it look the way it's supposed to                                 look and JavaScript to bring the                                 behavior in behind the scenes but those                                 things that we're building and                                 integrating into our applications those                                 user interface components they don't                                 actually exist they really don't we're                                 pretending that they exist by building                                 them the way that we do so what common                                 components aren't available i discussed                                 some of them in now in html                                       changes and now browser support may vary                                 but in html                                                           some new rich semantic elements I'm not                                 going to go through them all but I mean                                 we have things like a menu now we have                                 things well we have menu items we have                                 toolbars we we have more semantic                                 elements we actually have an html                                     the spec though I suspect there's been                                 zero implementation of this at all we                                 actually have a dialogue element now in                                 the spec which allows content authors                                 really web application designers to use                                 a dialog a modal dialogues on one of                                 those light boxes that pops up over the                                 screen and trust that user agents are                                 going to perform some of the heavy                                 lifting some of the functionality and                                 and probably some light default theming                                 for that                                 now that being said a lot of these                                 exciting new pieces don't work yet they                                 don't they haven't been implemented some                                 of the ones that haven't been                                 implemented or that have inconsistent                                 implementation do have some polyfill                                 support by different libraries but we're                                 really talking about the future we're                                 not we're not talking about all of these                                 things are not things that we can                                 achieve today with native semantics from                                 the markup language that we're using so                                 that's a background that's that's an                                 understanding of what we have we have                                 some components that existed in HTML for                                 that that work everywhere we have some                                 components that exist in html                                            a little bit in some places and not at                                 all in others and then for the rest of                                 the things that we need to do which is                                 most of what we need to do daily we fake                                 it by building these these non semantic                                 JSC SS user experiences that don't                                 actually map to any native semantics so                                 why is that a problem why does it matter                                 that you have a div and                                                 that build your slider or your progress                                 bar and that you're you know just using                                 some CSS to make that look the way you                                 want it to look we need to understand                                 how assistive technology and for the                                 purposes of this discussion we're let's                                 we're really going to focus on three                                 three personas but there are many many                                 more but in order to keep it simple                                 we're going to focus on the person who                                 has no apparent disability somebody who                                 can see the screen use a keyboard use a                                 mouse they're fine then there's going to                                 be the keyboard only user this is                                 somebody who has really no no limitation                                 except they can't really use a pointing                                 device or they choose not to or they're                                 on a device that doesn't have a pointing                                 device and so they have to interact with                                 your content with your site using using                                 only the keyboard then we're going to                                 talk about a third group of users which                                 are screen reader users like myself                                 these are users who use the keyboard                                 don't                                 generally use a pointing device though                                 most screen readers have a horrible                                 clunky system of faking using a pointing                                 device when you absolutely need to and                                 screen or do users who there is a                                 barrier between a technological barrier                                 between a screen reader user and your                                 content and that barrier is the screen                                 reader so when I'm on a web page if I                                 start typing if I start pressing keys                                 those key strokes are not going to the                                 browser they're not going to chrome and                                 they're not going to Firefox they're not                                 going to Internet Explorer first they're                                 going to my screen reader my screen                                 reader is going to make a decision about                                 what to do with that key stroke is it                                 going to process it is it going to                                 capture it and do nothing with it or is                                 it going to let that keystroke pass                                 straight through to the browser so that                                 your javascript where the browser chrome                                 we can do something with the keystroke                                 and that can becomes really important                                 because when we're talking about some of                                 these more rich user interface                                 components we're talking about                                 components where you were defining some                                 behavior that and a lot of the time that                                 behavior is based on keyboard behavior                                 and what we need to understand is that                                 if you're if you're saying if somebody                                 hits the letter H you know pop up this                                 help dialog a screen reader user when I                                 hit the letter H I'm going to jump to                                 the next heading on your web page and                                 and your javascript is going to have no                                 idea that i press to the letter h at all                                 so i think most people here are familiar                                 with markup that's HTML that's the stuff                                 that gets up downloaded by the browser                                 from your server so we won't go into                                 that probably most people if not                                 everybody here is familiar with the Dom                                 this is what happens once the document                                 is downloaded by the browser and gets                                 parsed and it goes into kind of a well                                 to the document object model it gets                                 parsed into a tree that the that the                                 browser now knows how to interact with                                 and how to render and how to attach                                 behaviors to the part that most of us                                 probably haven't had experience with is                                 what's called an accessibility API                                 and boy would my life would all of our                                 lives be easier if there was an                                 accessibility API there is not there is                                 Microsoft that has to Firefox has one OS                                 X has its own so there's msaa and you I                                 to or you                                                             Microsoft version the Firefox platform                                 has I accessible to or I a two and then                                 OS X has its own kind of native                                 accessibility API and and what is an                                 accessibility API an accessibility API                                 is really very similar to the Dom it's                                 this tree it's got parent-child                                 relationships and I mean if you're                                 really if you're familiar with kind of                                 calm programming this is just a                                 relationship of components it's really                                 an accessibility component object model                                 it is saying the role state and                                 properties of given elements or given                                 objects that are on the page and screen                                 readers particularly interact with the                                 accessibility API they interact with it                                 to be able to communicate back to the                                 user what information is available to                                 them are there any buttons on this page                                 are there any headings on this page are                                 there any text fields on this page radio                                 buttons all of those roles are                                 communicated back to the screen reader                                 through an accessibility API so if you                                 can imagine me being on your website and                                 thinking I know that on this website                                 there is a it but I want to search                                 almost every website has searched most                                 home pages unless you maybe have like a                                 user login or a mailing list                                 subscription the only search you know                                 only edit field there's really three                                 edit fields that are on ready for on a                                 homepage there's a search user name                                 password and email address for maybe a                                 mailing list subscription there are you                                 know very few home pages that have any                                 other than those for edit fields now if                                 your home page has you know                                             on it                                                                  on it and if a what I really want to do                                 is search your website as a screen                                 reader user I can start at the very top                                 of your                                 page and read down that page until I get                                 to the part where your search boxes and                                 now I can actually interact with that                                 and enter my search terms and get to                                 your search results page that's I quit                                 if that's the way it has to be or I can                                 somehow find a way to navigate directly                                 to that search box and by having the                                 accessibility API expose the fact that                                 there are edit editable text nodes                                 within your Dom or within your document                                 I can use some keyboard commands to                                 navigate through your page quickly and                                 jump from one text field to the next if                                 the semantics wasn't there if there was                                 no way for a screen reader to                                 distinguish a text field from a div that                                 wouldn't be available to me and your                                 document met your website or your web                                 application would be far far less                                 navigable                                 so that's the world that we live in with                                 native components native components if                                 it's a input type equals text or input                                 type equals radio those types map to the                                 accessibility API but like we've been                                 saying not not every thing not every                                 element that you're putting on your page                                 not every component has a type and it                                 doesn't all have its own explicit or                                 even implicit semantics before I get                                 into the y re apart this is the this is                                 the problem this is the problem that                                 we're facing I want to put a slider on a                                 web page and there's nothing in HTML                                 that's going to let me do that does                                 anybody have any questions at this point                                 about the the problem before we start to                                 talk about the solution excellent                                 so what is why aria why aria is a nun                                 this is this these for their words no I                                 it's a ontology of role states and                                 properties that can be used with markup                                 languages in order to communicate                                 semantics to well I say assistive                                 technology but just period Anderson's in                                 order to communicate semantics that are                                 not in the native markup language that                                 you're using it can be used with any                                 markup language so it can be used with                                 HTML                                                                   validate using the w                                                 you're using it with XHTML                                           your document will not validate that                                 because the y Aria attributes are not                                 part of that specification if you're                                 using the experimental html                                            your document unless it's broken at the                                 time will validate because html                                     sorry but why aria is part of html                                      validates as part of html                                                different things there's a few different                                 types of guess categories there's roles                                 their states there's properties roles                                 are really the thing that says this is                                 what I am I am a button I am a region I                                 am a slider there are states which is                                 really saying you know what what I what                                 I have currently so I can be selected or                                 unselected I can be pressed or I can be                                 not pressed and there's properties and                                 these are very properties are much like                                 states but they're more persistent so a                                 property could be I have a pop-up that                                 might pop up at some point or I have                                 ownership of another component on the                                 page like we might have with the                                 relationship between a tab button and a                                 tab panel so one of the most common                                 places to get started and really one of                                 the places that we got started with                                 moving some Aria support into Drupal                                   is with regions and regions are a                                 roles are kind of broken into a few                                 different categories this what am I this                                 the actual rich semantic part of it and                                 region is one of the categories or                                 landmarks is one of the categories so                                 regions are roles that are meant to be                                 navigational aids and what they do how                                 they can be implemented and are in a lot                                 of screen readers is if you're using                                 regions to mark up the different chunks                                 of your document a screen reader is                                 going to allow a user to jump through                                 your document from one region to the                                 next so i can jump from the navigation                                 region to the search region to the main                                 content region to the footer region                                 instead of having to read up and down                                 the page line after line after line if I                                 know I want to get to the main content                                 with jaws it's the semicolon key jaws is                                 the screen reader i primarily use in                                 windows I hit the semicolon key a few                                 times I hear main content region now I                                 know it now I know that if you marked up                                 your document properly I know that I'm                                 at the top of the main content and I can                                 start reading here I don't have to read                                 all the way through the site navigation                                 or any sidebar content I can just start                                 reading the article that I clicked                                 through from google to get to your site                                 to read live regions are a special type                                 of region a live region indicates to                                 assistive technology that there's a                                 section of your page a section of the                                 Dom that is going to have changes                                 dynamically and that you want the screen                                 reader to announce those changes as they                                 happen now don't please go out and add                                 live regions to your website everywhere                                 you have to content that changes if you                                 have a website that shows a shot stock                                 ticker going along the bottom of every                                 single page and if every two seconds a                                 new stock appears in that region I can't                                 read the article on your web page is for                                 every two seconds I hear a new stock                                 symbol and a new price so we need to                                 apply these things these tools that we                                 have to make the web more accessible and                                 do better experience for people                                 disabilities we need to apply them                                 carefully we need to think about the                                 human being that we're trying to help                                 with this tool and mask is this tool                                 going to actually                                 somebody or is it going to make their                                 life miserable a place that a live                                 region would be useful is if you have a                                 web chat like a live person style of a                                 web chat where every once in a while a                                 new node is added to that section of the                                 DOM and it's a known a node that you                                 know the user is interested in because                                 they're on a page where they're chatting                                 with one of your representatives that's                                 an excellent place to use a live region                                 in Drupal we didn't put any                                 accessibility or any way any                                 accessibility no I didn't put any re                                 into Drupal                                                          tiny little places which are where we                                 put some live regions in there's three                                 places that we use the live regions in                                 Drupal                                                                bar widget which I don't know if we use                                 it anywhere in core other than on the                                 installation page but this is the thing                                 where it's like you know installing node                                 module                                                                 percent complete and as that progress                                 bar updates my screen reader will read                                 those updates to me I don't have to keep                                 navigating around on the page to find                                 the update the screen reader will read                                 those updates and it will read them                                 because the container is a live region                                 the other two places that we're using it                                 are on the password strength indicator                                 so as you start to type in your password                                 and it says week medium strong that                                 container there with that change is                                 being read out loud as the passwords                                 typed in and the third place that we're                                 using it is on the autocomplete widget                                 so that and it's not the world's best                                 implementation but it was fast to get in                                 at the end of the development cycle                                 which is as you navigate up and down the                                 list using the keyboard there's this                                 hidden live region off of the page that                                 populates the selected item into the                                 live region so that a screen reader knew                                 you breeder screen reader user can hear                                 what element is currently selected as we                                 go up and down that list there's some                                 other ways to implement autocomplete                                 this is the one that we chuchos in                                 Drupal                                                              method that pretty closely matches what                                 jQuery UI has                                 mented in                                                       roadblock removed from getting something                                 like jQuery UI autocomplete into Drupal                                                                                                        auto complete JavaScript                                 so regions are really things that you're                                 going to use to help people navigate                                 your page or their informational more                                 than being interactive really this next                                 section that we're moving into is more                                 with the interactive components on a                                 page this is kind of goes back to the                                 subtitle of the presentation a div is                                 not a button so if you have a div and                                 you have JavaScript behavior attached to                                 that div even if you have an anchor and                                 you have JavaScript it's nice when I see                                 when I look at markup or when i look at                                 the DOM and I see an anchor with a class                                 that says button dash green that's you                                 just it says button right there so it                                 says button right there it's a button                                 but it's an anchor now when I hit that                                 page when i go to read that page with a                                 screen reader it's going to say to me                                 it's a it's a link because that's what                                 the semantic is when you look at it it                                 looks like a button because that's what                                 the visual affordance is and now in a                                 case of button versus link it's probably                                 not that big of a deal though there's                                 people that would perhaps argue that one                                 way or the other it's not likely that                                 big of a deal I know that either a                                 button or a link if I click on it it                                 does a thing I don't know what it does                                 but I know that's going to do something                                 when i click on it but if we think about                                 you know using an anchor an unnamed                                 anchor as kind of the action item for a                                 slider all I hear a lot of the times on                                 a slider is link number sign and there's                                 no way for me to know if clicking on                                 that or trying to put focus on it and                                 using air I have no idea what a link                                 number slider does so or sorry what a                                 link number sign does I have no idea                                 what that does so it's important to make                                 sure that the semantics that we're                                 presenting to users match the behavior                                 or the interaction pattern that we're                                 that we're trying to elicit                                 so how can we how can we achieve                                 semantics when we're using when we're                                 either trying to build components that                                 don't exist in the markup language or                                 for some other reason like with the                                 anchor button example we find it                                 beneficial as either femurs probably                                 femurs or developers to use an anchor                                 instead of a button we can do it by                                 explicitly setting the role of those                                 components by using the why are you rule                                 property there are a set of rules                                 there's an ontology of rules you can't                                 make up your own role because if you may                                 there's an there's a contract there's an                                 agreement between assistive technology                                 are really between accessibility API is                                 excessively assistive technology and                                 content authors application designers                                 that says here are the roles that we                                 understand to exist so if you want to                                 take your anchor and make it a button                                 you can put your button clasp on it and                                 then it gets styled like a button and                                 then you can put the attribute role                                 equals button and now what happens is                                 when the Dom is being rendered over into                                 the accessibility API in the Dom you                                 have an anchor with an attribute that                                 says button role equals button and the                                 accessibility API you're going to have a                                 node of type of role button' and the                                 accessibility API is going to know                                 nothing about the anchor that exists in                                 the Dom all it knows is that a button                                 exists as a node in the accessibility                                 API again that's not as important as if                                 you have a div in your Dom with role                                 equals slider or role equals tab or role                                 equals button when it gets passed over                                 to the accessibility API it knows                                 nothing about a div what it knows is                                 that that div from the Dom maps to a                                 button role in the accessibility API and                                 now that semantic can be communicated to                                 assistive technology users                                 so application mode this is another                                 quirky part let me say that a lot of                                 people again we need to apply these                                 these tools that we have at our disposal                                 carefully to make sure that they                                 actually help users instead of hinder                                 them if you're not building a web                                 application you probably don't need to                                 use application mode so I'm only going                                 to touch on it lightly so having a tab                                 strip is probably not a web application                                 having an email client with a list of                                 inboxes a list of messages and a message                                 viewer area that's maybe a application                                 the lines blur II on the web what role                                 equals application does at screen reader                                 takes the accessibility API most screen                                 readers render the accessibility API                                 into a virtual document or a virtual                                 buffer so that it's easier to navigate                                 instead of navigating a tree list of                                 parents and children nodes we navigate a                                 document that's been rendered out but if                                 we're navigating that document that's                                 where we're using things like H to jump                                 to the next heading or f to jump to the                                 next form field or semicolon to jump to                                 the next region or landmark with rural                                 equals application applied to a section                                 of a page or to the body element of a                                 page a screen reader stops using that                                 virtual document and passes almost all                                 keyboard interaction through to the                                 browser so now if I if I hit the up and                                 down arrow keys I would normally hit up                                 a narrow down up and down arrow keys and                                 read through your document line by line                                 and I might come across the heading or a                                 button but I'd read through the document                                 line by line when application roll is                                 applied to a section of a Dom I can't do                                 that anymore arrow keys don't move me up                                 and down a virtual document because it                                 no longer exists if there is behavior                                 specified in your web application that                                 requires the arrow keys if you're                                 catching those and doing something with                                 it on the node that currently has focus                                 then behavior will happen                                 and this is exactly what we want in a                                 web application for all users screen                                 reader users keyboard only users those                                 users we talked about who can interact                                 with the web like you know the standard                                 kinda ninety percent of users do we want                                 the behavior to be consistent it crossed                                 all of those user groups again we use                                 this in a one spot in Drupal core and I                                 don't really like how we use it because                                 this really interferes with the                                 interaction pattern that people the                                 screen reader users have come accustomed                                 to on the web we are accustomed to                                 ninety-nine percent of the content we                                 reach on the web being in that virtual                                 document so you can imagine that if we                                 tab into a widget of yours and it breaks                                 our ability to hit the up and down arrow                                 keys to read down through the rest of                                 the page we're going to feel lost                                 disoriented and likely hit the back                                 button and just go to find another link                                 on google that will get us the same                                 information that we were trying to get                                 from your from your site that's why we                                 need to be really careful of where this                                 is applied right now in Drupal core it's                                 applied around the autocomplete widget                                 it's applied there so they can track the                                 up and down arrow keys so that we can                                 actually navigate a user up and down                                 through the list there are some pros and                                 cons there are alternative ways to                                 achieve this without using the                                 application mode for consistency of at                                 least the performance or behavior of                                 that widget we've used it there though                                 it does break or does interfere with the                                 interaction pattern that screen reader                                 users are accustomed to using on the                                 site and I know that because it even                                 confuses me sometimes and I built the                                 widget so I can imagine that it's edema                                 more disorienting experience for other                                 users who were not involved with it                                 they're just expecting to type something                                 in a box I'm going to skip over the the                                 next section about why overlay isn't a                                 dialog other than to say during the                                 summer of                                                          released yeah we tried and we tried and                                 we tried and we try and and not a few                                 but probably dozens of core contributors                                 tried to find a way to make the overlay                                 dialogue the dialogue that                                 self-administration pages as part of the                                 overlay we tried to find a way to make                                 this work properly to work as a dialogue                                 to use application mode to use                                 presentation mode on the stuff in behind                                 we people tried they coded up prototypes                                 I tested so many things at the end of                                 which we kind of came to a position                                 where we decided that I just we decided                                 that I decided that from being the user                                 who was doing the primary testing we had                                 come up with a solution that for users                                 of the latest and greatest technology                                 would probably be a pretty good solution                                 but for users of older technology and                                 remembering that commercial screen                                 readers some of them can cost a thousand                                 dollars or twelve hundred dollars for                                 users of older technology this was going                                 to be a really really bad user                                 experience so what we did is we didn't                                 add any of these extra semantics to the                                 overlay and what we did instead is                                 provided an ability on a user account                                 edit page for on a per user basis for                                 them to choose to disobey all the                                 overlay                                 that that really sums up what I wanted                                 to cover about Aria about how it's used                                 why it's used in how we have to be                                 careful about using it there's a little                                 bit there's                                                             happy to answer questions I've also                                 yesterday because I spent a lot of the                                 time with a spark team for spark drupal                                 for anybody who's not familiar is                                 authoring improvements for Drupal                                       Drupal                                                                   accessibility more from a user                                 experience perspective than a deep deep                                 analysis I'm happy to speak to some of                                 those findings which I posted an article                                 on my website which is just sooo felt CA                                 so I can answer questions I can go                                 through some of the points that I've                                 made in that article they are that's                                 really the practical implementation we                                 did the what's wrong what's the solution                                 and this would be a real practical                                 implementation showing I mean how to                                 apply some of these concepts to that                                 work in progress it's in alpha so I mean                                 this is not a criticism this is helping                                 to make it better so maybe we can do                                 some questions I can talk to some of                                 that spark information if we have time                                 at the end                                 of the spark okay the highlights of                                 sparazza so what I tested let's let's                                 define let's define the test I went to                                 the spark demo site i logged in and on a                                 given node node one i switched from the                                 view mode to the inline edit mode and i                                 attempted to edit the body content field                                 so that was the that was the that was                                 the use case that was the test plan                                 login no problem switch to edit mode try                                 to edit the content in line as opposed                                 to going to the advanced edit mode and                                 editing it on the regular node edit page                                 and i ran into some i guess one major                                 problem and a few little minor things                                 one of the end and so if you can take a                                 look or maybe we could put the article                                 up because it's got a screenshot to give                                 some of this more context it also has                                 some of my notes about it one spot i                                 think the first note i look at is this                                 idea that there are two anchors after                                 you switch into edit mode i think there                                 are two anchors sa vin too close or say                                 yes maybe save and close they're both                                 anchors their class clearly says button                                 i'm not sure about visually if there's a                                 visual button button knee affordance                                 about those i'm going to guess since the                                 classes button there probably have some                                 button eNOS associated with them the one                                 it's a link it says safe that's fine it                                 probably should be a button that says                                 save because it's an action but that                                 doesn't really matter as much the other                                 one is a link that says number sign link                                 number is what my screen reader reads to                                 me and that's because there's actually                                 no text inside that anchor and so not                                 only do we now have a component that                                 doesn't have a meaningful role we have a                                 component that doesn't have a name at                                 all associated with it that was one of                                 the observation so when we're looking at                                 making sure the information in our                                 application air in the document maps                                 well to an accessibility API having a                                 role is not enough having the role of                                 anchor or the role of button that's not                                 actually sufficient there has to be a                                 name to go along with that because you                                 imagine button button button button                                 button is not very useful if if if they                                 have CSS sprite images indicating save                                 load you know email to a friend and if                                 all i hear is button button button                                 button then that i can't interact with                                 your application that was one of the                                 things and again that's easy easy fix                                 for the team I mean they spend I think                                 somebody who said like all day long on                                 Monday preparing their demo so that's                                 not a big deal there's a toolbar in the                                 toolbar is tabbed so the Wiz if once you                                 click on the edit once you click to edit                                 the body node the WYSIWYG toolbar is                                 tabbed and that's nice from a user                                 experience perspective because it saves                                 space you can select which set of                                 buttons you want to be able to use to                                 operate on the content at a given time                                 those things that are tabs on which I                                 I'm certain I haven't asked anybody I'm                                 certainly that certain that the visual                                 appearance is as tabs where we know that                                 one and only one of those items can be                                 selected at any given time to me I here                                 link link you know it's a link format                                 link insert I don't know that there are                                 tabs and this may be less important it                                 doesn't really matter all that much                                 whether or not I know that they are tabs                                 or not tabs it matters that I know that                                 one and only one of these items can be                                 selected at a given time and that I know                                 which one of these items is currently                                 selected and that symantec is not being                                 presented through this user interface                                 it's almost on my website so if you just                                 go to zoo felt dot CA yeah if you go to                                 zoo felt CA it was just going to be the                                 first article there that that's on the                                 on the home page and you can click on it                                 or snowed                                                                he felt dot CA and so again so we have                                 these tabs but I don't know that there                                 are tabs I don't know which tab is                                 selected currently and once again these                                 are these are links probably in a list                                 if i remember correctly from the markup                                 and so it's easy there are why Aria                                 roles there's a tab lists rule that's                                 for the container so you put that on                                 your unordered list there's a why aria                                 Harley tab                                 and I don't remember the names of them                                 all but tab or tab button roll that's                                 when you put on your anchor so that this                                 is now a tab there's an aria selected                                 state so that you can indicate is this                                 tab selected so again you put role                                 equals tab Aria dash selected equals                                 thing true and now that indicates hey                                 look we have an unordered list well now                                 the accessibility API thinks that the                                 tab list so it's going to tell me that                                 it's a tab list we have an anchor but                                 the roles now set to tab so now the                                 accessibility API it's not going to say                                 link format it's going to say tab format                                 and we have this Aria dash selected                                 state which if we apply it to one of                                 those tabs now the accessibility API is                                 not gonna say tab format tab insert it's                                 going to say tab format selected tab                                 insert because that's the one where we                                 don't apply the Aria selected state and                                 so that takes this user interface or                                 this this component this tab list                                 component where right now I have it                                 works there's two links if I hit enter                                 on one of those links it's which is the                                 toolbar back and forth but it takes it                                 and makes it more usable the reason that                                 you don't just let the designers didn't                                 just put I assume a list of links across                                 the top and made a tab lists across the                                 top as they were trying to make the                                 application easier for people to use and                                 by providing the correct semantics and                                 states using why aria we make it easier                                 for even more people to use and then                                 there's there's a few other comments                                 there may be one of them one of the more                                 relevant ones and then I'll see if                                 there's any other questions one of the                                 more relevant ones is in Drupal                                      have the idea of tabs they're called                                 local tasks if you go to a node if                                 you're logged in and have permission to                                 edit that node you're going to have a                                 view tab and an edit tab they're not                                 really application II because all they                                 really are our links but it's the same                                 concept the same paradigm that we have a                                 context the node in that node can be in                                 one of two states it can be in the                                 viewstate or the edit state in Drupal                                   we put a header for lack of anything                                 better to do we put a header in front of                                 those tabs that said primary tabs and                                 for this                                 selected tab hidden in parentheses we                                 put the text selected tab or active tab                                 there's no semantics about that at all                                 there's not there's nothing that                                 indicates to me I mean other than the                                 text the reading it in the hopeful                                 proper translation there's nothing that                                 really that's not good but we did with                                 what we had at the time because we                                 didn't want to break the validity of our                                 XHTML theme so what we have that                                 interestingly with the spark is when we                                 go to the selector widget near the top                                 where we can choose between view and                                 edit for that in line edit those have                                 been themed with those primary tabs                                 evening but what happens in for starters                                 we probably could update that to just                                 use the why Aria roles and states that                                 accurately reflect the state of those                                 tabs with good semantics and not the                                 text that we've been using in the rest                                 of Drupal                                                             edit that selected tab hidden text                                  doesn't pop over to the Edit link it                                  stays with the view link also when I                                  select these tabs whether whether it's                                  those ones are the ones for the toolbars                                  nothing indicates to me that something                                  happened now if there's tab semantics                                  you know and I know that if you select a                                  tab something's going to happen you know                                  that there's going to be something on                                  the page that once was something else                                  and is now going to be changed when the                                  semantic is of a link you have                                  absolutely no way of predicting what's                                  about to happen next that's another                                  reason to have this have the real                                  semantics that matches matches what the                                  visual patterns that we've all we use                                  tabs because everybody knows how they                                  work and we visually present them so we                                  need to semantically present them                                  ever it came about which regions yeah so                                  the question was if I could say                                  something more about regions yeah so                                  regions there's this generic read                                  anything and I'm not going to get into                                  that because it's a little complicated                                  but essentially you can create your own                                  labeled named regions for your document                                  you probably want to stay away from that                                  unless you have a really specific use                                  case for doing that and even then you                                  probably want to consult with somebody                                  who does this sort of work frequently to                                  see if that's a good idea if there's a                                  better solution but landmark regions                                  these are a way of marking up large                                  chunks or sections of your document and                                  saying what they are the you the utility                                  is it assists somebody with navigating                                  through your document and understanding                                  what the different sections of the                                  document are and there are some                                  specifically named landmark roles like                                  form like search main content navigation                                  others content info I have no idea who                                  came up with that word that name but it                                  means footer aside which is kind of you                                  know if you have a                                                     kind of block in the side of your of                                  your website and a side of saying this                                  is this is information that's you know                                  relevant but completely unrelated to the                                  main content there's different regions                                  with different roles and they're all                                  described if you look at this back                                  pretty well there's a there's a there's                                  a document that specifically goes                                  through every role and explains why you                                  would use one instead the other and it's                                  broken down so there's a section of that                                  document specifically about the landmark                                  roles what it does for me is it helps me                                  navigate through your page and I can                                  skip past the navigation and I can skip                                  past those aside blocks and the search                                  bloc and the user login form and I can                                  get to the main content quickly instead                                  of having to read through all that                                  information or kind of hit the down                                  arrow key and hold it for a few seconds                                  and hope that and land at the spot that                                  I want to be at well you probably need                                  to keep using skip leaks and and there's                                  the reason is that I have a piece of                                  technology that recognizes what these                                  landmarks are and allows me to navigate                                  through                                  a keyboard only user who doesn't use a                                  screen reader likely doesn't have a                                  piece of technology that allows them to                                  do that now you can say and I can say                                  they should absolutely they should but                                  they don't and when ie                                                   of the market be catered towards those                                  users we didn't say what you should have                                  okay some of us said you should have a                                  better browser we said but you don't so                                  we might not go a long way out of our                                  way but we're going to make sure that                                  the experience works for you if you can                                  imagine being a keyboard on the user who                                  starts at the top of a dom or document                                  and wants to get to a link in your main                                  content and there are                                                   the top of that document and the link                                  they want to get through that is a lot                                  of pressing the tab key so it's nice to                                  have that skip to main content link at                                  the top now we leave them in ideally we                                  leave them in and we make them visible                                  to everybody but I know that's not going                                  to happen so we leave them in we make                                  them invisible what we make them show up                                  on focus so as the keyboard only user                                  when I hit tab for the first time it                                  pops up it hit tab again it disappears                                  now that's the second best way to do it                                  the best way have them show up for                                  everybody so everybody knows it's there                                  that will help depending on how your                                  page is laid out on a mobile device it                                  could help a mobile device user as well                                  if they see the icon in the top                                  yeah so so what what do I say about                                  browser compatibility use new it's a                                  hard question so some of the why aria                                  stuff has been implemented in browsers                                  and assistive technology for a long time                                  some of it has yet to be implemented                                  this is really a kind of like a css                                   scenario it really just need to become                                  familiar with what the limitations of                                  the different parts of the spec are                                  across different browsers and if you're                                  building a web application for a bank                                  where you know the browser that                                  everybody's going to be using that's a                                  lot easier and you can maybe take a                                  little bit more you can use more stuff                                  because you know exactly what                                  environment is being coded against if                                  you're building it for a website where                                  you may have any number of browser                                  combinations then you maybe need to be a                                  little more conservative about the types                                  of widgets you try to implement                                  in a way that                                  right so so that question was                                  essentially advertisement how do we get                                  advertisement onto the page in a way                                  that it is I won't even say discoverable                                  but right in your face but easily                                  dismissible and this is what happens for                                  a mean and so I would say don't do it I                                  don't want to see your advertisement but                                  and so that's easy for me to say but                                  this is what we're doing to all users                                  right we're saying bomb here's a                                  lightbox right in front of you you have                                  to dismiss this before you're actually                                  able to get to the content that you want                                  to have or here's a here's an ad that's                                  sliding in from the left side of the                                  page and you know you have to it's in                                  your face and you can choose to dismiss                                  it I'm going to say we pretty much do it                                  the same way probably you're going to do                                  it with the dialogue and you you don't                                  necessarily have to use dialogue you                                  could make it modal or you could make it                                  modeless so you could trap people inside                                  of that region of the Dom or not but                                  you're probably going to do it the same                                  way you're going to stick it at the very                                  top of the Dom so a screen reader                                  navigates the page in dom order and                                  though it respects CSS to the extent of                                  if you have display none it will omit it                                  it doesn't respect CSS that if you have                                  things floated left and floated right                                  that makes any difference to it at all                                  so you're going to want to put it at the                                  top of the dong because that's where the                                  user expects to be and you're going to                                  probably want to have the first thing be                                  a heading this as blah blah blah by my                                  sports car and the next thing something                                  that says you know dismiss this ad and                                  then after that could be the add content                                  and that's the experience that other                                  users are getting right their eyes are                                  drawn to the headline pop over to the                                  dismiss button but might skip over that                                  dismiss button and read the next couple                                  lines first knowing that they can                                  quickly go back to that dismiss button                                  to make it disappear for a keyboard only                                  user you're going to want to make sure                                  that I don't want to say you're going to                                  get really you're going to want to make                                  sure that the focus when the page loads                                  and that advertisement slides in is on                                  the dismiss button because that way they                                  know how to dismiss it they don't have                                  to try to tab a million times to get                                  that thing to disappear you can also                                  have it the Escape key                                  not going to work for a screen reader                                  user because the Escape key gets stolen                                  by the screen reader for a keyboard only                                  user the Escape key you could have it                                  dismissed the ad I think we might be                                  running out at a time I i am happy to do                                  ab off tomorrow sometime during the day                                  if people either want to talk more about                                  this if they want me to take a quick                                  look at a site or an application that                                  they're developing or have developed to                                  get some ideas and some feedback or if                                  you just I'm completely lost about                                  accessibility and I just want to                                  understand where the resources are where                                  the tools are to be able to learn more                                  we can talk about that to whatever                                  people want to talk about I'm happy to                                  do that sometime tomorrow I would ask                                  that somebody else organize it huh I'm                                  not going to organize it and have nobody
