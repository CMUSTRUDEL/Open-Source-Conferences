Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Accessibility of Custom User Interface Components using WAI-ARIA
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Web markup languages provide toolboxes of user interface components to be used to enable the development of web applications. However, there are many cases when design specifications require the use of custom components that are not available natively in the toolbox. Developers must then build custom components.

Custom components are built using markup for structure, Javascript to enable behavior and CSS to communicate look, feel, and meaning to users. Using style alone to communicate the meaning (role and purpose) of a user interface component is one of the biggest barriers to building accessible web applications.

The WAI-ARIA recommendation "provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications" ( http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/ ).
