Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Use datacenter tools to make your dev life easier
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Maintaining a big IT infrastructure can only be done efficiently with automation tools. For our DrupalCONCEPT hosting, we run a steadily growing number of servers (currently more than 120). And thanks to Chef and other datacenter tools, we do it with only 2 full-time sysadmins.

But even if you only have to set up a few development VMs now and again, you can use those tools to make your work much more efficient. And there isn't even a big upfront effort to get them running!

In this talk, I'll explain how you can deploy a consistent Drupal development and testing environment with minimal effort by adding IT automation applications like Chef to your toolbox.
