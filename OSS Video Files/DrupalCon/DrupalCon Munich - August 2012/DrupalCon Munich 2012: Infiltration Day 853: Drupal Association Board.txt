Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Infiltration Day 853: Drupal Association Board
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	The Drupal Association has been through some major changes in its governance and staffing in the last few years. It recently ran its first general election for "Directors At Large" and since 2010 has increased the number of employees by 900%. It moved its headquarters from Belgium to the USA and now manages a budget of around 3 million US dollars in annual revenue.

Where the hell does all that money go? And who are these people taking "your" money? Donna Benjamin was curious enough to be part of this to put her name in the hat for nomination last year. She successfully infiltrated the board in February.

You can think of her as your mole in the hole. With over 10 years experience in the non-profit sector, Donna knows a thing or two about what makes successful organisations tick. Diving into the inner workings of the Drupal Association, Donna dares to share some of the things she discovered in the deep end.

An experienced open source user and advocate, Donna brings her unique perspective to the Association board. She's not mega-enterprise, she's not a brogrammer and she's not American.

Come find out why you matter to the Drupal Association, how you can get involved and how your voice can help shape the direction of Drupal.

theme song or                                maybe the Austin Powers theme song would                                probably be more appropriate can I get                                you to sit on

again all right let's go guys                                Spanish okay so I'm a double agent for                                the dribble Association and the                                community this is me I also run my own                                small business but that's really got                                absolutely nothing to do with today                                except that it is very small and I like                                to think that I am trying to represent                                voices of smaller Drupal users were in                                my mission on the board this all began                                in                                                              association and i first joined the                                drupal association i then went to a                                session at Triple Crown San Francisco                                about meeting a drupal association and I                                think it was called stewards of the drop                                and I heard about how it worked and then                                I went so how do we vote oh no no no no                                no members don't vote for the ripple                                Association you just pay your membership                                fees to support the work of the                                Association right well that sounds a bit                                weird okay fine all right so anyway                                that's sort of where i first started to                                really understand what the drupal                                association was and what it did a                                dribble in San Francisco so I fast                                forward you know a little more a little                                over                                                                 the great fortune to go to drupalcon                                London and at drupalcon London i also                                went to a session which was about sort                                of the drupal association kind of a bit                                i guess like the session you're at today                                except hoping this will be a little bit                                different so at that session there are a                                lot of people there from Drupal                                associations around Europe who had forms                                national groups to get stuff done run                                local camps have a bank account just to                                you know be able to pay for t-shirts you                                know the sorts of local things local                                communities do and they had formed                                associations such as the I'm going to                                murder this word now the Denmark but I                                making something it was                                this thank you so it attractive Lee it                                means the Danish drupal association but                                in Danish so it doesn't sound like the                                drupal association and there's an                                italian one and a portuguese one and i                                think there's one in singapore and there                                are basically assured leave so out of                                this session this kind of growing i                                guess bubbling sense of dissatisfaction                                came out of it and a buff was convened                                birds of a feather but international                                drupal associations was convened to                                which i shuttled off i think i've got                                way ahead of myself five continents were                                represented at the ball yes i am very                                short yes scotland was somewhat                                over-represented but otherwise africa                                was there no one from antarctica no one                                from south america but it was very                                productive and out of that we formed a                                group I'm Genia on group struggled at                                all international Drupal associations                                they're being for these kinds of people                                to get together and share you know                                experiences and ideas there hasn't been                                a lot of traffic there but just that                                it's there we've started to at least                                build connections let me think though we                                really kind of need I mean these                                organizations are happening some of them                                have the blessing of the you know well                                actually none of them really have the                                blessing of the formal drupal                                 association some people ask for drupal                                 association if they can do it first and                                 they kind of get told all know oh well                                 that's kind of tricky and others just go                                 and do it no it's done i'm a bit of a                                 ask for forgiveness not for permission                                 kind of a person so that works me may                                 not work for others so the united                                 nations of drupal what many of you are                                 probably unaware of is that this is a                                 contingent of australians who went to                                 san francisco in                                                         meeting which formed the United Nations                                 they got involved in all the different                                 meetings and they lobby to a two key                                 things one of which they were successful                                 and one of which they failed the one                                 they failed was about the Vittorio for                                 the Security Council                                 that was a very good idea getting just                                 those people all that power I'm the one                                 that succeeded was what they said that                                 everyone in the General Assembly should                                 have a vote everyone know regardless of                                 how big they are how are we important                                 they are whatever everyone on the                                 General Assembly should have a foot they                                 won that so Australia and Australians in                                 international forums actually have a bit                                 of a reputation for sticking up for the                                 little guys and that's what I feel like                                 I'm doing we also have a reputation for                                 getting engaged in electoral reform                                 there are a few things we did first the                                 idea of the secret ballot is an                                 Australian invention we're the second                                 country in the world to give women the                                 vote and we also have reformed electoral                                 systems preferential and proportional                                 voting systems these are very common in                                 Europe not very common in the US or the                                 UK or Canada right here but it basically                                 means that your vote we we go beyond                                 first-past-the-post and we really look                                 for who do you really want to be there                                 and if you can't have your first                                 preference who would your second                                 preference be this is quite important it                                 was one of the things I argued for in                                 the process of setting the first                                 elections for the drupal association                                 remember when I said that I joined I                                 thought was weird i couldn't vote but                                 the dribble associations been through a                                 major reboot and one of the things                                 that's changed can now vote you ended up                                 with me and steve Purkiss as your

our first triple comp                                 so let's rewind a little bit the the                                 drupal association was formed in                                      there was a big bang the server melted                                 down dress replaced drupal.org with a                                 paypal that button for donations heroes                                 ten thousand dollars in                                              then went oh now what so he needed                                 to open a check account to bank the                                 money and buy the server so he formed a                                 builder non-profit Association to do                                 that and that's how it began my hasn't                                 it grown in                                                        formed what kind of similar reasons a                                 massive kind of surface had been                                 generated by the huge success of                                 drupalcon DC and so that money was                                 banked and an American associate well                                 American corporation was formed to be                                 able to handle that                                 and create and use it to you know build                                 the next trip economy and we'll have you                                 in                                                                       most of the functions they had kind of                                 began to evolve inside the Belgium                                 nonprofit were transferred to the US                                 corporation and the u.s. corporation was                                 turned into a non-profit                                             this really just happened late last year                                 and the new board was formed in I think                                 late November they had their first they                                 had their first in person board retreat                                 in December and a whole bunch of goals                                 were set which brings us to the drupal                                 association today this is its mission                                 statement I have highlighted that the                                 bits that i think are actually the most                                 important the drupal association fosters                                 and supports the community and                                 everything it does is about doing that                                 what does foster mean no no no it means                                 encourage cultivate promote nurture                                 cherish raise most importantly I think                                 it means to look after something without                                 owning it the drupal association does                                 not own the community but it is there to                                 look out for it it also means to grow it                                 and our community has grown hugely since                                                                                                      pain and things need to be resolved in                                 new and interesting ways so the drupal                                 association developed you know along                                 with the mission statement it tries to                                 make that happen with these succeeds now                                 three of these things I think are what I                                 call boring but important and three of                                 them I think are fundamental to what the                                 drupal association is all about I'll                                 leave it as an exercise to the audience                                 as to which is which depending on your                                 point of view this one                                 I think incredibly important but kind of                                 dull legal work and advocacy oh sorry I                                 should go back straight the GPL                                 important but dull legal work in                                 advocacy and there's a lot of stuff that                                 goes on to make sure something like a                                 drupalcon and can exist i mean really                                 boring things like contracts and you                                 know making sure we have insurance and                                 there are all sorts of little legal bits                                 and pieces that need to be done this is                                 the kind of stuff that the drupal                                 association looks after when it needs to                                 one of the things it doesn't do is look                                 after the trademarks they belong to                                 dress dress pays lawyers to make sure                                 the trademark is protected the drupal                                 association does not do that but in all                                 other respects everything to do with                                 drupalcon everything to do with the the                                 associated stuff which is not                                 necessarily GPL legal and advocacy work                                 is done but don't handle by the DA the                                 server's imagine Drupal without                                 drupal.org it is number one priority if                                 something's going down on drupal.org it                                 actually surpasses anything that might                                 be happening me to even a triple con so                                 the servers are very important but also                                 a lot really that exciting unless of                                 course you're into really service and                                 then I know it's very excited for you                                 I'm not I don't know what's going on and                                 this is one of the ones i think is                                 really central we're all here right                                 drupal con it's a big event there                                 acquires a lot of energy investment                                 expertise but it's really fundamentally                                 about bringing the community together to                                 learn from each other to share their                                 knowledge to work on the project this is                                 about fostering and supporting the                                 community communicating the benefits of                                 the Drupal software this is something I                                 don't think we're joining us                                 successfully as we could yet but modder                                 is part of a team that's working on that                                 we're getting better at this but it's                                 also as if there are challenges here how                                 do you communicate the benefits of                                 something like drupal to the                                 last World the vast drupal verse of                                 people who can use it what might use it                                 for different things there's a lot of                                 going on here we're not talking about                                 just you know what does the drupal                                 association to we're talking about the                                 whole project and the community and then                                 empowering a Drupal community to                                 participate and for me this is what this                                 is really important I mean actually                                 three of those photographs were taken or                                 Drupal cons so drupalcon oh let's say                                 still it's really central to what the                                 drupal association is about and the                                 drupal association is its let's be                                 honest its bread-and-butter as drupalcon                                 there are other revenue streams and I'm                                 coming to that but drupalcon is what is                                 what the drupal association spends most                                 of its time and energy on and where it                                 gets most of its revenue speaking of                                 revenue ah dammit i'm so sorry i forgot                                 to bring the annual reports okay there                                 are annual reports which have these                                 figures in them floating around some of                                 you will have them in your conference                                 packets and these figures are there                                 these are too small to read now and I'm                                 not going to go into detail anyway the                                 real point here is that now that the                                 drupal association is a                                                is all transparent you can go see this                                 and the latest                                                           online at association not tripled at all                                 you can download the report from there                                 as well association drupal.org and you                                 can scrutinize these numbers if you have                                 questions about these numbers bring them                                 to us this is not in the annual report                                 but is in the latest                                                   pull this out because i think this it                                 shows that whilst theories are very                                 strong and and I think valid perception                                 that the drupal association is a teensy                                 bit too American focused we are starting                                 to fund and support projects and events                                 outside of the United States there's two                                 key categories fit well cash grants for                                 travel expenses so ascending                                 sending developers to sprint's and                                 regional summits and drew pecans and all                                 its little stuff and are the community                                 cultivation grants I've got the fizzy                                 versions so you can see there that you                                 know the rest of the world I like the                                 rest of the world is kind of there in                                 twenty twelve the drupal association                                 board had decided to concentrate on                                    improving drupal.org was number one and                                 number six the site builders and                                 developers this was a huge project there                                 was a lot of work done by our good                                 friend Angela Byron I don't know if she                                 sleeps but she really rallied people to                                 talk about well how could we improve                                 Drupal dog and she ran on consultations                                 and she talked to people and she came up                                 with this huge list of things and a                                 pretty much kind of settled into two                                 buckets you know there was stuff that                                 developers wanted to make it easier to                                 you know work on code and there's stuff                                 that site builders wanted to you know                                 evaluate modules and a whole bunch of                                 things so these are the kinds of things                                 that bubbles to the top now improving                                 the site for developers was number one                                 and improving the site improving Jim                                 little foresight buildings was number                                 six of the six objectives for                                            lot of them depended on should we                                 upgrade to Drupal                                                       this new development and that was a big                                 question we should we do this                                 development on d                                                        bit fast by angie's love of d                                          seemed to make more sense so the drupal                                 association has invested a lot of time a                                 lot of money into this upgrade of                                 drupal.org to d                                                      some improvements along the way that's                                 not something we're all waiting for the                                 upgrade but it's actually a really big                                 job but it's seen as kind of critical if                                 we're not running our most current                                 version of Drupal on our own website                                 yeah I think that's the kind of                                 compelling argument the training                                 directory so one of the things that's                                 been identified as a problem for Drupal                                 is the lack of talent how do we get more                                 people knowing Drupal how do we put them                                 in touch with people in their local pub                                 in the local part of the world where                                 they can learn more so we're building a                                 training directory to help people with                                 that and part of that is a big                                 communication challenge as well so we've                                 started global drupal training days                                 which allow people to allow those                                 companies today ok let's do training on                                 this                                 four days a year and concentrate our                                 communication so that more people know                                 about it so the next ones coming up                                      of September there are already a bunch                                 master at home roughly how many have we                                 got thrown up now we've got about                                                                                                               and you're not signed up for you know                                 trainers and they're not signed up                                 please get them to do so and engage and                                 engage in the global kind of buzz around                                 it we have a hashtag learn drupal hash                                 learn drupal and i really want to see                                 kind of you know some bars around this                                 as you know as we as we get towards it                                 and on the day itself it's right before                                 software freedom day so that could be                                 good to regional events for developers                                 now this is the one I know least about                                 so anyway okay can you do a quick update                                 on regional events for developers codes                                 friends around the world right codes                                 prints around the world to kind of work                                 on things and help get developers to                                 these events is one of the things that                                 we're also been looking at Drupal is a                                 career choice was one of our six                                 objectives and it is the one that has                                 received the least love the drupal                                 association staff kind of ran out of                                 energy and time to put into this but I                                 think the community still has a place                                 here this is an idea to reach out to                                 universities whether it's creating                                 student user groups on campus or                                 reaching out to academics who might be                                 teaching web and teaching computing to                                 start looking at Drupal as part of that                                 mix as an example set and and just you                                 know generating users there are heaps of                                 universities using Drupal so I feel like                                 we have connections where we could be                                 doing more with this then we are and if                                 a drupal association can't now you know                                 my double agent had here the community                                 can we should be working together on                                 these kinds of things which brings us to                                 now munich drupalcon they all having an                                 awesome drupalcon                                 it's pretty good food air conditioning                                 food good things there's a board meeting                                 tonight so this will be my third in                                 person board meeting this was one of the                                 things that I also kind of argued                                 against when we were sort of talking                                 about how we're going to have these                                 first elections well one of the things                                 that was said was that board members had                                 to commit to a certain number of                                 teleconference meetings a year and four                                 in person face-to-face meetings they                                 also said we want to have a more diverse                                 kind of bored and I went so you want a                                 more diverse board and you've got to go                                 to these four meetings and you have to                                 pay to attend those meetings yourself                                 and that's like halfway around the world                                 for me I don't think I couldn't afford                                 it and I was upfront about it there's no                                 way i could fall because it effectively                                 three of those meetings will be in north                                 america and one would be in europe to                                 what triple cons onto at other times I                                 just thought I couldn't do it so I think                                 saying you want diversity and having                                 this requirement to attend meetings and                                 pay for it yourself these are mutually                                 exclusive things sure you can you know                                 have either of them but you can't have                                 both make your choice which is more                                 important and I was compelling                                 apparently in that argument and the                                 drupal association acknowledged that                                 they would support the travel funds for                                 people who couldn't afford it and I said                                 well I think that's fair that means we                                 might get people from parts of the world                                 for whom you know this kind of expense                                 is just not not doable thank you so I                                 also got involved in the election in the                                 debates about how I should have the                                 elections that preferential voting thing                                 i mentioned i also talked about who                                 should vote in there were debates about                                 this setting up this election and I                                 there were a few different ways should                                 it just be members of the drupal                                 association remember way back at the                                 start was like I remember where I vote                                 so should we give those people who vote                                 should it just be members of the drupal                                 association who elect these community                                 members of the board that's not really                                 representative of the entire community I                                 there is it so we settled on people who                                 have accounts on drupal.org who have                                 been active in the past                                               created their accounts more than two                                 weeks ago when we announced the                                 elections were happening so that was                                 kind of how we defined what I call the                                 citizenry of Drupal you are a citizen of                                 the Drupal verse if you have an account                                 under a little so I'm are more active                                 than others some just go there it's mina                                 idol bug report and Nick off again                                 others are spend their days and nights                                 hammering the issue queues deeply                                 involved in the project all of these                                 people are part of our community I also                                 think there are parts of our community                                 who do not have accounts on drupal.org                                 there are probably colleagues in our                                 organizations there are our clients                                 there are users there are hobbyists who                                 have you know found drupal on a shared                                 host that was installed by someone else                                 for them have set up little websites I                                 feel like they are part of our community                                 not everyone agrees but we settled on                                 have an account on drupal org active in                                 the past                                                              really didn't say go well into this                                 slide so I mentioned before that fit one                                 of those countries that is largely                                 populist the first drupalcon in the                                 southern hemisphere is happening in sao                                 paulo in december i think that's pretty                                 cool i think this is even cooler                                 I might be a little bit biased in both                                 directions because see the sound from                                 Melbourne now I won't get it is really                                 important from my perspective that we                                 are that those of us who are not part of                                 the sort of North American community are                                 loud and an Australian terms obnoxious                                 about being invisible we're not                                 invisible we're great friends at parties                                 that we the global community dribble                                 community is is as global in its                                 representation and in its actions as the                                 Association as it is in reality there                                 are people at this conference

now like I said the                                 drupal association has nothing to do                                 with the project itself it's about                                 fostering and supporting the community                                 and I'm a community elected at-large                                 member of the board so you see how I see

it                                 before we really dive thinking do I                                 really want to thank here because I know                                 that was a bit weird but I always found                                 that you come to these things and ideas                                 come up and you sit in these talks i                                 really think that it's important to                                 communicate you know amongst each other                                 i'm not the only expert here there is                                 expertise in the room and ideas to be                                 shared so thank you for indulging me in                                 that the big thing now is so now what so                                 the some people have said that the drip                                 they didn't really know that there was                                 this kind of global drupal association                                 but the global bit of course is                                 debatable right but you know there is da                                 drupal association get involved this is                                 why i say if you do not like the way the                                 new drupal association works there is                                 but one way to change it well actually                                 there are always two ways to bring about                                 change evolution and revolution right                                 well actually think there has been a                                 kind of revolution but i think it was a                                 bit top down right there was change but                                 was driven by people who discussed it                                 all in kind of private sure they posted                                 what they were doing there's very much                                 you know happen behind closed doors a                                 change happened but now that it now that                                 change has happened i think it is up to                                 us to get involved and say what we want                                 how do we want this to work for us again                                 my two hats double agent remember stand                                 to the board you know as you owl was                                 just discussing stephen i did that a                                 bunch of other people did that i think                                 there were ten candidates there were ten                                 candidates for these two spots some                                 people thought there should have been                                 way more than that i was pleased there                                 was                                                                    know                                 I think someone vesser who was on the                                 board tapped him on the shoulder and                                 said you should run there's only been a                                 couple of nominations so I hope we see a                                 lot more than                                                        next                                 so Steve just said I'm just repeating                                 for the recording that was back at a one                                 of the cxl events in Europe he went up                                 to veteran said so how many people have                                 applied and they said oh we've only had                                 two so so Steve thought well I'll throw                                 my hat in the ring sorry that's a                                 colloquialism isn't it I will have a go                                 at that that's probably also a                                 colloquialism anyway um I think you get                                 what I mean so standing for the board is                                 is something that i would recommend if                                 you really want to be involved at it is                                 the highest level but that doesn't mean                                 that you're removed from the action like                                 I've spent hours at drupalcon                                 volunteering and it's been fantastic and                                 working directly with the staff and part                                 of my infiltration I had to go to                                 Portland for one of the drupal                                 association meetings I spent a week in                                 the office with the staff and that was

what it does and how                                 it supports the community because                                 membership whilst it's fairly small                                 mouth amounts of money I think it's                                 something like twenty two euros to join                                 as an individual and seventy two euros                                 to join as an organization I mean it's                                 really it's chicken feed it's not a lot                                 of money they'll have a sliding scale so                                 if it's too much money you can choose to                                 pay less if you think you're you could                                 pay more you can choose to pay more                                 that's fairly new we also have a renewal                                 system now so if you used to be a member                                 of the turtle Association and

renew but you know                                 encourage others this is a pretty low                                 bar to get involved and and help because

                      the importance of doing this boating so                                 you remember I said about we had the                                 argument about who could vote well once                                 we kind of crunched the numbers that                                 came to about                                                      million people could vote
