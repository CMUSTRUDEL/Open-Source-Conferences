Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Agile Gymnastics and Timebox Tumbling - A Hybrid Approach
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Learn from the experiences of Examiner.com's team. We've done it all - cowboy, waterfall, extreme, and agile scrum.

Learn why...

Waterfall doesn't always work
Agile has a place, but isn't the holy grail
Cowboy can kill the relationships you have with your stakeholders
How "Fixed Scope" is a lie
That a combination of approaches is the answer
The Examiner team has carefully honed, updated, improved, and iterated its process for over two years. It continues to evolve, improve, and make development more consistent and predictable.

Project management requires a blend of techniques and tools to effectively shepherd projects from ideation to release. We'll explore and discuss different tools and methodologies that can help make your project successful.

Saunders first presented on this Topic at Drupalcamp Austin as one of the Keynotes. The presentation was updated for Drupalcon Denver. The presentation is being updated and improved upon for Drupalcon Munich!

Saunders has worked in project management at a variety of shops ranging from the Western States Arts Federation as Senior Director of Technology, pingVision as Senior Web Producer, one of several Principals in Vintage Digital, Senior Director of Technology at Examiner.com, and most recently as CTO for Trellon LLC.
