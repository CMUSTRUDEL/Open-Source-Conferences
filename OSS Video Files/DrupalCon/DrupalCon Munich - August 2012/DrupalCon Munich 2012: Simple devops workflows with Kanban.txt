Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Simple devops workflows with Kanban
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Efficient teamwork in Drupal projects can be a challenge even with modern tools like Git, Redmine and so on. We also need the right processes to distribute tasks, detect bottlenecks and make well-directed improvements. Only if we're able to keep work flowing at a steady and realistic pace, we'll have happy clients and team members.

Kanban is a great way to achieve this goal. It's a lean workflow management method that is both powerful enough to revolutionize car manufacturing in Japan and simple enough to quickly adopt it in IT teams without throwing all existing processes over board.

In this talk, I will explain all important aspects of the Kanban method and demonstrate how it works in an easy to understand example.

	                              I'll be good to go                               ok                               so hello and welcome to my second talk                               today with my previous talk i had the                               slot before the lunch so i was                               preventing everyone from going to lunch                               now i have the problem that every one of                               you had lunch i suppose and heading into                               the digestion coma now to prevent that                                I've decided to do my talk completely in                                all caps no I won't just a short blurb                                about myself my name is your religion                                from Germany and I've been a sysadmin                                all my complete all my professional life                                discovered Linux in                                                   thurs erdman work then went into IT                                training mainly open source training                                training for system administrators which                                brought me to web de one of the biggest                                left portals in Germany I first did a                                few months of IT training there and then                                was offered a position as IT trainer                                where I started building my own team for                                the first two months I was the team and                                then I started hiring additional people                                and we are were running the billing                                system for example and other things we                                built the data warehouse system and                                eventually were acquired by one and one                                where I became head of IT core services                                a department of three teams with about                                ten that means each and we were                                providing the complete IT department                                with central services like the backup                                system for                                                             central tools like software deployment                                and running some security intensive                                subsystems in                                                        another business and i found that fri                                seal IT which is a I teashop basically                                doing ops for devs we are targeting                                developers and taking care of all things                                i T so developers can focus on their                                projects and it's our task to get up at                                night and replace hard disks or restart                                some Apache servers we are at frys deal                                on Twitter and our main product is                                trooper concept which is a platform as a                                service that's completely optimized for                                drupal we started with drupal concept in                                                                                                    munich and since then have been growing                                our hosting infrastructure and growing                                our customer base all over europe                                trooper concept follows the same concept                                we provide and manage the complete ITI                                infrastructure and our customers can                                focus on building awesome websites in                                all those years I've discovered that                                doing DevOps is hard                                and if you look for the problems there                                are many first DevOps is a huge topic                                it's a broad horizon doing everything                                from the idea of an application of a                                product getting it into production and                                keep it up is not only a huge time space                                but also includes many many tasks you                                have developers and you have admins and                                then you can go into more detail and say                                okay there are database admins there are                                storage admins there are system admins                                and so on so all these people have their                                own problems their own advantages and                                weaknesses and you will see that when                                you are doing a project that encompasses                                all of them there are many principles                                there are many internal or external                                people you do work for and of course                                each project they are doing is the most                                important and for each project you are                                expected to give it the highest priority                                each of these projects is isolated so                                it's competing for resources you have in                                your dev ops team and of course you                                never have enough people you never have                                the right people with enough time to do                                all those tasks within those projects                                and especially in the ops part of their                                tops you also have a lot of                                interruptions there's always an incident                                there's always an outage that prevents                                you from doing the work you plan to do                                or you were supposed to do and with                                project project deadlines looming you                                get always into trouble if there is an                                outage that takes you more than a few                                minutes to resolve                                so in consequence there's a lot of load                                from time to time most of the times more                                 than you'd like to have and there are                                 also times where you don't have much                                 load for example between projects or                                 during those times in the project when                                 for example there's more development to                                 do than system administration it's hard                                 to keep an overview over the different                                 tasks that are to be to be done in a dev                                 ops team who does what who does what as                                 a next step is a question that is most                                 of the times hard to answer that causes                                 you're planning to be quite poor it's                                 hard to estimate how long it will take                                 you to complete a certain tasks if you                                 always have to take into account that                                 there could be an outage around the                                 corner so if you say okay it'll take me                                 two days to finish that and a database                                 cluster goes down or another cutter                                 stuff is happening then you won't be                                 able to reach this goal if you say okay                                 it probably will take me two days but                                 I'll take into account that there may be                                 outages as you say I'll go it'll take me                                 three or four days you may be able to                                 reach that goal before your is to make a                                 time but as soon as you tell the project                                 manager he will learn a lesson from that                                 and simply take half of the numbers you                                 give him as a project estimation in turn                                 that generates dissatisfaction on all                                 sides and mistrust he told me you will                                 be able to finish that in four days well                                 did you take into account that their                                 bill will be the interruption so I plan                                 three days and get to my project goal                                 earlier or should I plan additional days                                 to two                                 have space for the unplanned things and                                 there's a growing mistrust into all                                 that's set inside the project context                                 the more mistress quickly you have the                                 more external influence that will be by                                 example from higher management and there                                 will be people quite unhappy with that                                 job there are methods to deal with those                                 challenges and one method that's gaining                                 ground in the IT space and especially in                                 DevOps is Kanban so that's what this                                 talk will be about Kanban is a term that                                 was coined at the half of the last                                 century about                                                          worked at Toyota in organizing the                                 production he took goals of the lean                                 manufacturing movement especially the                                 goal is to shorten heat time to increase                                 productivity and to create satisfaction                                 and trust at all levels he chose Kanban                                 as a method and Kanban is a built from                                 two japanese syllables with can meaning                                 signal and band meanest meaning card                                 because basically he took signal cards                                 to mark stations in the production line                                 that were ready to receive another part                                 of a product what you don't want into in                                 a production line is for example a                                 worker dropping her screwdriver and                                 products start piling up before his or                                 her station so they used signal cards                                 that signaled to the previous                                 okay I'm ready to receive another part                                 and to work on that and until that                                 signal card wasn't there there were no                                 products coming in so Camden relies on                                 visualization you can tell at all times                                 which station is prepared to do another                                 step of the work and it's based on a                                 pool principle it's not that we are                                 pushing work and it will be eventually                                 done it's that we are pulling work into                                 as soon as we have the capacity to work                                 on it there's an interesting use of a                                 pull principle in real world and that's                                 the imperial gardens in Tokyo in Japan                                 it's a beautiful place and you can enter                                 it free of charge but at the entrance                                 you will be handed an admission ticket                                 all it contains is that it asks is a                                 text asking you to return that ticket                                 when you leave the gardens you don't pay                                 for admission so what's the use of this                                 card well the thing is people can only                                 enter the gardens as long as there are                                 still cards to hand out if all cards are                                 on the way in the gardens you won't be                                 allowed to enter not until cards are                                 left at the exits and brought back to                                 the entrances there will be the                                 possibility of entering the garden and                                 that way they keep population in the                                 gardens on a level that's pleasing to                                 other visitors that's a pool principle                                 take more in as long as you have the                                 capacity to do so                                 and stop taking more work in our context                                 in if there's not any more to the tool                                 to spread the Kanban method was built as                                 an adaptation of that principle in IT                                 it's mostly David Anderson who will                                 started using Kanban as a as an project                                 management method in IT in about two                                 thousand seven and these are the core                                 attributes the Kanban method uses to                                 have more control over the processes in                                 our workflows first visualize the order                                 flow make visible where work goes on                                 hopefully as planned and where work                                 stops so you can see where to focus on                                 to prevent problems from getting worse                                 the second one I think is the most                                 important limit work in progress stop                                 piling up tasks have a limited list of                                 tasks that are worked on per person or                                 per team and focus on that on these                                 tasks get them out of the way as soon as                                 possible and then get more pull in more                                 work this makes it possible to measure                                 and control our work is flowing through                                 our teams and to our people you can                                 measure how long it takes the tasks from                                 getting into the team being worked on                                 and getting finished and being passed on                                 define the rules explicitly so define                                 for example what it means that a task is                                 finished                                 how can we see that the task is finished                                 how can an individual person determine                                 if the task is finished write that down                                 distribute that rule and have people                                 understand how work flows from one                                 station to another building feedback                                 loops so you see early when problems                                 arise and deal with them and then use                                 models use science for improvement                                 another word that's connected to can                                 banish Kaizen which means continuous                                 improvement so Kanban is a kind of agile                                 way of dealing with workflows but it's                                 very simple to implement and it's                                 creating results very quickly how does                                 that work in practice                                 first as visualization I apologize for                                 the non translated title here so                                 visualization is done with a Kanban                                 board this can be a physical board like                                 a pin board or a whiteboard and of                                 course they are also digital equivalents                                 you can use these boards are divided                                 into columns and those columns symbolize                                 the different steps a product or a task                                 or an order goes through you start with                                 a backlog where you decide which are the                                 next steps which are the next tasks we                                 have to work on and then you have                                 columns you determine yourself what                                 these columns contain for example it                                 could be the first real stage could be a                                 planning stage so you take a task out of                                 the back lock into the planning stage do                                 your planning and then you go into                                 development finally you go into delivery                                 and a task now is in production every                                 tasks goes from left to right over that                                 board so for example there could be a                                 task see in the backlog still not being                                 worked on a task be in the planning                                 phase the task a could be in the                                 development phase here you could now go                                 on to work on task a and move it on to                                 delivery sometimes it's a good step to                                 divide a column for example if a task                                 like a is finished with developing but                                 not quite ready to                                 be delivered you can have that and say                                 okay there's a task face is being worked                                 on or task is finished and ready for                                 delivery and waiting for the delivery                                 team for example for the top person                                 doing the delivery to pull it into their                                 column and now it's important to add                                 another attribute to the columns which                                 is the work in progress for example we                                 could say at all times there shouldn't                                 be more than two tasks in the planning                                 stage if you already have two tasks in                                 the planning column we won't pull                                 another one from the backlog development                                 could be two as well and delivery for                                 example if it's only one person doing                                 that they should focus on one task so we                                 limit the work in progress in the                                 delivery stage two one that's basically                                 the way you do visualization of tasks                                 and their stages they are in it's easy                                 to set up such a Kanban board you can                                 use a physic report as I already said                                 you can use an Excel table they are                                 web-based Kanban tools on the Internet                                 it's your choice if you go into more                                 detail we could differentiate different                                 or the types such an order could be a                                 requirement a feature that has to be                                 developed and productive i use a story a                                 change request on for for the production                                 environment of production defect                                 maintenance work everything you are                                 working on should go on to the Kanban                                 board and by the for example by using                                 cards of different colors you could mark                                 the different order types                                 tasks also differ in regards of time so                                 we could say okay there's some kind of                                 standard tasks that's simply being                                 worked on and it's finished when it's                                 finished that could be also a deadline                                 connected to the task that tells us okay                                 we are two days away from the deadline                                 we should start working on that or                                 there's still a few weeks until that                                 thing has to be finished so we can put                                 it on the back burner that can be away                                 wake deadlines connected with it meaning                                 well do it as soon as you have time                                 there are for example some maintenance                                 things that aren't connected to any                                 deadlines so you can say okay these are                                 low priority tasks and on the other side                                 of this game that could be urgent tasks                                 that have to be worked on immediately                                 and these expedited two tasks could be                                 even as urgent as to break the                                 work-in-progress limit if there is a                                 real outage for example you can say okay                                 tasks marked as urgent don't care about                                 work in progress limits everything has                                 to step back and the the task the outage                                 has to be solved first                                 these should be total exceptions though                                 because as soon as your project managers                                 see that work in progress limits can be                                 broken they try and do that and they                                 shouldn't do that it'll break the whole                                 method and all the visualization will be                                 useless without adhering to those broken                                 progress minutes limits                                 okay that's the basics now how do we get                                 tasks into the backlog                                 you should                                 taken to count different attributes of                                 the tasks to decide to decide which                                 tasks to take into the backlog in other                                 methods such as scrum there's a there's                                 put much effort into sizing a task into                                 determining how much effort is connected                                 with the task there are methods like                                 planning planning poker and other things                                 kanden doesn't use such elaborate                                 methods because in dev ops most of the                                 time it's very very hard to determine                                 real effort since many tasks can have to                                 be worked on by very different people                                 you'd have to get to the table the DBA                                 the system administrator some kind of                                 storage administrator and networking                                 expert and other people and the costs of                                 getting all those people into meetings                                 which they do very reluctantly I guess                                 is very very high and to be honest not                                 worth the effort there are far more                                 efficient methods for example the one                                 okay dear project managers we have to                                 open slots in the backlog which one of                                 you has the biggest budget and do a                                 weighted round-robin by budget sighs                                 that's quite easy doesn't involve many                                 people and you get the tasks onto the                                 board quite quickly and what your                                 project managers will see is that tasks                                 get off the board quite quickly so it's                                 it's not very reasonable to put much                                 effort into effort sizing it's far more                                 efficient to get those tasks being                                 on the backlog should be filled                                 regularly and a frequency of once a week                                 is most of the times are very good                                 frequency then tasks have to be worked                                 on and finally delivered delivery should                                 be regularly as well because it creates                                 trust if you can show finish tasks for                                 example also every week your project                                 managers will gain trust in your                                 estimations gain trust into the method                                 method and so your support will be                                 getting stronger by support by                                 management support by project management                                 and other side's what's important and an                                 important difference to scrum there is                                 no time boxing a task is finished when                                 it's finished if you're finishing it                                 early good get to the next task if it                                 takes longer than you has to mate it                                 well get it done and especially in more                                 mature organizations you can do atok                                 delivery so it's really finished when                                 it's finished as soon as a task reaches                                 the done column to the right you can                                 signal to your project managers ok                                 there's another task done so we can get                                 on with our work the highest form of                                 that is called continuous deployment so                                 delivery takes place all the time                                 equally to for example scrum there's                                 also a stand-up meeting where the people                                 involved with the tasks that the dev ops                                 team or teams and the project managers                                 convene daily and do short exchanges how                                 things are and the goal of these                                 stand-up meetings is process improvement                                 so everyone is invited to show and tell                                 where are we getting on well and where                                 are the problems most of the time these                                 problems can be seen on the Kanban board                                 as well and I'll show you an example                                 shortly there's also an Operations                                 review in some bigger distances that                                 also involves management to get                                 improvements all over the place I've                                 done a few comparisons already so let's                                 look at these a bit more detailed Kanban                                 as every agile method is far superior to                                 the old waterfall method of doing                                 projects where there's first a big                                 planning phase then a big development                                 phase and then the big bang release and                                 a party afterwards I think I don't have                                 to get more into that and how that is a                                 really inefficient way of doing projects                                 of course in comparison with another                                 agile method is more interesting and                                 Kanban stands quite well there there are                                 no fixed roles for example so you don't                                 have someone like a project owner and                                 which is quite hard to pinpoint who is                                 the product owner of your postfix                                 cluster for example and everyone is                                 involved but they don't get fixed role                                 names an important difference also is                                 there are no limits to specialization so                                 your database administrator can be a                                 database                                 illustrator and stay a database                                 administrator iterations are only                                 optional so you gained quite a lot of                                 flexibility here there's also no time                                 boxing as i already said and planning                                 and delivery are independent from each                                 other which even increases the                                 flexibility of the Kanban method your                                 central metric is lead time so how long                                 does it take you to finish a task new                                 orders can come in at every time you                                 don't need special meetings to do that                                 for example if you're using a digital                                 Kanban board tasks can be added at every                                 time the order size is not limited and                                 as I already told you estimations are                                 not mandatory I've talked a lot about                                 visualization so I'm going to visualize                                 how the Kanban method works in practice                                 and I'd like to take you with me on a                                 day in cumberland                                 that's our Kanban board and that's the                                 people who are involved right we have                                 the product or the project manager in                                 blue we have the developers and in green                                 of course the operation skies and they                                 start with using Kanban as a method to                                 organize you also see the                                 work-in-progress limits to planning past                                 development tasks at all times let's                                 start with the project manager deciding                                 what tasks are the first ones to get out                                 of the backlog jail he chooses a and B                                 which reaches where the planned column                                 now reaches its work in progress limit                                 otherwise I think he would be he would                                 have added C and D as well                                 now the pool principle starts and there                                 are two teams of developers one working                                 on project a                                                          out of the planning column our project                                 manager is quite happy that he now                                 finally can add C and D to the planning                                 column work goes on and our happy                                 project manager things you need also JK                                 & L in the backlog so here at these                                 now a is finished and goes into the                                 delivery column and the team that has                                 finished a can now pull see from the                                 planning column into the development                                 phase B already gets finished but they                                 can't get it out of the development                                 column because                                 full with the Ops guys working on a so                                 we just goes to the waiting part of the                                 development column that B is waiting for                                 delivery doesn't mean there's no place                                 for a third project in development the                                 development column still is full and now                                 the hits the fan there's a problem                                 in delivery                                 d country into development although he                                 is finished because there are two                                 development column and the work in                                 progress limit there is to the project                                 manager still doesn't know about the                                 problems on the right side so he decides                                 that k is urgent and it's going to be                                 next not a problem now the developers                                 realize that they are blocked and you                                 could ask well okay so can ban ism is a                                 method of preventing people from doing                                 their work no it isn't it just focuses                                 all people on the problems in the                                 workflow so the developers instead of                                 being able to pull k or D they go over                                 to their colleagues and say okay how can                                 we help you we have free capacity how                                 can we use the capacity to get things                                 moving again                                 do                                 there's a problem occupied and the                                 project manager was asking can work on                                 hands and the developers have to say no                                 we start working on that as soon as we                                 have solved the problem with a because                                 still the work-in-progress limit in                                 development and delivery prevents us                                 from going on there's a problem and we                                 first have to solve their problem as I                                 said stop piling up                                 now                                 the other developers can also go and                                 come to the rescue while the project                                 manager of course thinks of his own                                 things                                 now also the capacity of the second                                 delay development team can be put to                                 gain more results because obviously this                                 problem has it happens a lot it's good                                 to invest some time into doing some test                                 development to prevent those problems in                                 the first place now even the project                                 manager counts and offers help                                 and somewhat later we have progress a                                 fine                                 maybe cuz                                 development                                 developers already have the memory and I                                 what                                 I is planning and our project manager                                 does what the project manager does                                 that's how a con man works in practice                                 it limits the work that is being done at                                 a time focuses capacity onto those tasks                                 and it visualizes especially where we                                 have problems every task doesn't move                                 from one column to another there is a                                 reason and we should do everything to                                 resolve that reason and that's all you                                 need to visualize how work flows through                                 your teams how work is distributed in                                 your teams and all you have to do                                 there's one thing you need to do get                                 management and prove approval to do work                                 in progress limits these wips are the                                 key that the candle method works and if                                 someone I've seen that if someone is                                 allowed to break those limits the whole                                 method breaks to the price as a whole                                 that's all you need and then roll in a                                 whiteboard or use a teacher to tool and                                 start visualizing your workflow you're                                 the question                                 yes yes yes I stepped over that yeah                                 people realize                                                       possibility that's a part of the kaizen                                 of the continuous improvement to realize                                 okay things are moving more quickly in                                 the development phase that we                                 anticipated and so let's raise the work                                 in progress maybe sometimes you'll have                                 to do the opposite to reduce work in                                 progress because you see that tasks                                 always get stuck there are always                                 problems with four tasks being worked on                                 concurrently and so you maybe should                                 lower your work in progress limit maybe                                 for some time or permanently so as they                                 did you can of course alter your alter                                 the rules under which you work but I                                 can't stress that enough don't break the                                 react wips I have a few links before we                                 go into the questions there are of                                 course books you can read the first to                                 suggest is David Anderson spoke Kanban                                 successful evolutionary change for your                                 technology business in which he explains                                 how he took the production version the                                 manufacturing version of Kanban and made                                 and IT management method out of it                                 there's also websites for example a mini                                 book that compares can balance from                                 people using the scrum method in                                 practice have the limited society which                                 is a community of condom practitioners                                 and on their website you'll find a lot                                 of resources on that and for the German                                 readers there's also websites in German                                 law I'm sure                                 other languages and if you're on the                                 road as much as I am there's also a                                 podcast that deals with Kanban will name                                 the itk podcast and that's a short                                 introduction into the Kanban method                                 we've been practicing that in my                                 business for quite some time now in a                                 very small team but it has enabled us to                                 get an overview over our internal task                                 as well as our client orders and it's so                                 lightweight that there's not much                                 overhead to the method so especially if                                 you are a small team it's very very easy                                 and very very efficient to use the                                 common method and with that i'm open for                                 your questions                                 the question was if there's a real                                 serious problem getting a task further                                 to the right can we put it on the back                                 burner basically and back into the                                 backlog to work on it at some other time                                 you could you're free to do that but                                 it's a bit of cheating because that's                                 again hiding the the problems and                                 procrastinating on working on their                                 causes I think what's most valuable is                                 that you see okay this task has been in                                 that column already last week why didn't                                 it move forward and let's rally together                                 and solve the problem that's preventing                                 it from moving to the next column of                                 course if there's a reason to to                                 deprioritize it you could of course put                                 it back into the backlog but don't make                                 it a habit                                 yep                                 mm-hmm                                 what I've experienced is also most there                                 are oftentimes internal tasks some                                 maintenance things where they are                                 expressed that someone should do that at                                 some time and I'm for example quite good                                 in into thinking of many of such tasks                                 and filling our columns with that but if                                 you have many of those tasks that get                                 stuck because there they don't have                                 enough priority it's good to talk about                                 them in a stand-up meeting for example                                 and say okay that task has been stuck                                 for the fourth time now is it really a                                 task that we should do or should we just                                 get rid of that so I think that's                                 another way of getting rid of tasks that                                 should be done sometime there are many                                 tasks you can lose all together without                                 any consequences                                 could you give an example dependencies                                 which we haven't anticipated before                                 mm-hmm if you see that there's a task                                 that's dependent on another so it has to                                 wait until the other task is finished or                                 at least has moved for who has moved on                                 you could for example do some kind of                                 prioritization using for example paper                                 cards on a whiteboard you could classify                                 them into different priorities and first                                 work on the ones with higher priority if                                 you see that a task contains a part that                                 is has to be done first maybe you should                                 split that task into two and first and                                 do one first and the other afterwards                                 that's that's a thing you should discuss                                 in your stand-up meeting if you realize                                 okay it's bit more complicated than we                                 thought then discuss it with your team                                 what what to do at that place                                 yes that's a very good question if you                                 have tasks that are specialized for                                 example is it good to is it a good idea                                 to move them off onto another board yes                                 it is for example if you have a persons                                 that have a very special job description                                 for example an IT architect you don't                                 have many of these usually or a DBA your                                 only DBA it could be efficient that                                 these people have day their own boards                                 so they can visualize at which stage is                                 which broke project I am participating                                 in most of the times these people are in                                 different projects at the same time and                                 they need to visualize that to keep                                 control on their tasks so their tasks                                 will show up on different boards then                                 there are also a project that that big                                 that it's a good idea to split them into                                 heroical boards for example the project                                 manager could have a rough outline of                                 the project on a board and then                                 specialized boards with specialized                                 teams for example if you have a huge IT                                 organization you could be able to split                                 this also hierarchical Moses I come back                                 to you                                 e                                 I think it's it's a good idea to put all                                 tasks your team is working on onto the                                 board and so if you are working with                                 support tickets for example they could                                 have a place there too to visualize for                                 example if there are urgent support                                 tickets that require immediate action                                 and so as I said there is the                                 possibility of having even urgent tasks                                 that break the work in progress limits                                 because there's for example if there's a                                 real disaster on the customer side and                                 you need to deal with that first of                                 course because it's the customer you                                 could visualize that as well by putting                                 it on the board making it a red card for                                 example and prioritizing it over all                                 other tasks                                 yeah that's also a possibility to                                 introduce lanes into your board which                                 are divided vertically and you may have                                 a fast lane for special projects                                 you need                                 I think that that depends on your                                 organization for example as I remember                                 it with one and one there are many many                                 project managers doing many many to                                 their projects and that's where the                                 tasks originated and instead of flooding                                 the IT department with tasks that have                                 to be dealt with in weeks project                                 managers can start with breaking up                                 their projects into different tasks they                                 keep from themselves for the time being                                 and then start taking those tasks one by                                 one and putting them into the backlog                                 the question was how to deal with people                                 that are not present that work remotely                                 for example how do they get access to                                 the Kanban board they are of course                                 different solutions and the David                                 Anderson in his book or actually talks                                 about having a physical board with cards                                 and for example having someone who is                                 responsible to transfer the physical                                 board which is easily seen walking by                                 into a digital system they he developed                                 the condom method mostly at his time at                                 Microsoft and they were using Microsoft                                 I don't remember the product name some                                 kind of team organization product of                                 Microsoft to visualize their work but                                 they also had a physical Kanban board                                 and someone was responsible to                                 synchronize these I don't know how                                 efficient that can be so we for example                                 prefer to do it or digitally we are                                 using Trello com which is a free tool                                 you can get a trailer com it's basically                                 got these columns you can add as many                                 columns as you want and by dragging and                                 dropping you moving the cards over this                                 board that you create and you can create                                 as many boards as you want so for                                 example coming back to your question you                                 could do a board for each project where                                 you differentiate your tasks for example                                 you have one column with your planning                                 tasks one column with the development                                 tasks and things like that and then take                                 tasks from these project boards onto a                                 team board where they go from left to                                 right and I think you I've got quite                                 good experience doing that in a                                 completely digital form which makes it                                 very easy to integrate people that are                                 not present at your office place                                 there are proven solutions to do that                                 for example Google Hangouts skype chats                                 things like that depends on your way of                                 working i think that's not a thing that                                 that can man tries to solve that's a                                 more general topic you have to discuss                                 with your team                                 mm-hmm it is that's why we got to the                                 place got to a point where we decided to                                 only use one trailer board for the                                 work-in-progress task that we are                                 working on divided into columns like                                 like I presented here and they are                                 boards we use for collection mainly /                                 topic or by project where we don't we                                 use them only as a place to store our                                 tasks not to organize them as soon as a                                 task is going to be worked on it moves                                 to the work-in-progress board where it                                 moves from left to right in the usual                                 manner                                 no we don't                                 no most of the time it's it's a good                                 idea to measure the speed of the tasks                                 moving over your board you can for                                 example document when that tasks got                                 onto the board and maybe do a log of                                 when it moved from column to column                                 tools like trailer will do this                                 automatically and then you could do a                                 measurement how quickly tasks move which                                 will also point you to sources of                                 problems when you see that the there's a                                 column where tasks stay for a lot longer                                 time than in other columns you could                                 focus on the reasons why that is the                                 case but I think if you structure your                                 tasks small enough there's a really real                                 speed gain where tasks won't stay on the                                 board very much very very long and                                 that's that's a thing that makes all                                 people quite happy it makes the the                                 devops guys and girls happy because                                 tasks vanish as soon as they come as                                 quickly as they come and of course it                                 makes the project managers happy as well                                 mm-hmm                                 mm-hmm you are free to to structure your                                 columns for example and you are of                                 course free to as we talked already                                 about to introduce additional boards for                                 example a special board for the DBA so                                 you could have a placeholder card in the                                 delivery column and signifying that this                                 task is being delivered especially by                                 the DBA at the moment for example ease                                 doing certain setting up table spaces or                                 things like that and so                                 mm-hm                                 you just divide the delivery column for                                 example into different sections yeah                                 right suck                                 here we go                                 you could for example                                 I have                                 to dba's but only one network admin of                                 course they the WIP of the network admin                                 would be lower than that of the dbas for                                 example but so you're visualizing two                                 dimensions basically you see all the                                 tasks that are in delivery but you also                                 see where they are in delivery who                                 delivers them and that by the way makes                                 it very easy to answer the question who                                 is doing what and who is doing what next                                 okay if you have heard of the questions                                 I'm here all day feel free to
