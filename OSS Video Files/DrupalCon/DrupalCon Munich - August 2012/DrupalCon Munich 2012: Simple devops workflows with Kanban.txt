Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Simple devops workflows with Kanban
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Efficient teamwork in Drupal projects can be a challenge even with modern tools like Git, Redmine and so on. We also need the right processes to distribute tasks, detect bottlenecks and make well-directed improvements. Only if we're able to keep work flowing at a steady and realistic pace, we'll have happy clients and team members.

Kanban is a great way to achieve this goal. It's a lean workflow management method that is both powerful enough to revolutionize car manufacturing in Japan and simple enough to quickly adopt it in IT teams without throwing all existing processes over board.

In this talk, I will explain all important aspects of the Kanban method and demonstrate how it works in an easy to understand example.
