Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: The State of Drupal Community Education
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	There are so many community projects around education that it is overwhelming to figure out what is going on, much less actually help out. There are all kinds of projects from using Drupal as an education platform, to certification programs, to classes for teaching people about Drupal itself. This session will look at the big picture of education initiatives in the Drupal community, break them down into some manageable categories, evaluate where we are, figure out where things overlap, and make some proposals for where we can go in the future.

If you are interested in Drupal education/training but don't know what's what, this session will survey the ongoing projects and sort them out. If you are already working on community education, this will serve as a starting point for us to discuss what other work is being done in the community and how we might collaborate better. Related to this session, we also plan to have a BoF at the conference to continue the conversation about collaboration.

Note that this will not cover commercial projects or resources around Drupal education. This is focused on the community efforts that are out there (things like Drupal for Education, Drupal Dojo, Learn Drupal, skill maps, etc.).

agonizing                                  seconds first of all thanks for                               everybody coming this is the last                               session on the last day and if you all                               are nearly as tired as I am I appreciate                               you actually walking into yet another                               session room and I love that this is                                huge room for the last session of the                                last day but anyway thanks for coming um                                I'm Addison Barry I work for la la botte                                worked for them for about five and a                                half years and we started out as a                                training and consulting company and now                                we're really focused on strategy design                                and development but we still have our                                training stuff which is mostly focused                                now on our site Drupal eyes me which is                                our video training stuff so we do more                                online training than we do in person                                training now and I'm now technically the                                director of education at lolla wat but                                most of that means working with this and                                we'll talk a little bit more about my                                history of how I got to where I am in                                the slides so this session is basically                                about free educational material                                resources for the Drupal community this                                is not about I'm not going to talk about                                the money making side or that kind of                                thing like that's not what the focus of                                this is this is what is our community as                                an open source community how we trying                                to provide and grow our community and                                educate our community on the free side                                of things not that money's not involved                                but we'll get to that                                um I also want to say before I dive into                                this that this is very much just sort of                                my personal experiences and personal                                take I'm sure that I have lots of gaps                                in in the presentation that i'm going to                                be doing I've already learned about lots                                of things here I didn't know about                                that's a great thing about going to a                                con and you're like what who's doing the                                what great so there probably are going                                to be lots of gaps and I would like this                                to be the start of a conversation and                                not just like some kind of information                                that sort of being thrown out at people                                as some canonical thing so in terms of                                that sphere and what I'm talking about                                here I'll give you a little background                                how I got to where I am I started out in                                a triple community and didn't know how                                to code didn't know anything was going                                on and had to teach myself and I did a                                lot of head banging started to kind of                                get involved with the community a little                                bit was helping a little bit with                                documentation and then Josh coning                                started this thing called the Drupal                                dojo about five and a half years ago and                                it was pretty revolutionary because                                basically he was like I know Drupal                                stuff I know there are lots of people                                who need to know Drupal stuff so once a                                week I'm going to get online and I'm                                going to share my screen and I'm going                                to talk about how to do something in                                Drupal for an hour and share it with                                whoever wants to come and help and it                                was pretty awesome and the group he                                created a group on Bruce doctor when I                                work for this and it exploded like                                hundreds and hundreds of people were                                signing up and he was completely                                overwhelmed and but it was it was great                                like there's like suddenly there's this                                community of people who wanted to learn                                and people who were doing lessons but I                                have to say really was a person doing                                lessons and there were you know josh is                                always like I need other people to help                                me do this help help and so there was                                some other things that came up and for                                me personally it was great because that                                was it gave me a place to sort of                                suddenly engage like there was a lesson                                I could go to there was a chat channel                                where all the students would get                                together and chat and and with the                                instructor and we would all just talk                                about whatever the topic was for that                                lesson for the day and it felt like a                                safe place for me to enter being                                stupid with Drupal like it was just sort                                 of an environment where you could be                                 stupid and you were around other people                                 who were okay with being stupid and that                                 was a huge barrier for me entering into                                 this world of like geniuses who were                                 making open source software right so so                                 that was like a really big moment for me                                 and then I got deeply involved in the                                 community after that I tried to Josh got                                 busy and there weren't enough teachers                                 who were stepping up to teach I did some                                 teaching and tried to continue the dojo                                 but basically after a while there                                 weren't enough people willing to to                                 teach and lead and put other structures                                 in place and so the dojo just sort of                                 drifted and I basically at that point                                 felt like my energies were better spent                                 elsewhere so then I moved on to the more                                 manageable task of becoming the                                 documentation team lead for the project                                 so those of you in the recording who                                 don't get the sarcasm um but I did I                                 took on the dock lead role and I also                                 got a grant from the knight foundation                                 to improve Drupal's documentation and                                 alerts in mint be writing some                                 documentation about how to contribute                                 and traveling all over the world to talk                                 to people about how to contribute to                                 documentation and I did that for about a                                 year and a half two years I guess I was                                 doc lead and then I handed that off                                 about two years ago and I was pretty                                 worn out at the end of that and I um I                                 basically stepped back from the                                 community for a while for about a year                                 and a half I removed myself from the                                 community I focused on work and I                                 focused on going outside spending time                                 with friends who didn't know anything                                 about Drupal it was kind of an amazing                                 period of my life and then in Denver to                                 book on denver in march of this year                                 Bryan her stood a presentation about the                                 Drupal ladder which is an initiative                                 specifically focused on getting people                                 to be able to contribute to core to                                 Drupal core development and and it's a                                 very systematic thing we create lessons                                 you progress through the lessons in a                                 very distinct order to get you to where                                 you need to go and I got really excited                                 for the first time in a long time about                                 the community education stuff because it                                 felt so focused and I feel like this is                                 something not to sound caddy or anything                                 but it sounded like it had really had a                                 chance of success I've been through a                                 lot of disappointments in the community                                 and and this seemed focused enough two                                 to maybe get somewhere so I got excited                                 about this again and in the midst of all                                 of that and I was like okay there's                                 ladder stuff and there's all these cool                                 things that are going on and of course i                                 work in drupal education i was just sort                                 of doing my thing in my corner it's like                                 I need to find out what's happening out                                 there I need to see what's going on                                 right now with Drupal education and how                                 can I jump into those things and how can                                 I relate that to this excitement I have                                 what you will at ur and that's why this                                 presentation exists because I went to go                                 try and find that stuff and I was like                                 what is going on like I couldn't figure                                 out where stuff was I didn't understand                                 what was happening which things were                                 really had is any of this actually                                 anybody doing anything I couldn't there                                 was no I had no idea what how to even                                 start and I was really confused and                                 frustrated so as I started to pull that                                 stuff together i thought i would share                                 this information so that's sort of my                                 history I know it was a bit long-winded                                 but I wanted to give a little                                 perspective in terms of where this list                                 is coming from in my flavor on it                                 because you may and probably will                                 disagree with with some of it or have                                 other gaps that I don't even know about                                 that you can fill and I want like that I                                 expect that that's that's where we're                                 coming from here so when I went through                                 I sort of was trying to compile a list                                 of like all the different stuff that had                                 sort of been going on and i know i'm                                 like i said i'm sure that their stuff                                 that's not on this list but these are                                 the main ones that i was looking at and                                 trying to see what was going on there                                 and then I sort of tried to start it a                                 little bit of research to even figure                                 out sort of what's the sort of the                                 status of some of these so so some of                                 these are grayed out quite a lot because                                 they pretty much as far as I can discern                                 are inactive                                 and then there are others that are                                 pseudo great out the dojo and the open                                 premium skillset stuff because there's                                 still sort of stuff happening but it's                                 certainly not anything resembling full                                 stream and and a lot of activity but I'm                                 going to walk through what these are                                 real quickly here so to pidato orga                                 documentation handbooks on drupal.org                                 it's there it exists there's teams still                                 working on it and and that's sort of the                                 that's the core of our Drupal community                                 education that's where people go and                                 have gone for a long time dojo so the                                 dojo started five and a half years ago                                 the dojo still exists it's really                                 sporadic there is a group and they talk                                 to each other but in terms of actual                                 lessons going up I don't think any                                 lessons have actually gone up since the                                 beginning of the year or something like                                 that and it kind of comes and goes in                                 spurts get quiet for a while then people                                 do bunch of lessons and gets quiet kind                                 of thing they had a spinoff well                                 actually there's sort of two spin-offs                                 from that baccata and doli or the drupal                                 open learning initiative which were                                 efforts sort of around making                                 project-based learning experiences right                                 so we're going to build XYZ site and a                                 bunch of students will build the site                                 and we'll have project management and                                 all of these things and as far as I can                                 tell they're just certainly the                                 resources never really coalesced to make                                 that actually really happen and as far                                 as i can tell those are not active                                 projects at all open curriculum is in                                 the curriculum and training group on                                 groups drupal at oregon and it is a                                 larger discussion about like creating a                                 curriculum that's an open source                                 generally available curriculum that                                 anybody who wants to teach drupal can                                 use and specifically there's sort of a                                 subset the first service I guess major                                 step in getting that going was coming up                                 with these skill sets like defining what                                 is it that people are going what are the                                 goals and how do we break things down                                 sort of a vocabulary as it were for                                 training materials and assessments and                                 all of these things and so that got                                 really far and there's actually quite a                                 lot of stuff like that is on the group                                 with that and there's like a nice huge                                 colored flowchart                                 that it has all of this stuff but now                                 it's just kind of hanging out and                                 nobody's really actually doing stuff                                 with it but there's a lot of work that                                 went into that and it's sitting there                                 waiting to be used drupal guilds was the                                 idea of actually creating like a guild                                 in Drupal where there would be mentors                                 and you would sort of like journeyman                                 into a role and work your way through                                 guild levels and it would be sort of                                 like a personal recommendation building                                 and sort of us not exactly certification                                 this is one of those things that was                                 sort of like not exactly certification                                 but you know your guild member this                                 person's been in the guild for so long                                 and they've walked through these steps                                 and these people vouch through their                                 work kind of a thing and that's no                                 longer active skill compass is Johan                                 Falk launch this site this year skill                                 compass org and basically it's it's a                                 way to aggregate Drupal material from                                 all over the web and categorize it                                 according to what it is that you would                                 be doing and then you can put it into a                                 tree that's like okay I wanna learn                                 drupal colonel in drupal theming i want                                 to learn how to work with node templates                                 or i want

  that are out on the web to their relate                                 to that particular thing you want to do                                 drupal ladders the project that I'm                                 involved with now that Brian her started                                 again that's building a series of                                 lessons in a very specific one direction                                 order no branching and treeing kind of                                 thing really to take you from the bottom                                 rung of I don't really know what's going                                 on to being a contributor to Drupal core                                 and then of course we have just sort of                                 drupalcamp trainings that are happening                                 lots of camps the tom has training prior                                 to it bag camp has is a free event and                                 has free training days so there's a lot                                 of a lot of education that's available                                 from going to just local regional events                                 and then the DA has started this global                                 training day is anybody how many people                                 here know what the global training day                                 is our                                 heard of it before okay so maybe a third                                 the drupal association is trying to                                 spread the word about drupal and get                                 people sort of boot strapped into what                                 it is so they started this initiative                                 the global training day to get trainers                                 all over the world to provide                                 introductory drupal training on the same                                 day and then promote that and it should                                 be very low fee or free and i think the                                 there was one i believe in june which we                                 took part in there's another one coming                                 up September and then I think we have                                 another one planned for December so and                                 they they do provide the Acquia hello                                 drupal curriculum if you want to use                                 that or you can use your own curriculum                                 and just take part in the training day                                 so that's the stuff i came up with then                                 I sort of am attached to or have some                                 sense of what's going on with it there                                 may be other stuff then if people have                                 other things I'm like wait a second                                 there's also this awesome thing you're                                 stupid you know feel free to talk into                                 the mic and tell me that I'm cool with                                 that um but there's also like this is a                                 lot of stuff there's a lot of different                                 things going on and over quite a period                                 of time so I still was confused even                                 when I kind of got myself down to at                                 least understanding that I'm sort of                                 like I what is the goal what is the                                 purpose here like ah how do I help where                                 do I go and the thing is is like there's                                 lots of different people who have                                 different goals like we're you know                                 community education we want to educate                                 the community we want to help each other                                 as teachers is really vague and fuzzy                                 and a lot of people have different                                 understandings of what that means and                                 they have different specific goals                                 within that arena and so everybody is                                 just sort of doing anything which is not                                 a bad thing that's quite the open-source                                 way right like do lots of iterations and                                 the best one wins kind of a thing just                                 we are really to the best one                                 you're the focused effort coming                                 together part it so there's a lot of                                 stuff we've thrown out there and there's                                 a lot of stuff that's just sitting                                 stagnant so I didn't really feel a lot                                 better when I got got the first stage of                                 things I still thought that it was                                 overwhelming so when I'm stepping back                                 to look at it this is sort of and I'm                                 sorry for the the geek plus plus minus                                 minus but are when I look at like our                                 community and trying to do this and the                                 problems that we may or may not have                                 liked to me like some of the greatest                                 strengths that we have is that we do                                 have a lot of really great ideas and we                                 have a lot of people with with really                                 great expertise like people who really                                 know their in our community its                                 massive we have a lot of people who                                 actually know what's going on and we                                 have a huge community to try things out                                 with and people who are really excited                                 and willing to learn you know it's like                                 a lot of smaller communities just trying                                 to like prototype or figure out how to                                 do something when you have no one who                                 can use it and give you feedback it's                                 really difficult really massive                                 community that we can try the stuff out                                 on we can experiment quite a lot but of                                 course we end up with our resources                                 spread out a lot because everybody is                                 sort of doing a different projects with                                 their own vision and their own goal or                                 their own specific end in mind and so                                 the resources get spread out which makes                                 it really difficult for us to move                                 anyone forward in a meaningful way it's                                 also super hard for someone coming from                                 the outside to figure out how to help or                                 get involved at all it took me forever                                 to make that list of like going through                                 groups drupal.org and just googling                                 around the internet like just tons of                                 stuff that's out there and it's really                                 hard to figure out it took me a long                                 time to figure out what what was out                                 there and then I was like but is this                                 one even active and I'm only looking at                                 posts from two years ago and I'm like                                 hmm maybe I shouldn't get involved in                                 this one because I don't think I'm gonna                                 be me talking to myself it's it's so                                 it's really really hard to get people                                 actually working                                 together I mean when you want to work on                                 Drupal core you can go to core office                                 hours you can figure out you know                                 getting into the issue queue and you can                                 just start working on things it's                                 surprisingly because everybody says oh                                 my god it's so confusing but you know                                 what working on code and Drupal is so                                 clear compared to doing many other                                 things in our community so it's a big                                 problem for us yeah like if I want to                                 help on the views module it's relatively                                 clear at least where to get started we                                 need lots of things for success this is                                 just a bullet list I kind of just came                                 up with just give me some focus in terms                                 of my thoughts and this is not specific                                 to education and the stuff I'm talking                                 about it's not specific to Drupal this                                 is like open source this is just this is                                 the kind of stuff you haven't                                 particularly in a volunteer environment                                 but being able to focus our effort                                 collaborating with other community                                 projects because education is not in a                                 silo by itself like we're not just                                 making stuff up out of the air and then                                 just training people like we're related                                 to lots of other things that are going                                 on I mean the core mentoring hours and                                 office hours and all the stuffs                                 happening there like that is also                                 education when people are in the issue                                 queue and they're getting the patch is                                 reviewed that is education so we're not                                 in a silo and we need to also look at                                 the bigger picture i think sustainable                                 resource models this is just again                                 classic open-source problem right we're                                 volunteers at the end of the day i got                                 to make the money so and what ends up                                 happening is you have a volunteer or two                                 volunteers to get very excited about                                 something they get gung-ho they work                                 their asses off and they burn out and                                 they burn out hard and then everything                                 just goes boom when that one moving                                 factor goes away we need to find some                                 way to keep regenerating that energy and                                 new people which is also related to                                 turning the learners into contributors                                 this is a huge                                 huge problem with the dojo people would                                 come they would learn and they would                                 leave and they didn't turn themselves                                 into contributors who were teaching and                                 helping sustain the dojo itself and it                                 just flatlined message again generally                                 true of stuff and open source it's                                 really hard but if you can't teaching is                                 great and spreading the word but if we                                 can't become a self-sustaining thing                                 then we're not getting ourselves very                                 far so to address those we had a Boff                                 earlier today which was fascinating and                                 it was about training we just got                                 together and everybody was doing                                 training and what was fascinating to me                                 the reason I say fascinating it is                                 because cuz you're like but the reason I                                 I found it really fascinating is because                                 it's just was this classic here are all                                 these smart passionate people who have a                                 lot of awesome ideas and want to do                                 something and we're all like wow I                                 didn't know you're doing that or huh yes                                 you know it's like communication you                                 know like again this whole like the                                 whole thing of like you can't find what                                 projects are going on or how to get                                 engaged with them we don't even                                 effectively communicate everybody who's                                 trying to move in this direction you                                 know unless we get to an event and you                                 meet some people here and some people                                 there there is a groupon groups a                                 triple-dog where there are many groups                                 on groups I drew but I or be they have                                 something to do with education but I                                 would like to propose that we use the                                 curriculum and training group as the                                 main place to communicate and you know                                 other education efforts or initiatives                                 have their own group on groups                                 drupal.org but there's nothing to say                                 that we can't create you know on groups                                 you can create sub pages there's nothing                                 to say we can't create a page that says                                 these are the active education                                 initiatives that are going on in the                                 Drupal community here is a two-sentence                                 or three sentence summary                                 what this initiatives about what the                                 goals are and what it's trying to serve                                 and here is how you can get involved                                 with that like I mean I'm talking just                                 super simple here I'm not trying to get                                 like into big vision like can we just                                 you know sort of start to coordinate                                 what it is that people are actively                                 working on so if you're working on                                 something you have a project or an                                 initiative let's start to bring that                                 information together so when someone                                 comes in its new and they want to find                                 out like here this is our current state                                 of things we can get into all kinds of                                 conversations about maintaining the page                                 and then stuff gets all but but can we                                 just micro microphone please I just want                                 to say i love you um but that list that                                 you talked about that inventory does                                 exist so I'm gonna put that at the top                                 of the group so you can find it awesome                                 thank you that would be lovely mmm so                                 but anyway I put in you know when that's                                 like a very simple thing but I do think                                 and I haven't done this yet because I've                                 been just mulling on these things                                 honestly but I would sort of like to                                 propose like with the curriculum and                                 training group that we think about how                                 we could reorganize that group to be a                                 landing place for lots of stuff's going                                 on and we you can do stuff to organize                                 groups in terms of how it presents the                                 information it breaks things down and                                 and I think it would be good for us to                                 the brainstorm or net originally when i                                 did this came up with this presentation                                 I wanted to do ab off after the                                 presentation to talk about these things                                 but this is the last session so no ball                                 but there's the sprint tomorrow and so                                 folks do it for a round for the screen                                 and want to meet on this stuff and just                                 you know thing is we can change how this                                 landing page looks like and then we can                                 change it again I think it's not like we                                 don't have to have a committee that                                 meets for two hours to decide what                                 should be on that page in which tabs we                                 should have okay we should we can just                                 do something if it's not serving our                                 needs change it so I'm great tomorrow to                                 actually just start to put some changes                                 on there                                 see what we can come up with so that's                                 that to me is like one of the simplest                                 things just as a starting place the                                 first two bullet points that I had                                 unlike focus and collaboration I'm just                                 sort of breaking this stuff down these                                 are sort of existing projects that I                                 know about that our places that people                                 could get involved if they want to and                                 and in sort of categories of stuff                                 because people have different interests                                 in getting involved with education or                                 they're in a different place or that                                 they wanting to provide or contribute                                 different things so kind of broken it                                 down a little bit so curriculum and by                                 curriculum I'm separating that out and                                 that's based on actually on the open                                 curriculum definitions and if you go to                                 in the curriculum and training group                                 there's a section called open curriculum                                 and there are links for things like                                 definitions and all the work that's been                                 done and it's actually pretty cool stuff                                 but what I mean by curriculum is is the                                 more overarching meta stuff like                                 defining what it is that that people                                 need to learn and being able to sort of                                 categorize that stuff into a kind of a                                 vocabulary that we can then assign to                                 materials and the actual stuff and buy                                 materials I'm talking about actual                                 syllabus or syllabi you know and                                 resources like books or videos or you                                 know how people actually I want to learn                                 this thing defined in the curriculum is                                 a thing to learn and like the general                                 goal of what that thing is the materials                                 actually get you from point                                           thing which also includes assessment                                 which as we talked about in the boffin                                 earlier today our community is woefully                                 like under representative we don't                                 really have open source assessment tools                                 so i would consider all of that part of                                 materials like that actual feedback                                 process of starting from zero and                                 actually learning something so these and                                 for so for those two the documentation                                 team i mean again drupal.org                                 documentation is a huge resource in the                                 community and it's a                                 the on ramping for that is sort of set                                 and has there's actually quite a bit of                                 documentation of how to get involved in                                 what all that means the Drupal ladder is                                 at drupa ladder org and that again is                                 creating lessons specific for a very                                 specific goal getting involved with core                                 so their material there are lessons                                 there are videos associated with the                                 lessons and it actually just walks                                 people through steps so if you want to                                 teach people that stuff you can go there                                 take the lesson use it any way you want                                 to so it's just material that's                                 available and then skill compass again                                 they said skill come astorga as a way to                                 aggregate all kinds of materials from                                 all over the web so I was started by                                 Johan earlier this year so those are                                 definitely things to check out and see                                 in terms of like materials that are sort                                 of already out there and being                                 aggregated in some way I'm sure there                                 are tons and tons and tons of free                                 materials these are just the three main                                 ones that to me are for me personally                                 are currently sort of active and viable                                 so and then teaching like curriculum is                                 great the the materials and actually you                                 know all the resources you need is great                                 and then there's just actually getting                                 up in teaching people some people just                                 want to teach they don't want to build                                 curriculum how many people here like                                 writing curriculum CN I knew that I knew                                 there'd be a couple hands yeah how many                                 people really like teaching people yeah                                 it's a little so so so sometimes you                                 just want to teach people right and                                 there are like you know community ways                                 of doing that and so like I said there's                                 the DA's global training day and                                 basically if you go to juvie org slash                                 learn dash Drupal there's sort of some                                 information there about like the                                 upcoming one and who's involved and                                 where that's happening and stuff but if                                 you want to provide training and be part                                 of global training day you should start                                 talking to the DA about that the Drupal                                 dojo it's not terribly active right now                                 but it's set up so that basically you do                                 an online                                 lesson you pick your topic you pick what                                 you want to do what you want to talk                                 about you say hey dojo people I want to                                 do this they announce it people come                                 they watch it's recorded so again it's                                 just a way for you to kind of put stuff                                 out there and get feedback from people                                 and then of course just camps and                                 meetups and not even like official                                 training sessions right when you get up                                 and do a session you can talk about                                 stuff don't forget about the users                                 helping users stuff as a path for people                                 to learn yes in San Francisco at least                                 that's like the biggest ongoing                                 community resource for people yes but                                 how do they plug into it yeah no I know                                 they come to write it up and then they                                 go to the users helping users which is                                 separated from ah can you guys actually                                 separated as overrated okay right which                                 is similar to like your drop in right                                 and but yeah I mean like the actual like                                 interaction at events thing right is                                 huge and in just getting up in but                                 that's the thing is like you know people                                 think they are going to go to a event                                 and I'm going to stand up and I'm going                                 to do a presentation and I'm going to                                 just like talk to a bunch of people you                                 share information that way I wouldn't                                 exactly call that training her education                                 per se I guess it depends but but there                                 are other things you can do and meetups                                 and camps and actually our meetup panel                                 we had yesterday there were lots of                                 ideas about different ways to run                                 meetups and some of them were really                                 cool ways of getting people engaged and                                 learning stuff together but go to events                                 talk to people that's what you want to                                 do you should be going to events and                                 actually talking to people so but i                                 guess like so i have these like sort of                                 as resources where to get in and like I                                 would really like for and like                                 particularly you know like here we have                                 materials and like I said I'm sure                                 there's other stuff that's tons of                                 materials that are out there somewhere                                 we talked about this a bit at the BOK                                 it's like how do we                                 find that stuff put it together you know                                 I don't have answers for any of this but                                 it would be great if we could get some                                 sort of focus for like you know here's                                 here's a general curriculum and the open                                 curriculum project is working on that                                 materials how do we gather materials in                                 some meaningful way for people who want                                 to do training or who just want to teach                                 themselves and dive into things and then                                 you know again with like teaching like I                                 don't know is there a way that like                                 there's dojo stuff that can interact                                 this global training day I don't know is                                 there a way that that dojo and camps and                                 meet up so the training day like all of                                 these things where people are trying to                                 put on events where we actually do                                 training is there a way for those two                                 work together better I don't know but I                                 think it's a question worth asking you                                 know we've all got limited time we're                                 all trying to have you know the based                                 impact that we can so anyway those are                                 things I think we should try to sort of                                 and again this is my break down into                                 those three categories I'm sure there                                 are other things out there that people                                 are interested in or other ways you                                 would break this down this is just my                                 first shot across the bow as it were um                                 the last two bullet points on there was                                 sustainable resources and you know like                                 turning learners into contributors this                                 stuff which is part of the resource                                 problem and so resources resources a                                 problem volunteer work is hard it's hard                                 you know I mean you love it but like at                                 the end of they got to pay the mortgage                                 so and there are two things and actually                                 I was talking with with nickel earlier                                 this week about he was teaching                                     students himself and he came up with a                                 process for them to basically be peer                                 teaching and and that you know that is a                                 great thing and like that's the kind of                                 thing like if you want to if we want to                                 make other projects sustainable I think                                 that's the thing is to not like force                                 force people into a system that sort of                                 makes them take both sides of the coin                                 in order to progress in some way is a                                 way that we might be able to do                                 something like that I think that this if                                 you go here so PHP for developers com                                 this is a course being offered by Emma                                 and Lorna and a it's a it's a course we                                 need in the Drupal community right now                                 because it's about PHP soo and symphony                                 to Andrew ville                                                       don't know that stuff so it's it's                                 course material we're going to need is a                                 community moving forward what I find                                 fascinating about this is the funding                                 model on this because they're not                                 offering this just as a course and you                                 pay for a seat you attend the core so                                 you get your knowledge and you go home                                 the way that their funding this is per                                 company and so it's got a higher rate                                 per seat as it were but if they get a                                 certain amount of funding for going to                                 the class you get to go to the class and                                 you get the materials from that plus                                 they're going to open source the entire                                 curriculum so that everybody else can                                 use it and to me that's a really                                 interesting model for how we can fund                                 educational materials right i mean                                 they're going to spend anybody who has                                 prepared curriculum knows how long it                                 takes and time is money it's expensive                                 as hell to come out with curriculum and                                 that's one of the biggest problems like                                 once you spend all that time doing all                                 that spending all that money is really                                 difficult to turn around and give that                                 away for free and then have to do it all                                 over again so anyway I think this is                                 just a really interesting I wanted to                                 just put it up here because I think it's                                 a really interesting model I've not seen                                 it before for educational materials like                                 we do this right we do this kind of                                 thing all the time for code right we                                 payout would get this amount of money                                 will do this code and then it you know                                 it's open source because Drupal is open                                 source so we open source our code all                                 the time and there's all kinds of                                 companies funding that we don't do it                                 with educational stuff maybe we could so                                 something definitely worth looking at I                                 think um it's really interesting but you                                 know yeah some kind of way to get stuff                                 paid for so that people can really poor                                 their time and energy into it and show                                 that because it's worth quite a lot and                                 a lot of people expect to get that stuff                                 for free for some reason and then also                                 creating models in terms of how we are                                 engaging with people who want to learn                                 to turn them into actual contributors in                                 the system itself just ideas thoughts                                 radiating out of my brain so i'm going                                 to i wanted to definitely leave time for                                 sort of conversation because we're                                 certain definitely having a lot of                                 conversations in our boff so i wanted to                                 leave some time so my conclusion here m                                 is yeah like this is what I've come up                                 with so far what do we do next does this                                 matter enough to people is this                                 something that we are ready to come                                 together with and figure out or are we                                 still going to keep still in a place to                                 keep iterating you know this is like the                                 thing light was with working on code ok                                 we'll try this we try this like contribs                                 the great land of try it out we'll have                                 five different varieties and then we'll                                 see which one's best and then that will                                 become sort of a canonical thing that                                 the community uses is is our education                                 still in that stage are we ready to                                 coalesce in focus I don't know I think I                                 feel like I want it to be I would love                                 to see like some focus and direction                                 happening and stuff like that we also                                 though we don't have a benevolent                                 dictator reading the education product                                 project you know there's no there's no                                 buck stops here there's no you know                                 people that you automatically go to to                                 say okay well they're just going to say                                 this is this is it cut it off we're                                 going to stop arguing and talking about                                 this we're making a decision that                                 doesn't tend to happen Heather go yeah                                 I'm sorry I already spoke we just wanted                                 to save them make one clarification                                 and and the you said the skill sets for                                 example that we're sitting there and                                 we're not really doing anything but                                 thing with them but they're actually                                 completed we can actually accept that                                 that piece of work is done and so the                                 things that for example the skill                                 compass is built off of that and I'm                                 also developing a                                                     can be taught at college level with                                 someone who's doesn't even know Drupal                                 and that's built off this skill sets as                                 well and that's going to be done and                                 similar signed with similar fashion                                 perhaps that the PHP developers is that                                 it's going to be free but so that's that                                 I think the thing I actually really want                                 to ask you about cuz I have a feeling we                                 could end up talking about all of our                                 brilliant ideas and just chewing it all                                 up again I just feel like I don't want                                 to go there what I want to keep on                                 building I think what you've done with                                 the with the Drupal ladder is just                                 fantastic and your leadership abilities                                 are just stellar um what can you just                                 talk again a bit more about your like                                 the disappointments and why do you think                                 drupal ladder is working what's making                                 that work um I'll leave it there yeah                                 that's a really great question and it is                                 interesting to me because I you know I                                 get like let's get people riled up and                                 I'm like I'm not sure if I want people                                 riled up because I don't know if I the                                 energy because I've definitely had                                 disappointments and I'm very cautious                                 with my community engagement now and the                                 reason that I feel positive about the                                 Drupal ladder mostly has to do with its                                 very narrow focus very clearly defined                                 targets goals there are metrics for                                 measuring progress to that goal and                                 there was a lot of work done already                                 when it was presented as an idea so it                                 was more like getting in and helping                                 continue you know it's sort of like that                                 writing the first draft is always hard                                 but then getting people to edit and                                 expand is easier and so there was                                 something in place to jump into rather                                 than let's create this now somebody to                                 read on all that hard work creating the                                 original concept and so to me in terms                                 of what I could give to it I felt like                                 that I can get behind and I feel like                                 you know between                                 Denver and Munich we met our goals and                                 that feels really great and I feel like                                 okay we can set more goals and go for                                 those and I feel like in a lot of the                                 other projects I've been involved in                                 there's there's just not stuff that's                                 that concrete the goals are so big and                                 so far in the future and so massive that                                 there's no and there's no really                                 breaking it down into smaller pieces                                 that Fela jeeva belen three months or                                 two months or something but like they're                                 they're always set up so okay will do                                 this and we'll do that and we'll do this                                 in the you know and I can a year or two                                 tada but that intermediate step isn't                                 necessarily like it's you you you get                                 there but it's not in and of itself                                 meaningful and useful per se it's a step                                 on the way to something that's assuming                                 you even have that which in most                                 projects I've been involved with don't                                 have that at all so that to me is I                                 think probably the biggest thing is is                                 it it's it's really narrowly focused                                 like a lot of people asked about Drupal                                 ladder being used for contraband for                                 lots of other things and that's awesome                                 and ultimately yes and anybody who wants                                 to do that can do that right now that's                                 what not that's not what the center                                 central focus of the project is and I am                                 NOT going to put my energy into anything                                 beyond Drupal core because I need it for                                 my sanity I'm here we also just started                                 a steering committee because Brian                                 started this thing and then Brian's been                                 like oh my god millions of people so                                 Brock Karen and I are now like part of                                 his steering committee and we're looking                                 for other people to get involved and he                                 asked me this a capital camp which is                                 like a month ago if I would be willing                                 to do this and I was like                                 yeah I don't like to sign on the dotted                                 line anymore in the community because I                                 I felt I felt particularly with the doc                                 team lead stuff um I really felt like I                                 mean I felt bad I felt like I let people                                 down you know because it was like I had                                 all these ideas I was trying to work                                  towards them and I just couldn't do it                                  anymore and I had to stop and that was                                  horrible like that was just                                  heart-wrenching and I don't wanna go                                  through that again and so I told him I                                  finally did accept but I told him here                                  the limits two hours a week I only work                                  on lessons and how those lessons the                                  content for the lessons gets created I                                  don't deal with the website I don't deal                                  with the tools for creating the lessons                                  none of it this is what I do and these                                  are the hours I do it in and and again                                  so I feel safe I'm like here's my scope                                  this is what I'm willing to do and he                                  was excited about that and he's actually                                  getting the other steering committee                                  people to do that and I think that                                  that's also probably really important in                                  terms of be able to move a larger                                  project forward and yeah not burning                                  people out but I have not spoken with                                  Lisa Rex about this at all no                                  microphone having this whole thing I                                  know I don't I hope no one feels like                                  just this conversation but just so                                  people know there's actually if you go                                  to the getting involved page and there's                                  a list of community initiatives and that                                  includes of course the core initiatives                                  but other initiatives like organizing                                  the getting involved page and Lisa Rex                                  has actually done a lot of work to try                                  and work this together but there's a lot                                  of knowledge that's sort of stuck in                                  different places I think even Addison                                  did wasn't aware would be great to have                                  that kind of share what actually worked                                  in terms of project management within                                  the community and you probably you could                                  write a book about it you know yeah no                                  that's that's great actually yeah                                  because that is a another larger meta                                  problem yeah um I have to run so I                                  wanted I mean I'm sort of tying together                                  a little bit of you know where are we                                  and what can we do at this point with                                  the analogy to you know are we at the                                  crunchy part where people are still kind                                  of doing stuff one of the things with                                  contribute if there is as established a                                  place and stuff where contribs happen                                  and people going to find them so I think                                  perhaps what we try to you know what we                                  would perhaps be a good thing to do is                                  you alluded to a little bit earlier is                                  for all of us to kind of say okay we are                                  going to go and we were to start in                                  addition to making that list of what's                                  available you know at curriculum and                                  training what's also to say we're going                                  to go and we're going to discuss these                                  things and we're going to work with each                                  other to figure out what's you know                                  because let's keep talking but not wait                                  until cons to do the talking that's and                                  then you know since that's the one place                                  that we seem to have that makes sense                                  let's at least start there and then                                  let's see where it goes you know just                                  start talking and well yeah keep talking                                  is that's that's always the problem we                                  we all get very excited and and then you                                  know you know we're gonna go back home                                  and I have a backlog of a week of work                                  as everybody else does and you                                  I have all these things that we've been                                  put off and what oh right that back                                  community education stuff right right on                                  i'll get to that next week next week in                                  the next week you know so yes the                                  keeping talking thing which is hard i                                  think it's keep you talking and you know                                  we can change your minds laters but                                  let's just kind of agree that that that                                  let's just start trying enough is                                  without too much meta conversation I                                  think because the more we keep talking                                  about it unless we do yeah so the less                                  actually happens awesome thanks okay                                  yeah how many people are going to be at                                  the sprint tomorrow it there's a sprint                                  that's going on I'll community sprained                                  all day tomorrow it's going to be over

people for                                  contributing decor so that'll be linked                                  will be off in a corner doing that and                                  then there's the core sprint which are                                  they're all working on working on core                                  but then there's gonna be lots of other
