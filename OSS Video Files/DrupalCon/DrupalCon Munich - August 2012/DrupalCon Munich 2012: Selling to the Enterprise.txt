Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Large companies have large sales proceses, and selling to these organizations is not a trivial matter. This session introduces you to all of the components in an enterprise sales team, and the processes that are used to do big business. We will discuss how to create a sales funnel from lead generation, qualification of these leads, tools such as discovery letters, and show all of the steps that are taken from initial contact to closing a deal.

You will hear personal introductions from sales personnel in various roles, including Inside Sales, Outside Sales, and Presales.

No, we can't get rid of RFP's, so let's talk about how to do them well, protect yourself from wasting effort on opportunities that can't be won, and knocking out the competition when you do decide to bid.

                       Shaw from aquia we're here today to have                                a conversation with you about enterprise                                sales and to get it started I wanted to                                relate to you a bit of my personal                                experience in Drupal and maybe it                                relates to your experiences as well and                                you can kind of compare and see how much                                we have in common so i started doing                                drupal as an individual programmer and                                had a day job doing java development and                                along the way I learned that there were                                people who wanted to hire me to do                                drupal things build a module make a                                website and eventually I made the jump                                and joined a drupal company and was                                doing it full-time worked for a couple                                of those and in every case it was it was                                the most amazing thing I was following a                                career path that was the stones that on                                the step on the path were being laid                                down by people coming to me and saying                                hey Robert can you build me a an X                                there's a stone on the path and I take                                the step and I'd take the money and you                                know Robert would you like to come and                                work for this company there are people                                asking us to build websites so there was                                the next step and eventually I'd worked                                my way through a number of companies who                                were completely driven by market demand                                okay these were fairly small companies                                and                                                                   larger companies started coming into                                Drupal and larger customers started                                coming into Drupal Acquia formed grease                                first said the elephants are coming the                                elephants came more elephants are coming                                and along the way a lot of people who                                have had similar experiences to my                                experience where we kind of grew up with                                drupal and                                started working with more larger and                                more exciting clients bigger projects                                more complicated projects we've had                                we've had differing experiences actually                                selling and working with very top                                clients so based on spending a year on                                the sales team working with Jim Shaw                                developing the European market for                                aqueous enterprise sales I realized that                                there's a lot to learn about enterprise                                sales but a lot that maybe I could share                                and definitely a lot that Jim can share                                that would be interesting to people who                                have similar experiences to mine or who                                are working at mid-level companies who                                are looking for a larger client base and                                also I think it's very useful just to                                talk about the word enterprise and                                define what it means so our session                                today then has the purpose of breaking                                down what happens in a an enterprise                                sales cycle and looking at some of the                                roles and what they do and the contact                                people that they have in a sales team so                                just so Jim and I understand who we're                                talking to how many of you are actively                                in sales at your company okay mm-hmm                                we're in the right place you came to the                                right session how many of you have more                                than two people selling in your company                                more than five right okay so we're                                talking it's exactly the right audience                                it's exactly perfect it's exactly like I                                thought it's a lot of people who are at                                a mid-level and looking to understand                                what lies above and make decisions about                                that great and there's one more thing                                that I wanted to add another thing that                                I learned by joining a sales team coming                                from a development background was that                                it's not just about bringing business to                                your company so that you can pay the                                 bills and earn money and get rich in all                                 of that it's actually the the process of                                 sales                                 is providing a solution and helping                                 somebody collaboratively helping                                 somebody solve a problem that they have                                 that they can't solve on their own they                                 wouldn't come to you if they could solve                                 the problem on their own and as a person                                 in a sales role you have an amazing                                 enormous opportunity to make a                                 significant material difference in the                                 operations of another person's business                                 in a positive way by doing your job well                                 and I think that was a very key lesson                                 that I wanted to share with you and we                                 have a couple graphics and clips and                                 stuff that make fun of the sales process                                 because it's also the you know the white                                 elephant in the room you know its sales                                 right you know so there sometimes a fun                                 to make fun of the sales team but that's                                 all tongue-in-cheek I'd want you to know                                 from the bottom of my heart I think that                                 the the beginning of a excellent                                 customer experience and the heart of an                                 excellent company lies with the sales                                 team so with that introduction let's                                 jump in one of the topics that Jim and I                                 wanted to address and a question that we                                 wanted to ask as a leading question                                 towards some of the later material is                                 how do organizations by so you need to                                 know how an organization buys before you                                 try to sell to them so I don't know how                                 easy that is to read so I'll read it off                                 to you so Dilbert says I need a sixteen                                 hundred dollar handheld barcode scanner                                 to finish my lab tests and the pointy                                 boss says okay apply for a capital                                 budget variance prepare an RFP get three                                 bids from a team to evaluate the bids                                 and then prepare a purchase order                                 Gilbert says never mind I'll just learn                                 how to read barcodes by sight he says                                 quitter so it's great because right                                 there he outlines the complexity in the                                 middle frame of what we're going to call                                 an enterprise sale you know you have to                                 prepare a budget request bids get at                                 least three bids form a team to evaluate                                 it and then go through a purchase order                                 procurement process it's complicated                                 the type of purchasing experience that I                                 was familiar with when i joined the                                 sales team was more like this there was                                 somebody who knew what they wanted they                                 had a list of requirements that they had                                 written down themselves they called                                 somebody on the phone said hey I think

this checklist                                 sales process and how many of you are                                 comfortable selling to a process like                                 that just does it sound familiar do you                                 get customers coming to you who have                                 basically pre-qualified Drupal                                 pre-select drupal never how many of you                                 deal with the process that's more like                                 this this is how an enterprise buys so                                 they have a process where they've done a                                 needs analysis and RFI and rfp they've                                 got a proposal review committee they've                                 got a selection process that has                                 different teams doing their own                                 checklists their own criteria and                                 finally you know they've got this whole                                 project delivery team that's going to                                 work with how many people okay so good                                 so a lot of you are already dealing with                                 enterprise sales that's great to see                                 that's a great validation of the market                                 that we're in don't speak to the                                 sweetums well so I guess quite often it                                 feels like the process is almost set up                                 to stop anybody selling anything quite                                 often even in the people in the                                 customers side sometimes have to wrestle                                 with this process and they think they're                                 not going to go away you know big                                 organizations have to do a lot of                                 diligence because a lot of people's                                 careers and prospects in that                                 organization depend on a successful                                 selection and making sure that all the                                 stakeholders have a say in that process                                 so these these are a necessary evil the                                 trick is some of the things that we'll                                 talk about shortly is making sure that                                 you follow the process properly making                                 sure that you build the relationships                                 make sure you pick the right ones to                                 engage in and                                 talk about that little ball in a few                                 slice time so in the end of this one the                                 dinosaur is getting revenge on people by                                 saying that you've got two options                                 things that you can't buy the things                                 that you want and can't buy and things                                 that you want and you're not allowed to                                 buy so one of the great the kernel of                                 truth in here is that when you enter a                                 sales process and you're trying to sell                                 to an organization you have to have a                                 deep understanding of what is within the                                 scope of what they wait what they can                                 actually purchase and that goes both                                 ways you don't want to overshoot and try                                 to sell them too much or the wrong                                 product but honestly as a company who's                                 looking out for your own interest and as                                 a sales process that has number to meet                                 you don't want to understood either you                                 don't want to underestimate how much                                 business you can do with a company so a                                 very smart person told me once that his                                 job was to very quickly assess how much                                 money customer was going to be able to                                 pay his company another great thing to                                 think about when you're evaluating                                 whether to sell to the enterprise and                                 how to sell them to the enterprise is to                                 be very aware of how formal the process                                 is so we went through a checklist                                 process and in our food process but                                 knowing that in advance really makes the                                 difference whether you're going to show                                 up like this guy or that guy and also                                 whether they're going to show up with                                 these types of expectations or those                                 types of expectations and having a very                                 deep and intimate understanding of the                                 process that the customer is going to                                 have to go through to get to the point                                 where they can give you money to give                                 them services is very important so some                                 of the more interesting case studies                                 from my time on the Aqua sales team                                 involved national governments where they                                 had legal requirements such as the                                 proposals being written in a language                                 that was not my native language where                                 they had legal requirements about the                                 number of bids and the demographics of                                 the bids where the companies were                                 located and very niche                                 picky requirements about the filing of                                 the actual documents and if you don't                                 know that going in you're going to                                 either fail and waste your time or                                 failing wasting your time and spend a                                 lot of money doing it so be very aware                                 of the formality of any sales process                                 before you get into it and be very aware                                 of course this is for product                                 development but as a sales team really                                 think about what type of solution you                                 want to sell and make sure that you're                                 selling at the right level okay so when                                 you have a solution sometimes the                                 solutions very easy to talk about right                                 sometimes you can say i have x that does                                 this really well it does the job over                                 and over and over again reliably and                                 this is a great example of the product                                 but there are some limitations it cannot                                 do this in that and you have to very                                 clearly make those limitations so you                                 don't see a screwdriver you don't see                                 the toothpick you could try it to use it                                 as a toothpick but it might be dangerous                                 on the other hand you might decide that                                 selling to the enterprise is best done                                 if you offer more tools then it becomes                                 the question are you offering tools that                                 are specialized are you offering tools                                 that are actually best class tools best                                 in their class and can you really                                 honestly say that you have the best                                 screwdriver the most comfortable                                 toothpick you can say that you've got to                                 saw a knife a bottle opener can opener                                 and a screwdriver but are they the best                                 and there are some companies Jim I think                                 you mentioned IBM being one of them                                 where they come to the sales process and                                 they say we've got a sweet they can do                                 everything could possibly ever need yeah                                 I think okay on this one I think is                                 really important Nani to think about                                 what your positioning but in the                                 enterprise sale if you're going to large                                 organizations you also need to think                                 about what everybody else is going to be                                 positioning because these decisions                                 aren't always absolute decisions about                                 your solution they're actually relative                                 decisions they're they're looking for a                                 stack ranking of the people but they've                                 gone to two                                 for the supply this product and your one                                 way of looking at these slides I think                                 it's a great analogy I've lost track of                                 the number of times when this analogy                                 kind of applies to your competitive                                 strategy in a deal okay so if you were                                 if you were competing against a very                                 let's let's make it really relevant to                                 Drupal if you're competing for a CMS                                 platform chase in a large multinational                                 organization they're considering Drupal                                 but they're also considering some                                 proprietary products right so those                                 proprietary products might come from                                 might be one product in a portfolio of                                 erp and integration technologies and CRM                                 technologies and those vendors are very                                 much going to look like they're offering                                 this and and sometimes you have to make                                 a choice to very bravely say this it's                                 like you don't need all that what you                                 need is against your requirement you                                 really need something that's going to do                                 this really well and although a bigger                                 vendor has that it might be mediocre                                 compared to what you can do just in that                                 one area and you know this is the                                 itching strategy right so if you're                                 competing against a mega vendor or a                                 large and another organization lots of                                 capabilities that you don't have you go                                 for a niche strategy to say I'm we're                                 really good at this if this is what you                                 want us to do for you than with the                                 right choice and you put your sales                                 strategy on that if you're competing                                 against somebody who maybe doesn't have                                 some of the things you you can do you                                 think for a flanking strategy you say                                 well we can do exactly what you want and                                 this project you've got in mind in                                    months time we could do that for you too                                 and those two things together would make                                 more sense if you came to us so thinking                                 about your strategy in terms of position                                 your your product not just against the                                 customers need which is always central                                 but also against what the other people                                 are going to be competing for that                                 business is going to be doing is really                                 really critical as well                                 it's the same analogy but from a                                 different point of view and you have to                                 ask yourself before you enter any sales                                 process do you have all the pieces that                                 this customer needs so how big is your                                 company how many developers do you have                                 and if you don't have all the pieces can                                 you partner with other companies to                                 provide the missing pieces what are the                                 missing pieces identifying not only the                                 needs that they've written down but the                                 needs that they might not have thought                                 over the minutes but then they might                                 have in the next year or next couple of                                 years that's going to help you position                                 your company as a solution provider that                                 it doesn't look so much like that but                                 rather you know well that looks a little                                 bit jumbled maybe maybe it would be                                 better visual if it had you know built a                                 house out of it or something but it's                                 actually really difficult and one of the                                 things that we get to presently is                                 having Andrew milk come up on stage and                                 talk about his role as a pre sales                                 engineer and that's one of the points                                 where there's this matching between the                                 needs of the customer and the discovery                                 of the needs of the customer and the                                 actual product portfolio of your company                                 that you're trying to sell to the                                 enterprise and that was actually the the                                 role that I was the most active in at                                 aquia and it's I think that it's one                                 that all of the people here who had                                 those same stepping stones that I had                                 would be familiar with because you're                                 probably very adept at going into a                                 situation and talking about Drupal and                                 spreading the enthusiasm about how                                 flexible it is but I was talking to some                                 people after a sales talk yesterday and                                 they said it's really really easy to go                                 in and talk about Drupal and say hey                                 we've got this box of Lego's but                                 actually talking about that house you                                 know that isn't built in this picture as                                 a full solution and and and matching                                 that to all of the different needs of                                 the customer might actually be important                                 how many of you attended the sales panel                                 yesterday so one of the really                                 key questions I thought that came from                                 that was have you ever managed to go                                 into a pitch and sell your services your                                 drupal based services without actually                                 really talking about Drupal and that's                                 one very good a very good test you can                                 put your to yourself before you walk                                 into any pitch situation or talk to a                                 customer are you selling them Drupal or                                 are you selling them a solution and are                                 you selling the right solution and I                                 think your success will be greater if                                 you aim for selling the solution show                                 them the end game the final product what                                 their success is going to look like in                                 terms that they can understand and                                 relate to and you'll make a sale explain                                 to them how great the hook system is and                                 you'll get their lead engineer excited                                 but nobody else so that was a hard                                 lesson for me to learn in in my selling                                 experience and how many feel you're                                 guilty of that selling the technology                                 and the dream of Drupal rather than a                                 solution so it's somewhat relevant so                                 once you've gone through all of this                                 thought preparation right you know the                                 process you know what you have to offer                                 you know what they're looking for then                                 you can start to you can start to make                                 your decisions about how you're going to                                 actually approach the selling process                                 how many of you have taken the time to                                 write down your sales process like put                                 it on the big board yeah good good how                                 many of you have more than five steps in                                 your process yeah so once you know all                                 that you can decide you can approach the                                 sale like this based on                                 seat-of-the-pants charisma charm and                                 personal acumen it's not that well that                                 pitch is supposed to represent yeah this                                 is this is the charming approach or are                                 you going to take a more collaborated                                 team approach with a longer-term view                                 I think there's a really important point                                 here that only people buy off people                                 right and this one of those really glib                                 things that people say but but it's one                                 of the fundamental truths so you're not                                 going to buy something of somebody if                                 you don't like them if they don't listen                                 to you if they don't come back to you                                 and and and when they say if they don't                                 meet their promises that you have to                                 build relationship you had to build you                                 have to transmit integrity when you're                                 selling even more so in the enterprise                                 because you have more touch points you                                 have to do that with a wider range of                                 people so I'm so sorry for my hilarity                                 of the first one I'm not not sure well                                 this guy could actually be a great                                 salesperson yeah if he reaches out to                                 you and makes a personal connection and                                 has a great deal of integrity i mean the                                 cigar might be a little off-putting i'm                                 not sure what I'd buy off this chair and                                 they might be totally stone cold in the                                 sales process and fail to recognize you                                 as anything except potential revenue so                                 we're going to now get into what I                                 consider the meat of the session here's                                 the the fillet steak so to speak where                                 we take a little bit of a look at the                                 sales cycle and the roles on the sales                                 team that fulfill the different parts of                                 the sales cycle so that was all kind of                                 a preparation orientation for this                                 analysis so for me and I think Jim                                 strongly agrees on this sales comes down                                 to this in volume on this                                 a B C they always BBC closing always be                                 closing probably goes better without                                 Batum in the background funny how that                                 works let's try that again a B C ain't                                 always BBC closing always be closing                                 always be closing how many of you know                                 that moving click I love that movie                                 because it's just the worst caricature                                 of a sales director you'll ever see in                                 your life I actually assigned it as an                                 assignment of my inside team recently                                 just to watch that movie what what what                                 does happen in that movies you start to                                 see some of the very common floors you                                 see in sales people each other each of                                 the sales people that work for Alec be                                 Alec Baldwin character they're all have                                 a floor they are they rely too much on                                 relationship or they dream and believe                                 that someone's going to buy off them                                 even when the signals aren't there and                                 and and there are so many kind of sales                                 oriented sand bites from that i think                                 robert van the n one that didn't have                                 profanity in it so i think he did a good                                 job on that i did and one of the flaws                                 is the the jack lemmon character                                 actually closes a deal to a couple that                                 have no money he didn't qualify the                                 opportunity by finding out that they                                 have a budget so yeah it's great so the                                 sales process we sat down and we kind of                                 went through it in our minds the the                                 over arching steps that we feel are                                 typical in a sales process and the first                                 one lead generation actually falls                                 outside of the sales team altogether so                                 that's a marketing operation to generate                                 the market demand and the information                                 about who is interested in your product                                 to begin with and that's actually the                                 team of the marketing department how                                 many marketing people a taqueria go                                 there must be about                                                  their their full-time job is is creating                                 that sales funnel that then shows up for                                 your team when they come to work in the                                 morning and log into salesforce and                                 you've got your list and then there's                                 the step of contact and discovery                                 somebody has to reach out to the people                                 who have been identified as being                                 interested in the product from all of                                 the people that you contact you have to                                 identify the opportunities then you                                 after you've established that contact                                 confirmed that there's an opportunity                                 there then you go through a scoping                                 process that's where you're you know                                 finding out what kind of Swiss Army                                 knife or box of Lego's is going to be                                 the right one you get two proposals you                                 work on generating by in on those                                 proposals there's a process of                                 commitment and contractual and then the                                 sales process actually extends beyond                                 that into what we just lumped into post                                 sales but that's something that is very                                 much about account management and                                 customer check ups like the you know                                 how's the project going and you know are                                 there new things on your radar and                                 looking for upsell cross-sell and                                 extension opportunities to make sure                                 that your customer of today is going to                                 be your customer of tomorrow as well so                                 I think I'll go through these fairly                                 quickly i just put together a series of                                 graphics to speak to each of those                                 that's the sales funnel that's your                                 company creating such a magnetic                                 presence that you attract contact to the                                 customers that want to possibly engage                                 you and then in the ideal world you have                                 got a very nice and cheerful and                                 friendly group of people reaching out to                                 them through the phone or in person and                                 making that contact from those and                                 here's one of the very key points where                                 actual deep sales skill comes in in that                                 initial contact how do you go about                                 uncovering the diamond in the rough the                                 gem amongst the rocks and and and saying                                 that this is an opportunity                                 if your marketing team is doing a great                                 job they're going to have so many leads                                 that you can't get through them all and                                 in Drupal honestly that should be the                                 case right now because it's a market                                 that's fairly on fire it's a growing                                 market and if you're lucky then you've                                 got more contexts like after drupalcon                                 you're going to come up with a stack of                                 business cards right I mean you're doing                                 the meet and greet and shaking hands                                 with in exchanging business cards are                                 you going to call all these people and                                 how are you going to figure out what                                 those which opportunities to actually                                 invest time into so some of the triggers                                 that are important are is Drupal as an                                 option or are they really actually                                 interested in something that Drupal                                 can't or shouldn't be doing is there a                                 budget do they have a timeline and a                                 deadline that is going to create enough                                 pressure for them that they have to come                                 to a decision in a reasonable amount of                                 time or are they thinking about three                                 years in the future which case you                                 should be talking to them right now so                                 the sales word for thats qualification                                 qualification so the answer kind of                                 picking out of the opportunities you see                                 things on there's lots of lots of                                 methodologies for this you'll find out                                 there on the web the most common one is                                 some was an IBM and methodological band                                 so budget Authority need timeline so if                                 you can find all of those things in your                                 leader opportunity then it's probably                                 something that has legs and something                                 you should spend more time or you can                                 fail in your sales process at a much                                 later time in any one of those later                                 steps after expending a lot of time and                                 effort and sometimes even a lot of money                                 if you don't do this step correctly and                                 then this is the contact so this is                                 something that's easy to get your head                                 around easy to think about but if you                                 don't get out there and actually meet                                 the people you're selling to in person                                 then you're I've been granted it's a big                                 enough opportunity to justify it right                                 but i think you know that's we're                                 talking about slang to the enterprise so                                 it would almost certainly fit that if                                 you don't actually get out and make that                                 personal relationship it's much harder                                 to sell so jim mentioned earlier                                 remember that you're selling to a purse                                 not a company or an entity or a group of                                 people really make it an individual                                 experience and you can't do that unless                                 you actually travel out and and spend                                 the time getting into the head of the                                 person that you're selling to and try                                 and understand what they need and so                                 again Andrew one of Andrews jobs when he                                 comes on stage and one of my jobs during                                 the time that I was on the sales team                                 was travelling around in region in the                                 regions that we were involved in selling                                 and actually making house calls to                                 customers and that was actually a lot of                                 fun in a lot of cases because if you                                 hear somebody described a website that                                 they want to build on the phone a lot of                                 times it's like oh yeah another website                                 but if you actually go and see them in                                 the context of their business and what                                 they're trying to do and meet their team                                 and see the the passion and the need and                                 the opportunity in their eyes and from                                 their point of view then it makes it                                 easier for you to buy and and you know                                 make an internal commitment to helping                                 them have that success then solution                                 scoping this is what I know you're all                                 familiar with because at some point you                                 have to plan what kind of site to build                                 but there's a lot of opportunity at this                                 point for creativity and finding ways to                                 either reduce the scope of their project                                 or increase the reach of what you're                                 able to offer through either creative                                 commitments of your own resource or                                 acquiring resource through partnerships                                 or finding ways to decouple their needs                                 all together so that you can come up                                 with a solution that you can convey to                                 them and get it into their mind what it                                 is that they're going to have at the end                                 of the day finally the sales process                                 then leads to a proposal and you want                                 them to say yes so this is often                                 manifests itself in the form of a formal                                 pitch oftentimes a company will try to                                 have a pitch period where they have a                                 day or a couple of days where all of the                                 the suitors the contenders come in                                 and present what they have and that                                 gives them hopefully the continuity and                                 the consistency to compare apples to                                 apples because they see one they say the                                 next and they can think which one do I                                 actually believe can solve my needs the                                 best pitch is fairly important you can                                 very easily go from underdog to winner                                 or preferred position to has been in the                                 course of the pitch one of the most                                 important things that I've learned about                                 pitching is that you're going to be                                 talking to several people in the room                                 and they're all people with their own                                 needs in the process and if you don't                                 understand what those needs are and if                                 you don't speak to them individually and                                 answer the questions that they have from                                 their point of view then you're not                                 going to get buy-in from them that's                                 actually a really really really hard                                 thing to do to orchestrate in advance                                 why is it hard they might not tell you                                 who's in the room you might not know                                 going in who's going to be in the room                                 you might have prepared yourself with a                                 list of names that you expect and then                                 you count and there's one extra person                                 what do you do you know how do you adapt                                 in the moment to make sure that this                                 person isn't that you know the dark                                 horse who's going to have the actual say                                 over whether or not you get chosen so                                 you have to be flexible and engage in                                 you know making a personal relationship                                 to that person in a matter of seconds                                 and quickly assessing whether or not                                 that's a decision maker whether or not                                 they have anything to say at the table                                 and whether you should be crafting your                                 message to to what they need to hear and                                 understanding what it is that they need                                 to hear what what is what's their skin                                 in the game so to speak in Jim and I are                                 in a couple situations where there were                                 unexpected people and well I think                                 there's also a really good phrase to                                 remember and unity is good at the sales                                 process as you are delivering a project                                 or delivering a Drupal project and you                                 don't like surprises in projects right                                 don't like the scope to suddenly change                                 in the last minute or some of these say                                 I'm not signing that off and you've                                 never heard of it before it's the same                                 in sales process you have surprises if a                                 bird                                 days not for sales processes so if you                                 get surprised like that means you've                                 missed something it means you missed                                 something early in the process of course                                 things will always go wrong but you can                                 minimize that you know hardly the work                                 how do you work at that a few surprises                                 you're going to have in the process so                                 you get to the proposal you work on by                                 and you work through the objections that                                 they might have you provide them with                                 follow-up information you continue to                                 show them that you are going to deliver                                 for them and hopefully come to a                                 signature your sales process goes past                                 the signed contract so even when your                                 team is delivering the project there's                                 stuff that you can do as a sales team to                                 make it more successful sometimes the                                 project team is talking to their                                 engineering team but not the                                 stakeholders and the stakeholders might                                 have a different perception of the how                                 the how the projects going then then the                                 engineers in the company have so you as                                 a sales team have an opportunity to get                                 a different type of feedback about the                                 project and the way it's going then the                                 actual engineers might so stay involved                                 so maybe just a quick questions is there                                 anything on that list that looks wrong                                 hands up as the Zen thing is there                                 anything missing yeah I mean this                                 doesn't say how long we're short each                                 phase is right or how much resource you                                 have to put in its but this is step you                                 have to go through I've seen a lot of                                 sick people put sales processes on slice                                 in my time and this they always follow                                 this kind of face you know fine find the                                 people who like to buy a few make                                 contact with them qualify the                                 opportunities work out what the solution                                 is they're going to you could sell them                                 that they have a need for make sure they                                 understand what you can do get buy-in                                 get in Tucson contract and deliver it                                 for them that's kind of the process well                                 the key things about that process though                                 is you don't want to skip steps okay so                                 we all have our comfort zone in that                                 process you know as as Drupal asst you                                 know that that passion about discussing                                 the solution and what that's going to                                 look like is probably a an easy time to                                 just easy thing to justify spending time                                 on but if you haven't qualified them yet                                 if you haven't figured out they got a                                 budget nor an authority or a need or a                                 timeline then all that all that time                                 you're going to spend on the scoping                                 which can can be significant you might                                 be spending that be you then get to the                                 end of that and they go wow it'd be                                 fantastic if we have that solution Shane                                 we haven't got any money for two years                                 yeah so it's important not to not to                                 skip steps so I think the next step next                                 slide is is me talking about sales team                                 so and just a quick show of hands how                                 many people have more than I know two                                 roles in their sales teams the people                                 who do sales for the organization okay                                 how many people have more than three                                 roles in their sales team okay so when                                 you're selling to larger organizations                                 you have to talk to more people when                                 you're selling smaller projects or                                 smaller organizations you're probably                                 going to do you might have one person to                                 all all those steps in the process do                                 all the scoping through all the                                 qualifying through the closing do the                                 contracts and do the delivery in a large                                 organization there's going to be more                                 people involved and that's one of the                                 reasons why a clearly structured that                                 sales team in a particular way so Robert                                 if you minute I will be under the money                                 or amusing videos to start off with just                                 two yeah absolutely so if you want to                                 know the sales team and the different                                 roles then this is a great place                                 hi dr. Jacobs this is chris marlon over                                 at JT more might be might be doesn't                                 sell stock at the rate embassies going                                 for a dr.

    watch your colleagues get rich doing                                 clinical trials and don't buy a shirt                                 hang up the phone honestly doc I don't                                 have the time this stock is blowing up                                 right now the whole firms going nuts                                 hold on let me open up the door to my                                 office see that that's my training for                                 now I have a million calls to make to a                                 million other doctors who are already in                                 the note I'm sorry tier office or your                                 mansion let me put my secretary on and                                 she'll take down your info there's a                                 pleasure doing business with you done                                 and done so that's the way it works                                 really don't know what was more shocking                                 to me about that clip whether it's been                                 diesel doing a very sophisticated kind                                 of sales job or pressure sales job on                                 somebody all the fact that Robert                                 managed to find out that's not a movie                                 that I unfamiliar with sir but it's                                 called boiler room boiler room yeah so                                 interesting movie anyway and we the show                                 of hands was interesting because I think                                 when you're selling to the enterprise                                 there are many more many more                                 stakeholders to deal with so you know                                 the reason why they have those long RFP                                 process is because there's many people                                 that need to be happy with the choices                                 and no success is determined by being                                 making the right choice this is this is                                 how we boil boil boil out via the rolls                                 in in the aqueous sales team so we have                                 we have salespeople some                                 inside sales people some of them are                                 externals people were probably here from                                 one of my insight team shortly on video                                 you may well have met some of my                                 external sales team that they're all                                 here the drupalcon people had Peter                                 Walsh it looks half the UK for me                                 Wilfred harvest looks after the Benelux                                 and Nordics and so a Reinhard who looks                                 after France and southern Europe their                                 job is really to own the whole execution                                 it you know they their star rises and                                 falls on the amount of revenue that they                                 bring in against their target that's                                 that's their job but they can't do it on                                 their own that we don't employ them for                                 their technical acumen we employ them                                 because they're really good at executing                                 a sales process they're really good at                                 understanding who the people are they're                                 going to help make the decision who the                                 people how they're going to make that                                 decision internally what the criteria                                 that we're going to be successful if                                 competing against a competitors and                                 those opportunities so we employ pre                                 sales and sales engineers so technical                                 experts who can go in and meet with the                                 technical stakeholders in the enter in                                 the enterprise customer they were                                 talking to so quite often will will                                 spend time in architecture team or                                 project team or digital team helping                                 them understand what this we can do for                                 them a sales director so you know in in                                 all situations like this there are                                 hierarchies inside the organization so                                 yeah when the day-to-day contact for the                                 sales guy is going to have a boss and                                 you can have a boss's boss who also has                                 a stake who may actually be the ndn                                 signatory on the deal so we also have                                 other people other roles that get                                 involved in the cell a sales director                                 who runs the sales team and an executive                                 sponsor so it's good to present when you                                 have your CEO in the room I'm Tom over                                 there is it an exec sponsor on some of                                 my accounts we do that lack we Ariza how                                 our customers understand the commitment                                 we have to customer success and also to                                 ensure there's some longevity and some                                 executives executive commitment to what                                 we're going to do for that customer you                                 know larger organizations are making                                 bigger more critical decisions so yeah                                 when a large pharmaceutical company                                 decides to go Drupal and to use some of                                 our products to do that and we had Tom                                 we had dress we had members of Apple it                                 marketing team go and meet with the                                 various                                 executives inside of that organization                                 to ensure that they had the connection                                 to the people that they were actually                                 making the deal with because it was the                                 piece that people in had company they're                                 going to make that a success and then                                 once we got the sign we also have a                                 process whereby because that model is                                 renewable you know the support and                                 hosting is kind of the key thing that we                                 want to be driving from our business                                 model and having having that renew                                 year-on-year is very very important to                                 us as well so we have a function which                                 is a camp management to make sure we                                 look after those customers at post-sale                                 once the contract is signed so now we're

spent on the phone with customers                                 clients prospects partners talking them                                 about their projects learning about                                 their challenges coordinating with                                 partners but then also a lot of time                                 internally talking to different members                                 of our team coordinating resources                                 writing proposals etc there's a couple                                 skills that are there pretty important I                                 mean one you need to be a people person                                 and enjoy talking to people in making                                 relationships and building those                                 relationships over time but you do that                                 over and over again and of course the                                 day sometimes you know give                                              conversations so you need to be well                                 organized and you need to be able to                                 manage your time pretty effectively but                                  you also need to be able to you know be                                  a leader and be able to guide someone                                  through a process whether that's                                  guidance                                  through validating the right technology                                  choice or the right solution whatever it                                  is even helping people and cover you                                  know what they need to do one on their                                  side to get a deal done because                                  sometimes that that process of                                  contracting for a new service is unknown                                  so you could be quite inquisitive in                                  terms of the questions that you ask and                                  figuring out you know how to how to help                                  someone get to the right and endgame                                  actually I'm going to cut Alex short                                  because we're running short on time and                                  I want to make sure we get a chance to                                  do some Q&A at the end I've done just                                  one quick observation in in the short                                  clip that we did see from Alex you'll                                  notice he talked a lot about what the                                  customer need was you know we spend a                                  lot of time with our inside team just                                  talking to the to the people that come                                  to us the leads that come in that                                  direction and just trying to understand                                  what it is that's going to make it make                                  sense for them to use our products it                                  was the need that's going to drive that                                  and that's kind of one of the key                                  functions that are inside team does for                                  us he was trying to filter those least                                  qualify those so we work very hard at                                  that and I will paraphrase Alex one of                                  the things that he said went in his                                  later question what's your favorite part                                  of the job he answered that one of his                                  favorite parts the job is actually                                  learning all of the things that people                                  are doing with Drupal it's an amazing                                  diversity out there all of the different                                  business models and products and types                                  of websites that people are using Drupal                                  for and alex is great at his job in part                                  because he's deeply interested in every                                  one of those business models and how                                  they're doing it and he's actually an                                  intrapreneur himself at heart and i'm                                  sure will eventually go on to be a part                                  of building his own company because he's                                  deeply genuinely interested in what the                                  people are doing with the technology and                                  that shows every time that was actually                                  a second thing he says to the answer to                                  that question the first one was a beer                                  at the end of the week yeah he said that                                  his favorite part of the job was getting                                  done getting to the end of the week                                  after a long weekend having a nice beer                                  but I guess we can relate to that so the                                  next person of the sales team that we'd                                  like to call to the stage of this is                                  andrew milk and he's one of the pre                                  sales engineers yeah so i mean i can                                  start by telling a bit about what my                                  role and responsibilities in the sales                                  process i'll i do pre-sales so that                                  means i do the technical scoping and                                  understanding what people's actual needs                                  are in terms of their projects that can                                  be people who've already got drupal                                  experience who are already using Drupal                                  or people who haven't yet made the leap                                  to Drupal so it's actually understanding                                  how what people are expecting to do and                                  what they want to do on their websites                                  and the challenges that they might be                                  facing so it might be performance                                  challenges security that kind of thing                                  in terms of my daily activities that                                  really splits down the line between                                  whether I'm working in the office which                                  is generally a question of being on the                                  phone a lot also supporting our sales                                  team in terms of actually being on calls                                  with customers or with prospects                                  providing those those people with demos                                  also of what a queer does but also of                                  what Drupal can do so that's the one                                  side the other side is actually then                                  being on site for example with our sales                                  executives whether that is in the UK in                                  benelux or elsewhere in Europe so that's                                  obviously a very different kind of                                  experience and has rob said before I                                  think it's also one of the most                                  satisfying in interesting parts of the                                  job because you really get to see how                                  people work with Drupal or how what                                  their real issues are in terms of                                  working with perhaps you know like a                                  multilingual setup where they've got an                                  end to end implementation that requires                                  maybe you know                                                            of thing so that really can help in                                  terms of key skills obviously primarily                                  I need to understand my company's                                  products but also the Drupal                                  a Drupal product and Drupal itself in                                  addition to that I think it's really                                  about communication it's about being                                  able to listen firstly secondly to be                                  able to ask the right questions and then                                  also to be able to articulate answers                                  and ideas about how things can actually                                  be moved forward whether by Acquia or by                                  other companies and it's also in that                                  case also the ability to say no and no                                  when you can offer the right thing and                                  or whether maybe they will need to go                                  and look at look at something else or                                  work with someone else the people I work                                  with in the sales team is our as we                                  thought Alex I work with so inside sales                                  I work with them a lot on the phone and                                  then of course also with the outbound                                  sales team actually joining them and                                  sometimes having hair-raising car                                  journeys through benelux especially                                  wilford's not here but he'll understand                                  the joke and in terms of the sales                                  process and what I don't do I don't own                                  the process I don't actually I'm not the                                  guy who moves it from one step to the                                  next I'm pulled in to help with the                                  actual scoping the technical                                  requirements to get technical closure as                                  in actually being able to talk to the                                  people in the team who want to                                  understand whether what we can offer is                                  the right thing for them and finally my                                  favorite part of the job well I think                                  there are two there one of it one is                                  actually when a deal is closed and when                                  you know that you've really helped                                  someone not just to hit their number but                                  actually make sure that you've that                                  they've action that we're providing a                                  solution of some kind and the second                                  part is when you actually connect with                                  the people that you're working with or                                  the you're talking to with a potential                                  customer and where you actually know                                  that the information that you've got                                  over to them is something that's really                                  hit home that really make sure that                                  you've connected and that they                                  understand what you want to do and how                                  you can help them I think                                  excellent so we're going to skip the                                  next bit that we had planned because                                  we're short on time if you have                                  questions about rfis rfps of proofs of                                  concept and the thinking that goes and                                  around that then if you find Gemma                                  myself after the after the show would be                                  happy to talk to you just a couple more                                  slides of anecdotes on what makes real                                  great success first of all you have to                                  be a great listener Alex seta Andrew                                  said it Jim said it basically every role                                  on the sales team has to be able to very                                  carefully listen to what's being said to                                  them know to ask the questions to hear                                  more and ask the right questions to get                                  the right information so that you can                                  make all those pieces fit you literally                                  have to get inside the mind of the                                  customer so that you can see yourself                                  and your solution from their point of                                  view and make sure that neither you nor                                  they are forgetting any important part                                  or detail of the whole process yeah i                                  mean just one comment on this and i                                  actually often use the work the phrase                                  mind meld with my team is like have we                                  done the mind-meld with them and we                                  really got inside the head do we did                                  they do they understand that we                                  understand the beach understand each                                  other you know it's important because                                  that's where the relationship and where                                  the trust comes from and I think another                                  aspect another way of thinking about                                  that is in your sales process you're                                  going to with enterprise organizations                                  you're going to encounter many people in                                  many roles it's really important to be                                  clear about what their role is in the                                  process there are people who will be                                  able to say no to your solution and                                  there'll be many many of those you'll be                                  trusted in front of technical people say                                  like does it do this does it have this                                  widget is it this shiny I'll ask those                                  questions and if you say if you give the                                  wrong answer they'll be able to say no                                  you're not the right solution for us but                                  it's probably anyone maybe maybe if                                  you're lucky there might be two people                                  can actually say yes to use the supplier                                  for that particular requirement and                                  understanding of the difference between                                  those two is really important because if                                  you're only talking to the people you                                  can say no you have no relationship with                                  the person who can say yes to your                                  proposition and that's that's kind of a                                  keeping to trying when you're feeling                                  optimistic about about your your deal                                  there are two danger points                                    salespeople when you're feeling really                                  bad about your they're really really                                  extremely bad about your deal or when                                  you're feeling really really really                                  optimistic about your deal both of those                                  are warning signs the signs you bother                                  miss something or you're feeling to                                  secure about your deal or somebody's                                  telling you something that you want to                                  hear but maybe not the challenges the                                  risks are says really such a real deal                                  yeah the best sales people I know are                                  always there bet their own devil's                                  advocate it's not work what basis are                                  not covers am I talking to the people                                  that can say yes do they have budget all                                  those sorts of questions and I think                                  maybe one thought to leave you with                                  before we go into Q&A if we have time                                  December the understand what i mean by                                  conversion rate of kind of your                                  opportunities the things you find two                                  deals yeah how many people are happy                                  with their conversion rate how many                                  people are unhappy with their conversion                                  rate now expecting more hands this is a                                  really important thing it's really                                  important to know how you feel about                                  that you know that's the thing that's                                  going to drive you to change your sales                                  practice to become better at it become                                  more effective at it you know I am last                                  year and running at the beginning of                                  this year might even spend a very large                                  amount of time with one end price                                  prospect was a very formal process I                                  then even add up the number of hours we                                  spent on that it was a very large                                  opportunity it was a very nice name it                                  was one of those ones where you kind of                                  think well if we don't go for it we                                  might have missed a really good                                  opportunity I found that recently we                                  finished second yeah I'm really unhappy                                  about that I know if I do the analysis                                  on the deal it was probably a deal we                                  never released with a chance of winning                                  and that's kind of leads me the kind of                                  final thought I wanted to leave you with                                  in sales there are only two types of                                  deals you don't win the ones you never                                  stood a chance of winning in the first                                  place okay so you didn't qualify the                                  beginning of your process well enough                                  and the second one is the ones you                                  didn't execute well on okay                                  and if you can kind of think about your                                  conversion rate the deals you lose in                                  that way you can probably qualify better                                  and you can execute better so great so                                  we have time for two maybe three                                  questions so go ahead phrase your hands                                  on your first yes                                  so there was a slide that had a diamond                                  in the middle of the rocks so the idea                                  of that is that you get a whole bunch of                                  leads coming into your organization                                  these are people who are potentially                                  interested in your product you have to                                  qualify every one of those and depending                                  on how well you uncover the truth about                                  these leads and convert them into actual                                  opportunities then you're doing a good                                  or a bad job of picking out the diamond                                  from among the rocks so what are the                                  mistakes in the pre sales process that                                  can affect the result of identifying the                                  right opportunities let's let's answer                                  that one first or let's visit sorry in                                  the Drupal context and I guess one that                                  will the key criteria for us is when we                                  come across an opportunity one of the                                  first things we ask is have you already                                  decided to use Drupal now we get a lot                                  of people coming to us to research and                                  find out about Drupal they're not                                  they're not actually planning an active                                  project red flag maybe I maybe I want to                                  help them but there's not not not a                                  near-term opportunity there also you                                  know our solutions that we are                                  predicated on Drupal as i'm sure this                                  case for most people in the room here if                                  they're not going if they're not using                                  Drupal our solutions are not relevant to                                  them so it's a really good way of                                  qualifying then then we so if they're                                  not using Drupal we then kind of look at                                  what's the use case what's the real need                                  for them what were they trying to do so                                  let's think of a good example it's might                                  be better by anecdote so there's a telco                                  in Europe that came to us with a kind of                                  short-term need for hosting and support                                  around the Drupal site it was for their                                  online shop and they they weren't sure                                  whether they're going to use they knew                                  that they were using Drupal for their                                  project right now but they didn't know                                  if they were going to be using Drupal                                  longer term it was really just a short                                  term need so one of the things we had to                                  do in that process was figure out okay                                  well what                                  is the long-term need what's the vision                                  for the web that he shop is going to go                                  and and we also identified the alternate                                  solutions for that and Andrew was                                  actually the pre sales guy on that and                                  did a fantastic job of kind of showing                                  them real time so we did we got the the                                  requirements from them and then we                                  demonstrated to them that they would do                                  what they wanted to do and then we use                                  that sponsors in the organization to                                  kind of transmit that message to the                                  people who could say no right so we had                                  to get them to not say no to allow the                                  solution to become the platform and now                                  that particular companies made the                                  choice that it is the platform trooper                                  will be the platform that they build out                                  all their e-commerce initiatives on                                  which is a phenomenal them they're a                                  multinational telco organization which                                  is a great situation to be in so I                                  probably talked around that a little bit                                  but does that give you an idea of the                                  kind of examples yeah I mean yo peace                                  I've got I've got a screwdriver I'm

                                 for one more question yes sir                                  and I think for us a technical was not                                  trying to make that though the question                                  was how technical are the these roles                                  yeah how much technical knowledge do                                  they have and speaking for myself I have                                  a technical backgrounds I'm an engineer                                  by training I've a master's in                                  electrical electronic engineering with a                                  high software component to that I                                  started off as a I was kogo I probably                                  won't tell you what language it was                                  because that might betray my age but                                  I've been a technical architect up in                                  the business analyst up in the project                                  manager program manager business manager                                  sales person account manager pre sales                                  person I'm alliance manager I've done a                                  wide variety of roles but the                                  commonality in my success has always                                  been able to understand solutions and                                  and kind of make solutions communicable                                  to the people looking for those a Tom                                  will nod or shake his head whether that                                  was a factor in him employing me I                                  believe it was I believe they're having                                  that that kind of background is                                  important what was the most important                                  this passion for what we're doing you                                  know you can't you can't substitute for                                  that so one of things we look for in the                                  people we put into all of these roles                                  just they really excited to get out of                                  bed to go and do their role in this                                  process whether it's to talk to                                     people on the phone                                                      want to talk to you yeah going in and                                  sitting in a room full of                                                and being grilled for three hours about                                  Drupal security it's not not something                                  excites me I have done that in the past                                  about other products Andrew says he                                  loves it you know this is exactly that                                  exactly his cup of tea and I think a                                  technical appreciators it is essential                                  and again some of the best sales guys                                  I've seen are the people who actually                                  have a very intimate understanding of                                  what the solution can do and can match                                  that to the need to the business need                                  inside there inside the prospect okay                                  I'd like to elaborate on there just a                                  little bit most of the inside sales are                                  not technical but a few of them have a                                  talk we at least have taken deep                                  interests in Drupal and one guy                                  the Burlington office runs a kite                                  surfing web site that he's been able to                                  take national and he runs it on Drupal                                  and for the whole first couple years he                                  worked there he was always walking back                                  and forth between the sales department                                  and the support department saying you                                  know when i'm doing views filters if I                                  put this argument in there can I sort on                                  that and the support guys were like who                                  are you and what department are you in                                  but he learned how to build Drupal sites                                  and that has been a key asset and we                                  mentioned wolford harbors who's here at                                  the conference he's a regional director                                  for benelux had never heard of Drupal                                  before taking the job more or less but                                  he won a national coding competition as                                  a young kid so also very technical so                                  the technical skills never hurt okay                                  we're out of time thank you very much                                  for coming and thank you Jim for joining
