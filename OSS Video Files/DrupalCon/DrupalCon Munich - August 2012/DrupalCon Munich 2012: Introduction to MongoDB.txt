Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Introduction to MongoDB
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	This talk introduces MongoDB and provides an introduction of how to get the
most out of MongoDB.

One of the challenges that comes with moving to MongoDB is figuring how to best
model your data. While most developers have internalized the rules of thumb for
designing schemas for RDBMSs, these rules don't always apply to MongoDB. The
simple fact that documents can represent rich, schema-free data structures
means that we have a lot of viable alternatives to the standard, normalized,
relational model.

Not only that, MongoDB has several unique features, such as
atomic updates and indexed array keys, that greatly influence the kinds of
schemas that make sense.

In this session, I'll answer these questions and more, provide a number of data
modeling rules of thumb, and discuss the tradeoffs of various data modeling
strategies. I will also provide information on MongoDB's strong points, such as
scalability and performance.
