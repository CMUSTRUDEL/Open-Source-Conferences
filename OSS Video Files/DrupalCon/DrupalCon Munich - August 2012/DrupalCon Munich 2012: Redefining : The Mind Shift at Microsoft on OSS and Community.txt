Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Redefining : The Mind Shift at Microsoft on OSS and Community
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	This session is a case study of open source's disruptive nature and how it changed business models of large technology companies like Microsoft.

As a large company it can be easy to become insular. Come and learn about the journey Microsoft has been on with Open Source in general, how that's changed our practices and even really our DNA. Because of Open Source, we're in an ongoing culture shift as so many companies, small and large are. We'll explain how and why Open Source changed our approach, share our lessons over the years and show how Microsoft has Opened Up as a response to Open Source. We'll also talk specifically about the power we see Drupal having in the marketplace, which led us to Open Up to Drupal as well.

In this session you will learn:

What led Microsoft to become more open
Why did Microsoft choose to open up specifically to Drupal?
How Microsoft has become more open
Lessons learned before and during the time Microsoft opened up
What has changed at Microsoft because of open source momentum
How we connect the dots between you and customers on our platform (what does it mean for Drupal and Drupal businesses having Microsoft and other large companies open up)

            covers this area all of us actually                                focus on open source that may or may not                                be surprised to some of you guys but we                                actually have hundreds thousands of                                people Microsoft that do something with                                open source in the company worldwide as                                the company we actually are very                                committed to openness and we demonstrate                                that in three very specific ways we                                really have a commitment around playing                                well with others and we do that by being                                involved regularly in standards by                                really being involved in making sure                                that                                open source technologies work with our                                technology as well we listen very                                carefully to a customer's and as a                                result we look at ways to combine our                                technologies with other technologies to                                ensure that we're providing innovative                                solutions that are cost effective for                                them and efficient and we are open in                                the cloud rope in the cloud today you                                can actually develop on Azure which is                                our cloud platform and use Java you can                                use Python you can use PHP you can use                                nodejs today on Azure and Mark is going                                to be talking in a little bit here about                                more specific things that we're enabling                                with open source project on Azure so I'm                                going to take a minute here to talk a                                little bit more about how we're                                investing in standards what we're doing                                with embracing an abling these open                                source projects this may come as a                                surprise to some of you guys but                                Microsoft has actually been involved in                                standards work for over                                             today we're actually part of                                    official standards organizations and                                part of                                                             that because we see that as a critical                                and essential way that we enable                                interoperability with other projects                                with other open source projects and                                other technologies and that is because                                we all want happy customers no single                                vendor can possibly offer all of the                                solutions as single customers in a                                complex environment might need and so we                                do that so that we have a happy customer                                that can use any device connected to any                                system and have it work the way that                                they expect few other factoids about the                                stuff we've been doing with open source                                in a single year because of all the work                                we're doing to enable these open source                                projects in our platform we had four                                hundred percent growth just in a single                                year alone so we have over                                        projects that's zero scoot it over on                                marks Mac sorry                                and that's during the                                                   fifty dollars is                                                      working on Windows                                                    source projects actually work in our                                 platform codeplex some of you may or may                                 not be familiar with is one of the open                                 source communities that we've been                                 fostering that continues to grow with                                 numbers of open source projects that we                                 and other people in the community                                 continued to contribute and we have

           listing of many of the web applications                                 that also work on our platform and we                                 have well over five million downloads                                 their senses and inception over three                                 years ago one of those actually two of                                 those popular applications that's being                                 downloaded is Acquia Drupal is packaged                                 and the second game commerce kickstart                                 and I'll mention

talk more about how we're involved                                 with open source and our product groups                                 and how we're enabling those mark right                                 thanks grace so I think everybody kind                                 of remembers the famous you know Linux                                 is a cancer comment that are famous CEO                                 made some years ago well that was                                 something that stands out in the news                                 and certainly stands out in people's                                 mind it actually internally a Microsoft                                 was something of a watershed event as a                                 lot of people who have been up the                                 company for a lot of years actually you                                 know we're involved with the open source                                 community and understood open source for                                 what it really is rather than what the                                 perceptions were internally among the                                 leadership of the time I mean and one of                                 the big things that kind of fell out of                                 that was for us to really organize                                 around open source technologies into                                 work to try to integrate and                                 interoperate with them and one of those                                 things was the creation of our open                                 source technology center and through                                 that technology center we basically                                 hired a lot of Linux developers and                                 low-level developers to try and work                                 with linux and then try and work to                                 interoperate with linux and other open                                 source technologies some of the things                                 you'll see out of that or have seen out                                 of that is a lot of contributions we've                                 been giving to                                 linux in fact microsoft now is one of                                 the top contributors to the Linux kernel                                 and we provide drivers for linux and                                 also provide integration with our                                 hyper-v virtualization technology one of                                 the other big contributions that came                                 out of that group was contributions to                                 PHP beginning with version php                                        microsoft and along with guys like                                 Pierre joy who was up here in the                                 session just beforehand along with a lot                                 of other PHP core contributors                                 essentially took and rewrote all of PHP                                 and then created a build for windows in                                 there so a lot of PHP and of course the                                 legacy for PHP is on UNIX and of course                                 win                                                                libraries work a little differently we                                 wanted to make PHP work really well on                                 Windows and so instead of maintaining a                                 consistent codebase we decided we'd                                 maintain consistent api's and then                                 optimize the source code underneath and                                 optimize that for for windows and a lot                                 of that had to do with a lot of file i/o                                 and some other stuff involved in there                                 the result you get now is essentially                                 parity for PHP running on Windows as you                                 would get on UNIX or Linux what else if                                 I got in there oh and that other stuff                                 around samba I think everybody's aware                                 with our contributions and work with                                 those guys as well yeah next slide yeah                                 Brian you want to talk a little bit                                 about a sequel server and the work you                                 guys have done put me on the spot here                                 sure why not okay so one of the towards                                 towards making sure PHP not only runs                                 well on sequel server but that you have                                 a full range of functionality that you                                 would expect from PHP running on running                                 on Windows we put a lot of work into a                                 PHP driver for sequel server that is an                                 open source project yeah it's it's on I                                 think it's now on github it used to be                                 on codeplex but we've recently moved it                                 to get up what the biggest requests that                                 we've had for for that driver I mean                                 we've had lots of little requests and                                 we've tried to implement those but the                                 biggest single biggest requests that                                 we've had has been that it that                                 it runs on PHP running on Linux right so                                 that you can have sequel server access                                 from PHP on Linux I we recently released                                 the anode ease odbc driver for Linux a                                 sequel server odbc driver for Linux and                                 if you put two and two together you can                                 set it kind of see that since our our                                 PHP driver now sits on top of oddi bcap                                 eyes on Windows it's not going to be too                                 long before that scenario is is enabled                                 some of the other stuff we've been                                 working on certainly around our web                                 platform and around particularly our is                                 product is used to be pretty awful                                 frankly as a web server back in the eye                                 as five and six days that largely                                 changed with is-                                                       just chucked a lot of it and rewrote                                 most of that from scratch fast cgi are                                 implementing fat cgi and our platform to                                 host PHP applications was a part of that                                 a lot of the other work that went into                                 making it better though we're a lot of a                                 lot of code we wrote that we actually                                 ended up just open sourcing in general                                 win cash is kind of a functional a pc                                 cash so it's an opcode cash for PHP and                                 then also a user cash for data that you                                 may pull out of MySQL that's completely                                 open source it's actually contributed to                                 Pekel as well so if you go and install                                 PHP on Windows you can go and pull down                                 this pekel extension and then                                 automatically get you know two hundred                                 percent plus improvement for PHP on                                 Windows managing PHP for some at least                                 in the Windows world can be a little                                 confusing so another project we created                                 with PHP manager which is just a plugin                                 for is and we decided we would just open                                 source that as well so that's also                                 available quite a few years ago we                                 created this thing called asp.net ajax                                 and what we realized is that it didn't                                 make a lot of sense for us to create our                                 own version of kind of javascript                                 library so we ended up just chucking                                 that thing                                 and then adopting jQuery and now we're                                 actually one of the largest contributors                                 to jQuery and we actually ship jQuery                                 with our tools in there the point I'm                                 trying to make there is that even within                                 our own net community there was kind of                                 a mind shift happening that was growing                                 out of just people that were working                                 strictly with kind of the Linux and the                                 PHP communities into our own web                                 developer communities in realizing that                                 it makes much more sense to contribute                                 to existing successful projects that it                                 is to try and compete with them even if                                 you do open source the code that's with                                 their or within them and so that kind of                                 mind shift kind of just started                                 trickling up and out within the company                                 and so after we started doing                                 contributions to jQuery the team that                                 basically does all our web platform                                 stuff for all the asp.net stuff said                                 well maybe we should take that same                                 approach with our own technologies and                                 so some of the other stuff they've been                                 doing now is they've now taken an                                 open-source pretty much the entire code                                 base for all the asp.net stuff so                                 asp.net MVC there's a web api and then                                 are we have a razor view engine which is                                 like an NBC view engine and then another                                 thing called the entity framework so                                 kind of the point that I'm making is                                 that you know the the whole                                 understanding and how to work with the                                 open source communities was now starting                                 to kind of grow outwards and touch a                                 larger section of the company right and                                 even into our own net engineering teams                                 there on the slide right and so that                                 kind of continues now actually in the                                 leadership that's been a part of that                                 part of the company is now largely                                 running a lot of our Azure and our cloud                                 stuff so some of the work we've been                                 doing now and includes not just Drupal                                 but other web communities like joomla                                 and then of course there's other open                                 source communities in the.net world like                                 umbraco and dotnetnuke and now you know                                 and then that's going even further now                                 with the work with java and nodejs and                                 then kind of finally the big kind of big                                 coup was                                 port for Linux itself within our own                                 cloud platform so now if you want to go                                 and you know host your applications in                                 in our windows azure cloud platform you                                 can choose windows if you want or you                                 can choose Linux or if you want you can                                 upload your own flavor of linux even so                                 it's actually now really to the point                                 where you know that mind shift is                                 actually kind of reflected in the                                 products and the services that we want                                 to come to market with right because we                                 really believe that the choice is what                                 matters right and the ability to make                                 that choice so I think now it's kind of                                 really come full circle for us as a                                 company so one of the you know as Mark                                 talked just said the where you're seeing                                 a lot of the change now is in our Azure                                 platform and where you're seeing where                                 you'll see that if you go to any one of                                 our one of our dev centers what we have                                 what we've realized in you know one of                                 the things that we've learned in being                                 committed to open source and                                 interoperability is that documentation                                 cannot take a backseat it can't be an                                 afterthought and if you take a look at                                 there's just a screenshot up there of                                 what's available on our dev center and                                 the various languages that we are we are                                 supporting and trying to provide                                 documentation for certainly presents its                                 challenges in trying to document all of                                 these other languages that other that                                 other groups and communities are                                 producing and document the                                 interoperability between those languages                                 and are in our platform one of the                                 things that we learned was that msdn                                 didn't work I know if any of you have                                 tried to use msdn documentation but that                                 was not something that was going to work                                 for us what we needed to do was get                                 documentation in front of where people                                 are reading documentation where you guys                                 go for it and put it in a format that                                 that you're used to and can and can                                 digest easily easily so we've you see a                                 lot more blogs that are focused on open                                 source technology you see a lot more you                                 see our documentation we've contributed                                 document                                 documentation to php.net and if you take                                 a look at the windows azure Dev Center                                 you'll see an entirely different format                                 different from from the msdn format as                                 well and I think the the crowning jewel                                 at least in my view about documentation                                 is that all the documentation is also                                 open source it's all in markdown on get                                 on github so when when you see that bug                                 in the documentation that says wait a                                 minute that code example doesn't work or                                 something isn't explained clearly you                                 can fork it and submit a pull request                                 and have that merged into the                                 documentation and it gets published on a                                 weekly basis so that's you know we're                                 we're taking not only the the mind shift                                 that has gone into the product and the                                 the services that we're offering you                                 know is also reflected in the                                 documentation and the processes for our                                 publishing documentation and as far as                                 the work that we've done to to increase                                 our openness with Drupal I've actually                                 been working specifically in the Drupal                                 community for the last two and a half                                 years and some of that work out actually                                 started well before I took on my role                                 and just to give you a sense for you                                 know the work we've done over across the                                 this timeline in                                                  partnered up with the Commerce guys and                                 sponsored the work that they were doing                                 around the sequel server integration and                                 then we extended that work to also                                 include sequel Azure and Azure itself so                                 we actually built and contributed                                 modules to drupal org that people could                                 use to enable sequel server integration                                 sequel as your integration and as your                                 deployment in terms of listening to                                 customers I started working with Jacob                                 writing and the drupal association was                                 really you know when I started out this                                 work I spent a lot of time listening to                                 feedback listening to what the needs of                                 the community were all about and some of                                 the things that came back pretty readily                                 what's hey you know we have some of                                 these windows developers and you know                                 they try to download the modules they're                                 all in tar file and some of them just                                 don't know what to do that because                                 they're not they're new to the platform                                 they don't understand what to do with                                 these tar files wouldn't it be great if                                 actually we had zip file formats                                 by the way we're doing a drupal.org you                                 know revision of the website and so we                                 talked about you know helping and                                 sponsoring updates to the site overall                                 which also included zip files format so                                 any time you actually upload a new                                 module that automatically gets converted                                 to zip and a year later I had heard                                 robert douglas actually say you know                                 it's something like forty four percent                                 of the downloads reaction that's a file                                 format so that got put to use pretty                                 quickly the other piece of feedback that                                 I got was in a dress shoe the de facto                                 Atul people were using and you know                                 people were really trying to cobble this                                 together on Windows you know someone                                 successfully would not not really and it                                 was a really painful process we invested                                 in sponsored sand work with pro people                                 which is now wonder crowd yeah for                                 people which is now under crowd but back                                 then they were pro people and they also                                 sponsors him work there to get dressed                                 compatible on Windows last last march in                                 denver moshe was doing a big drush                                 session which he's doing right now                                 actually in another room and one of the                                 things he said was it's arguably easier                                 to install drush on windows today than                                 on any other platform and that was due                                 to the investment and really the                                 partnering that we did with moshe and                                 greg anderson and folks in the community                                 of volunteered as well as pro people and                                 their work and making that compatible we                                 also invested on actually creating a set                                 of content to be delivered in person in                                 denver which was drupal at scale on                                 windows because we got a lot of                                 questions over and over again at the                                 booth about well you know we don't have                                 with the guidance around as how do we                                 deploy as a scale you know what it's the                                 equivalent of the things that i'm using                                 on my lamp stack to to windows server so                                 we enlisted the help of a microsoft MVP                                 who happened to also be a red hat linux                                 certified engineer and he was able to                                 talk and create training that was in                                 terms of what you guys know and                                 understand and so that was deliver in                                 denver and we actually have that online                                 for free on channel                                              actually consume that content now                                 the other thing that we did this past                                 year is we actually contributed directly                                 a couple modules when is the win cash                                 module to be integrated directly with                                 Drupal that's again performance                                 optimization mark referred to that a                                 little bit earlier and Oh data which is                                 unless a standard basically for data                                 exchange so both of these modules have                                 been contributed to drupal that or                                 directly by our teams we're also an                                 inaugural drupal supporting partner and                                 this is our seventh drupalcon and we've                                 got several more that we've already                                 enlisted subscribed for in this coming                                 year so you're going to continue to see                                 more and more of us and you know we are                                 really happy to be here and talking with

to make this                                 partnership more lively and on this list                                 you can see my daily work so on one hand                                 side I'm helping sponsoring different                                 events but what we have also started                                 really to do is if you are planning a                                 code spring or something like this you                                 can contact us because we have in all                                 the countries offices and we are more                                 than happy to give you these offices for                                 free use all the facilities on one hand                                 side this is taking away a lot of                                 organizational yeah overload to you                                 folks and you can really come together                                 as a community and use these facilities                                 for your code Sprint's or whatever                                 events you are planning then we have                                 also started roughly one-and-a-half year                                 ago to work with the CXO community of                                 Drupal                                 and twice a year the CX oz across Europe                                 they meet and they also use our                                 facilities and I participate in these                                 kind of events because Microsoft did                                 also grow as a company and we had also                                 our challenges so I can really help and                                 support the CXOs with different                                 questions like how can we do better                                 marketing for troopers or also really                                 some business and topics yeah and we are                                 also doing some projects together so for                                 example                                                              shops contacted me and he said hey I                                 have a big customer where sharepoint and                                 he would like to use through pile so I                                 was really helping this shop or this                                 project to come together and we have now                                 running Project in the Netherlands where                                 we have sharepoint and drupal integrated                                 together and this is also very positive                                 for the community because you don't have                                 very often the microsoft knowledge so we                                 can really bring together some                                 specialists and help you to gain the                                 knowledge but also on the other hand                                 side the customer is really happy if                                 there is also a bigger company behind                                 where they have already some licenses                                 installed another project is Microsoft                                 hell's I don't know have you ever heard                                 about Microsoft health it's a specific                                 solution for the hell's environment and                                 a Drupal shop who is now a microsoft                                 partner as well pinked me and he said                                 hey I have a big Hospital who would like                                 to use Drupal in the Microsoft health                                 solution together so now we have                                 integrated both products and this                                 hospital is publishing some information                                 of his health environment using                                 Microsoft Ellis and we are also working                                 a lot now with the government so as you                                 might know the government's are in front                                 of open data projects and also here the                                 how can we help each other to really                                 bring open data open government projects                                 together with Drupal and we have now                                 some projects in Ireland in Austria in                                 Germany where we really made this kind                                 of partnership life in projects so this                                 is a little bit what you can expect from                                 us from myself if you have

             is programs we're really trying to                                 identify high potential startups and we                                 saw a Commerce guys as being one of                                 these types of startups and so we really                                 want ensure by having someone connect                                 the dots for them within corporate was                                 where sexual kind of a big company being                                                                                                         sort of navigating our system so they                                 got help from a number of people                                 actually both corporate and worldwide in                                 our in our

a lot of the stuff comes together and a                                 customer success story sag awards so                                 that's a Screen Actors Guild they have                                 this huge hollywood awards ceremony that                                 happens in january now for most of the                                 year their traffic pattern is pretty                                 flat it's you know not a whole lot of                                 traffic that comes throughout the year                                 but leading up to that ceremony in                                 january starting in november you start                                 to see spikes in their traffic is not                                 very consistent literally seeing it as                                 the traffic spike up because of some                                 announcement and it's like up some more                                 and obviously in the days leading up to                                 the event itself they see a tremendous                                 surge of traffic that happens got a huge                                 amount of content huge amount of traffic                                 spikes and so in previous years what                                 they would do is they would throw a                                 bunch of hardware it is but even in                                 throwing all that hardware they would                                 still                                 I'm going to see system failures and and                                 go down and let this past year what they                                 did was they decided they were going to                                 place their bets on Azure and moved                                 their Drupal Drupal                                                    and I say that a lot of the stuff comes                                 together because in doing that they                                 actually use the azure and sequel as                                 your modules in the Commerce guys that                                 helped enable this particular scenario                                 and on top of that in the migration                                 process they actually used rush on                                 windows so you structure and wood has                                 automate a lot of the migration                                 including pulling out the content from                                 there are my silikal databases and                                 importing those into sequel azure and so                                 that automated a lot of what would                                 otherwise be a manual process and then                                 actually used rush which I thought was                                 wonderful so in that was a single night                                 that one premiere night what they saw                                 was basically over                                                     one night alone and                                                    as compared with the year before they                                 only saw about                                                      about                                                                number of page views tells me you know                                 people got to the site but they weren't                                 able to navigate around because of the                                 extreme traffic loads as you're in                                 Abel's you to be able to scale up and                                 scale down as you need those resources                                 and you know be able to manage the type                                 of low that you're experiencing at that                                 point in time so I hope that helps with                                 you know understanding some of what                                 comes together when we work together as                                 a community so I really see especially                                 this being a success story of not just                                 the work that we've done at Microsoft                                 that the stuff that we have done                                 together with you as a community and                                 with that I'm going to open up to                                 questions anyone have any questions or                                 yep                                 you                                 so the question was is the drupal                                 sharepoint integration we publish as                                 open source and Mikayla's answer was yes                                 on that it was developed between                                 Microsoft to Microsoft people and three                                 Drupal people and it's available as an                                 open source module it's published on                                 drupal.org any other questions we don't                                 bite                                 you may see that at some point they're                                 doing some integration I think with                                 codeplex on there now for projects just                                 I'd give that a little more time so                                 yeah I mean there's still TFS as the                                 primary source code and CI for visual                                 studio but its opening up right so that                                 visual studio actually sits in a                                 different part of the company and                                 they're they're starting to get some of                                 that religion as well so that's right                                 and then TFS is going to get get support                                 into it as well yep                                 the drupal's test boxes                                 hmm yeah it's that thing that sits over                                 in university of oregon i think the                                 heck's I think called                                 that's right I think we're hosting the                                 server's aren't we in oscc to do all                                 those Drupal core test compat the                                 compatibility testing yeah we started                                 working with Gabor back in the six days                                 to try and get that all set up so we got                                 I think we've got like all the tests                                 harnesses and everything that Drupal                                 uses to do its core builds for ya                                 no that's yeah I think we even that                                 started like over                                                        I don't know if net net craft has                                 numbers like that no but the Aqua team                                 has actually been sending me just logs                                 of the folks that are actually deploying                                 onto our platform City you guys probably                                 know they have a web crawler that you                                 know they send out and check you know                                 where Joe Blow is deployed and you know                                 they're definitely seeing that that                                 that's increasing I don't actually                                 remember the specific number or website                                 the last time they have sent me a report                                 but you know we're seeing that grow and                                 I you know my sense is that's definitely                                 growing with every drupalcon that we've                                 been to and it started with London we                                 were seeing streams of people coming in                                 and saying hey you know I used to try to                                 do the stuff manually on Windows and I                                 found web p I and that was so much                                 simpler and so it's pretty clear that as                                 people were you know stumbling on what                                 PIR hearing about it from us they were                                 starting to actually use it to point                                 windows because it wasn't as painful as                                 it used to be where they didn't realize                                 it that it worked at all and so you know                                 a lot of this is an education process                                 for us tell that to let people and it                                 works on our platform yeah and a lot of                                 the the other problem is getting an                                 accurate count because a lot of at least                                 anecdotally then the people I'm talking                                 to a large number of them we're doing                                 them behind firewalls so you can't                                 always it's even with the crow even with                                 Jesus crawler it's really impossible to                                 get an accurate count and then another                                 huge chunk of those are in pub sector so                                 a lot of education universities and                                 federal agencies are using Drupal                                 because then they work because they're                                 already using Windows                                 any other questions                                 I'm sorry Michaela I think that was used                                 that much and I know just sent me an                                 email and we figured out and you ready                                 much and hands-on work on the demand of                                 the community what's your twitter                                 release again Michaela I should bring                                 that back up so either you use mixcraft                                 as a Twitter abs or miki craft at                                 microsoft com                                 yeah any other questions                                 yeah actually I'm getting ready to play                                 a Drupal site actually running on a                                 couple of instances of a boon to on                                 Azure right now yeah yes I'm a user as                                 well yeah we do have other sites that                                 are actually deployed on Drupal we                                 actually acquired SI called teach dot                                 edu I think it's now teach dot org                                 that's also a Drupal site and so that's                                 part of our assets and that's something                                 that they're moving to Azure as well                                 yeah yeah see that's that's changing                                 right so like our contributions to                                 jQuery and we basically just checked out                                 our Ajax stuff right and is that that                                 Jake worries better and it's already                                 there and it's already being used by                                 pretty much everybody so this is let's                                 just contribute to that the other area                                 where we're leveraging existing stuff                                 that's already going on is in no DJ s                                 right so we have command line tools that                                 you can use to manage sites and VMS and                                 services in azure for windows we use                                 powershell right that's kind of our bash                                 right well for you know that doesn't                                 work very well on a macarons really                                 doesn't work on linux right so we built                                 command line tools for mac and linux                                 using nodejs because it's small it's                                 portable and it's easy so there again                                 we're trying to use you know existing                                 technologies open source technologies                                 and by the way contributing to them as                                 well because we want to make note run                                 great on windows too right so you can                                 actually use those same tools and run                                 those on windows if you want you don't                                 have to use power so but there again we                                 want to you know leverage something                                 that's being good oh and then have hats                                 right and then Hadoop is another thing                                 as well right where we basically chuck                                 dollar opposed that called power                                 something today whatever yeah we                                 basically were creating our Microsoft                                 version of Hadoop and then just realize                                 that you know just what why don't we                                 just work with the Hadoop guys right so                                 you can now actually go and sign up and                                 try a dupe on our on our Azure platform                                 right and you know use the little                                 JavaScript console and actually go and                                 work with some big data so so we have                                 just more and more examples right and                                 that's it's you know it started small                                 few years ago and now i think it's                                 largely kind of the way we want to do                                 stuff sure sweeping                                 right so not only with the documentation                                 but all our SDKs are now open source and                                 sitting out on github for Azure right so                                 our PHP SDK our node SDK or Java SDK                                 actually the.net one isn't yet but it                                 will be they just got to clean it up a                                 little we've actually been at the                                 company long enough to actually                                 personally witness a lot of these                                 changes ourselves I've been with the                                 company eight years mark you've been                                    years right and I was an open source you                                 know developer before then right so I                                 use PHP back in the very early scary                                 days and actually so back in the four                                 days before I joined Microsoft and then                                 first you know dotnet came out and I                                 started doing that stuff as well but                                 it's been interesting watching the                                 evolution for that company though yeah                                 question                                 yeah I mean it was a business right                                 there was an argument that was a                                 statement made by a business guy right a                                 c-level executive not by an engineer                                 right I don't think the engineers yeah                                 so what's happened is that people at the                                 company that understood it finally got                                 the message through and up into the into                                 the leadership ranks in that company                                 right so it was a small group of people                                 at first right there's a guy named Sam                                 ramji who no longer with the company                                 right but he spearheaded a lot of that                                 mind shift at the company very early on                                 a long time ago and then others you know                                 they joined the company and I think at                                 some point you just hit a tipping point                                 right where it's like look at the stuff                                 she's not going to bite right so in fact                                 working with it makes much more sense                                 right                                 No                                 you know who knows it's never off the                                 table right and there's two things                                 that's going on right i mean certainly                                 creating interoperability and open                                 sourcing the client pits and make that                                 happen or one thing but actually we're                                 contributing to open to these projects                                 as well right so that's another it's                                 another very big shift that's kind of                                 happened over the last you know eight to                                 ten years here so I think your                                 skepticism is definitely fair right and                                 and and how far does it how far is it                                 going to go and you know is it is it                                 going to go how far up the chain is it                                 can go and i think that's that's                                 completely fair but time is going to                                 tell and what I've seen in the last I                                 have only been here for five at                                 Microsoft for five years and the the                                 excitement that you see among developers                                 who are actually I mean they're                                 developers at Microsoft they get to now                                 play with they can kind of come out of                                 the closet so to speak right and and                                 play with all the openly play with all                                 the open source stuff that they're                                 playing with anyway but not you know                                 there's that there's this this kind of                                 new excitement among the developer ranks                                 and and that's just kind of bubbling up                                 and I'm you know I I feel good about the                                 direction that things are going and feel                                 pretty good that it is going to it is                                 going to continue to bubble up to the                                 top but you know I understand and                                 respect your skepticism                                 I don't know what I don't know what that                                 means other than just being an                                 interesting alliteration I don't know                                 what do you mean yeah well you know you                                 know standards bodies work right okay so                                 no that's never going to happen right                                 because it's impossible to do that with                                 a standards body right I mean                                 yep                                 look at within standards bodies there's                                 a history of every company trying to do                                 something like that right so we're we're                                 not alone in that it's just you know                                 it's just the way that process works                                 right I mean without an open source                                 community itself I mean you know if we                                 tried to commit something that was just                                 uniquely Microsoft and rhys would say go                                 go to hell right he's not going to                                 commit it so I mean within the open                                 source communities themselves or those                                 projects there's a there's a standard                                 for right and a process for how you get                                 stuff committed into it right so it                                 would so to your point are we going to                                 try to extend it or whatever you say                                 I I have faith in that then that the                                 open source process works right and that                                 I don't see ever that being a problem                                 right and then with standards bodies                                 that's you know it's kind of a long                                 really ugly conversation that's just the                                 way that the whole process works right                                 so                                 Oh                                 it's kind of a bit skewed because the                                 largest                                 cuz                                 so just to comment on your you know us                                 dogfooding some of the things that we're                                 contributing to open source projects                                 that sag awards example that I gave to                                 largely that work was done by our                                 internal consulting team so they they                                 were using it they're using for you know                                 an external customer but they were                                 definitely pounding on the sequel as or                                 you know I'm using brush themselves                                 directly and so as part of that you know                                 obviously they found you know certain                                 issues that we you know we're you know                                 part of the process to help ensure got                                 fixed through the community the people                                  that we sponsored and that we were doing                                  things the right way making sure those                                  went back into the project yeah by the                                  way we dog food every day the hyper-v                                  support we contributed to linux to                                  actually host it in azure itself right                                  so we're actually that's actually going                                  into a service offering in itself so                                  this is a very small example but for                                  writing for writing a lot of our                                  documentation now since we're doing it                                  in markdown pad weep and were you doing                                  it in markdown we use markdown pad and                                  we started using that and found a ton of                                  problems we had engineers then                                  contribute the changes to that projects                                  to make it work better and I think                                  that's the kind of thing that you're                                  that you're talking about is being using                                  those those projects and then actually                                  contributing to make them better really                                  small example in you know markdown pad                                  but I don't I think what you're talking                                  about is you know entirely possible on a                                  bigger scale um and just a side note                                  drupal.org we contributed some                                  documentation that site and I was                                  personally the one that was funneling                                  some that content to drupal org took me                                  a while to figure out all that all                                  worked and I as part of that I figured                                  out that there were some issues too so I                                  actually posted those issues back to                                  drupal.org just so that you guys knew                                  what I ran into is I was a end-user drew                                  blood org any other questions                                  by the way in case you didn't see this                                  this is Mark's laptop it is in fact a                                  mac and you know everyone goes aren't                                  you going to get in trouble and that's                                  not the case actually that's the best                                  it's actually the best Windows laptop                                  I've ever had in my life it's actually                                  running I'm actually running back yeah                                  they should be an oem for Windows don't                                  you think                                  uh I don't think we'll ever do a                                  Microsoft Linux I don't know if I we                                  would have the final say on that but                                  there's others that have been do it                                  better let's say right why would we why                                  bother right and that actually i think                                  the some would probably look like an                                  extender and embrace and extend another                                  thing right so let's just say that's                                  probably best left to the experts right                                  so yeah we're pretty tight with you know                                  shuttleworth is pretty happy with us                                  right now i don't want to piss them off                                  well and don't forget we now have linux                                  on windows azure right and that's                                  actually that the way we did that is                                  those guys are the guys that are                                  actually offering it on there right so                                  it's actually you know they're distros                                  they maintain it they provide service                                  for it right so that's really the right                                  way to do it they're the experts not us                                  so                                  yeah that's why we I think we're doing                                  it right this time yeah all right well                                  thank you everyone for coming to our                                  session appreciate it it was oh I just                                  looked at it and assume that was you
