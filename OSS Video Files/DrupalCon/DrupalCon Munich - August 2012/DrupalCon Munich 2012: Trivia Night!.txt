Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Trivia Night!
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Do you think you know EVERYTHING about Drupal?

Well now is your chance to prove it! Pick 3 buddies and bring the team to Drupal's own Trivia Night.

In the grand tradition of pub quizzes, there will be 6 rounds of 10 questions covering everything about Drupal, and a few more about general web topics. Your team will compete with the best of Drupal brains to capture the title of Drupal trivia champions. We'll have a few small prizes to keep things interesting.

Of course, you'll have to know it all in your head - strictly no use of mobile devices or laptops, etc. allowed!

The first Drupal quiz was held in Chicago to wild acclaim, and has since then become a DrupalCon tradition. Exact time and location will be announced.

The Drupalcon quiz is presented by Drupal Ireland.
