already on                               our on our thing on on the website so                               hook us up if you liked it so I'm Frank                               febrero I'm the CTO of face to                               technology the moderator of the panel                               but I won't be talking about any                               particular solution one of the things                                that I'm very interested in is how all                                of these problems how all of these                                solutions fit the problems that my                                company has every day and you know even                                though some of the folks talking or from                                my company that's not to say that that's                                always the best solution so I'm really                                interested in seeing what else is out                                there hi my name is Neil Hastings I'm                                the software architect for a pastry                                technology I'm going to talk about the                                single page node approach basically this                                is as much core as possible so or my                                mantra is more use more core and use                                less contrition is liberalizing several                                contributor modules also but using                                record with a couple trips the beam                                module which is a way to do block                                entities a block references module and a                                template field module their primary                                modules that i'll be using showing today                                all right so my name is Christophe I'm                                also known as rental on Drupal a dork                                and on twitter i am the elite maintainer                                of display sweet and also a container of                                the filter module so there's a lot of                                reasons that why we have written display                                sweet i will talk a little bit of the of                                that when i'm going to give the demo                                because it's obvious when i'm going to                                give the demo why I've written this so                                i'm chris johnson i'm a director of                                engineering at phase                                                  speaking about context and how we use it                                for layouts even though the origins of                                context weren't really to solve a layout                                problem primarily just the context                                module which comes bundled with three                                other modules that will go through and                                then i'll give some pointers as well to                                other modules that are a little more                                layout friendly hi my name is Matt                                Cheney I'm a drupal developer and Drupal                                distribution specialists at Pantheon                                based in San Francisco California for a                                long time I've been really into working                                on the panels module and then more                                recently the panel's IP and panel Iser                                module and I'm going to try to convince                                you today why those tools are really                                awesome and recently I've sort of tried                                to bundle all of those together into a                                standalone distribution called panoply                                that sort of takes the best of the                                panel's worlds and puts it together so                                that you can download it head and have                                like a pretty awesome solution in one                                place and that's what I'll be doubling                                today well that's way over there hi I'm                                Chris Vander water I'm actually the                                Drupal                                                           initiative owner and oh thank you and                                yeah I'm here mostly just to kind of                                answer questions that you might have                                about core in relation to these things                                largely my objective is to kill all of                                these modules                                alright yeah we're gonna roll into the                                demos now each person will get about                                five minutes and I'll try and stick to                                that time five minutes to talk about how                                wonderful this is so live demos nothing                                will ever go wrong I promise so I'm                                going to pass demonstrations I've talked                                about the bean module so today I'm going                                to focus a little more on template field                                and how it controls your layout tip feel                                montiel came out of a project we're                                working on where everything needed to be                                revisional and translatable in the UI so                                everything really much had to be around                                nodes that's the only thing in Drupal                                  that was revisional out of the box so                                the template field module basically                                turns templates in to see tools X                                portables to allow you to export them                                you can have my code and files so                                examples have here some examples that I                                have pre-built so are too commonly a                                three-column layout you can have a                                 carousel sort of stuff the actual page                                 itself we actually use a mustache                                 template template rendering engine that                                 rendering engine is swappable but we're                                 using mustache because that's what the                                 editorial people seem to like a lot                                 better than using the triple way so that                                 allows them to inter you I to build and                                 version layouts using mustache and a lot                                 of jas CSS and any triple core libraries                                 to that page and they were also ability                                 to build out the input definition that                                 the editorial team were actually used to                                 fill in this information so this puts a                                 lot of a lot of control in the UI as far                                 as exactly how you want things to                                 display so this is just a quick                                 demonstration the modules temple under                                 field which I could have you want to                                 think more version up of                                                 never never have the lockdown of the API                                 okay so this is basically it looks like                                 the constant editor this is a queer                                 using template field here and down here                                 we're using something called formatter                                 field for merit of field module                                 integrates the tempo field module allows                                 you to use templates as a formatter so                                 this actually control is a formatter of                                 a field so you can have to do that on a                                 no reddit form instead of in the                                 the field you I so this gives a lot of                                 control over how things are displayed so                                 really use case is with the editorial                                 Stephanie's extremely highly customized                                 pages but you don't want to do a whole                                 bunch of one-off TPL files or different                                 layouts discussions and you don't want                                 to use panels because fans module is so                                 for example you know yeah the choosers                                 you have the selection to choose                                 different layouts a lot of                                 configurations here so you have some                                 basic ones you can get more complex to                                 do layouts that have images background                                 images I'm going to try this and                                 hopefully this works well I won't use                                 your images oops                                 oh I don't want that picture no no no no                                 no no no i'm going to show you what it                                 is this is my that's for a different                                 demonstration later okay so we have the                                 ability to really really highly                                 customized templates and so this is the                                 screen this is example of the screen and                                 a Content administrator would use and                                 not something who's a site administrator                                 the site administrator the ones that do                                 the templates and so this thing that was                                 total of options these are all                                 built I'll and I input definitions that                                 I did before we can also stop here five                                 I don't know what half this stuff does I                                 didn't build this one but white all                                 right good enough and you can add                                 multiple items here one of the really                                 cool things about template field is if I                                 want to add another one just a basic                                 this is just a basic content you have                                 the full WYSIWYG so you can do things                                 like embedding content betting nodes or                                 anything you do in a wisdom you can do                                 in here and that's really what in the                                 project we use this on we're really                                 taking advantage of everything into busy                                 but we can that's a really huge piece                                 this for matter which allows you to do                                 is we have a a                                                       carousel that it's set to you they can                                 be used with the formatter so what this                                 does is it takes each of the items in                                 the different layers here and adds them                                 as a slide on a carousel I want to try                                 that and see how awesome it works so                                 we're just gonna use the defaults no                                 this didn't work before solo see how                                 works Oh page title on this the page                                 title and the last thing on the note                                 page i'm going to show you this is the                                 block reference module so basically this                                 is this kind of thing this came out of                                 that energy gutter project we use this                                 really heavily with the bean module so                                 us depart of energy to be able to place                                 blocks in the console in different spots                                 and there's a lot of presentations on                                 that already I don't want to spend time                                 on that today so this is awesome slide                                 and I'm guessing it's not going to work                                 it's not going to work but it works on                                 our project I promise I'm almost out of                                 time that went really fast thanks of a                                 good day                                 so display sweet so there's a lot of                                 reasons why we have written this place                                 wait there's I'm not going to name them                                 all because it's impossible to do that                                 one of the things is that consists of                                 markup for all your notes or users or                                 whatever entity that you have in your                                 Drupal                                                                   number one because if you in the past                                 what we did is like okay here's a note                                 EPL let's change it a little bit but                                 then you have a listing of Savior                                 articles then you probably do that with                                 use right and then you get different                                 markup so it's easy to change that but                                 by default the markup is inconsistent                                 with all other solutions in kind of away                                 and we are trying to solve that which is                                 weird I guess but um to go to the demo                                 so for instance if you go to structure                                 content types you get you get two things                                 managed fields and manage display so                                 manage feels is where you're going to                                 add new fields on two entities and then                                 you also have managed display which by                                 default does not do a lot it only lists                                 all the fields that come from fields API                                 that's basically the only thing that you                                 can do people for instance miss the                                 title field they can drag the title                                 field around here that's impossible and                                 it's by default hard-coded in dino TPL                                 that's basically where we were like yeah                                 this doesn't work at all we want to try                                 and make sure that field you I becomes a                                 little bit most more smarter in that                                 sense we're going to add more fields                                 more properties that are on the notes                                 for instance a title a reporter a                                 there's a lot of other things and also                                 the ability to just inject any kind of                                 property that you can think of you can                                 create new fields in code they come up                                 to feel you I and then you can do                                 whatever you like so also it's to be                                 like half a central place or your entity                                 things so the way that we were basically                                 is we use page manager to work on the                                 page level and the display of your                                 individual entities is done for us at                                 least infield you lie so basically                                 that's difference between how well are                                 the solution                                 work I guess so field display street at                                 this point it's not enabled yet so this                                 is filter why how it looks like I'm                                 going to go to modules and then display                                 sweet comes with four modules so this                                 place with this is you have missed see                                 tools but i'll get on so there's there's                                 four modules you have to enable the                                 display sweet core module which will do                                 a lot and what it does for you is um                                 come on internet every stop using the                                 internet oh yeah but i'll go on so I                                 cook the core module what it does is                                 going to enable you to select layouts                                 for your entities and also yeah so                                 you'll be able to select a new layout so                                 there we ship with a couple of                                 predefined layouts a one column to                                 column and etc etc and also will expose                                 those properties like title order onto                                 field you I the three other modules                                 there's display sweet extras they                                 contain a lot of nice goodies um but                                 they're not in the main module why you                                 don't really like need to use them all                                 the time in different projects but we do                                 I mean it depends on the project and the                                 solutions that you want you have so I'm                                 not going to talk about the display                                 sweet axis because there's too many in                                 them but you can individually enable or                                 disable things in there there's also the                                 display sweet search module who likes                                 theming search results who think it's                                 easy nobody okay but it's kind of a pain                                 and pain to like trying to you to you do                                 CSS on search results are displaced                                 research will take over apache solr                                 search pages also note started the core                                 as well and you will get pretty search                                 results you can put an image on the left                                 and you've already on the right and well                                 you can go nuts basically so let's                                 enable                                 yes it's good all right okay I have to                                 go back to field your eye sorry so I                                 actually have to go to structure so                                 there's a new entry here called display                                 sweet if you go over oh this is this                                 place we first version asked for the                                 second ranch man no problem no problem                                 no problem no problem at all but it's                                 babe there's there's actually two                                 branches right now with display sweet                                 we're actually also having a sprint                                 after this session to try and get a new                                 release for the first branch and                                 possibly a release candidate for the                                 second range but basically they do the                                 same thing but it's more user experience                                 things that have been fixed in the                                 second branch but the important thing is                                 here you go to layout you get an                                 overview of all your entities that are                                 you in a Drupal website so you see                                 comment article text enormity term user                                 basically note is more important we                                 switch that in the second branch because                                 you've have if you have a lot of content                                 types your screen is going to be filled                                 with common things first which is stupid                                 we switch that for instance but                                 basically click on manage the display                                 then you go back to filter why and                                 nothing happens this is the number one                                 issue that I get in the issue queue I                                 enable this little sweet and nothing                                 happens and like okay what you need to                                 do is go to a vertical tab here and                                 actually select the layout so we ship it                                 a couple of layouts you can either                                 create new layouts in your module or in                                 your theme so you can basically choose                                 whatever you want to do and so let's go                                 select two columns stacked and what you                                 basically now get is what you see is a                                 header the left right to footer and oh                                 the field API fields are here and then                                 you see the all the other properties                                 like the read more user picture links                                 title comments and tags no taxes feel                                 gameplay phillippe I feel sorry but you                                 can add more and now basically what you                                 now have to do is just let's move fields                                 somewhere right for instance this is a                                 title I can put in on the right display                                 sweet gives you the ability to add new                                 properties and also to                                 hear them so this is the field the title                                 field do I want to have a link back to                                 the entity say yes which rapper do you                                 want and this is also extendable in its                                 extendable yes so that's basically what                                 display sweet does from its score and                                 I've been doing this now for three years                                 and in the beginning I had not so a                                 clear vision on what it really did this                                 is what it does it's an extension on                                 field wife for Drupal core                                               the ability you have to have simple                                 layouts and more properties on entities                                 so that's it for my demo                                 so I'm going to talk a little bit about                                 the the history of context and then jump                                 into the demo so context first started                                 in                                                                    had a little bit of work in Drupal five                                 but then by the fall of that year it was                                 actually moved into a to the Drupal                                      terms of the version that was working on                                 and I always like to describe context as                                 a graphical you don't a graphical                                 interface for Drupal hooks um what it                                 does and what it was designed to do was                                 take a lot of the boilerplate stuff that                                 you would used to do by hard coding some                                 PHP code and a hook and standardize the                                 action that had to happen and extract                                 the configuration part so for example if                                 you wanted to do something where you                                 would say that when a node is termed is                                 tagged with term X I want you to put                                 this block in the right rail it would                                 take care of the being able to say what                                 X is and what y is and you would never                                 have to code all of the code to actually                                 do the placement again um so sort of as                                 a side effect of that it formalized a                                 quote unquote the best way to do each of                                 these particular little task right                                 because context underneath it score for                                 each plug-in the plug-in says in context                                 to execute this particular plug-in at                                 this particular hook point and that's                                 that's how it actually operates so once                                 once you were able to extract that                                 configuration then we lay our UI on top                                 of it and basically get all of that out                                 of developers hands and into site                                 configurators and site administrators                                 hands um it wasn't designed strictly as                                 a layout tool it just as a side effect                                 can get used for that and I like to talk                                 about it is home it actually has two                                 functions there's placement of                                 particular items that it does really                                 well I think and then there's other                                 reactions that you can use for for                                 actual layout right so layout might be                                 two column or three column or four                                 column but then there's placement of                                 items of what do you want to go into                                 each column under which particular                                 conditions and those are sort of                                 two separate things in the context world                                 so when you enable it there it comes                                 with three modules and they're already                                 enabled here but I'll run through them                                 very quickly the context module itself                                 is just named context and it's the                                 engine it's what allows you to have                                 plugins and that type of thing so that's                                 this one you're going to have to enable                                 that one to get either about either the                                 other two modules contacts you are much                                 like views has a has an engine and a                                 views you I if you don't want your                                 administrators to actually be able to                                 change things in your contacts if it's                                 more of a mechanism for capturing                                 configuration and moving it between                                 sites and that type of thing you don't                                 need that enabled and then context                                 layouts is one of the the layout systems                                 that you would get out of the box with                                 it so once you have contacts you by                                 there's actually two places that your                                 that you'll typically use this and what                                 I'm going to show you is the dev branch                                 of                                                                    committed a lot of work to some of the                                 UI there so this is your basic context                                 administrative UI you can come in and                                 add new context each context is composed                                 of a condition or set of conditions and                                 reactions and so out of the box you have                                 set of conditions where you can say this                                 one should be active if another context                                 is active it should be active if this I                                 mean this particular menu item if you                                 know I own this particular node type                                 right there's all kinds of reactions                                 that you can have I mean conditions that                                 you can have here and then once those                                 conditions are true and you can say they                                 can be true independently or they must                                 all be true you can say well what do you                                 want to have happen and the reactions so                                 the one that's placement is the block                                 reaction and this is the one that that I                                 found we must frequently use and this is                                 the one that you'll most frequently not                                 use from this screen if you want it to                                 be very user friendly for your users but                                 you can say okay I want this set of                                 blocks and I want to go in this                                 particular region the layout one is also                                 present from the box so if you don't                                 have contacts layouts enabled you will                                 not get                                 I'm looking for it there's a there's an                                 option here for the theme oh and this                                 thing doesn't support the layouts that's                                 what it is there's an option to say i                                 want this particular layout and that's                                 based on whether or not your theme                                 supports it i mean if i have time off                                 we'll go through that the interface that                                 most people you'll want to use for                                 placement is you'll come in you'll                                 choose configure layout from any block                                 you'll be able to choose from the                                 layouts that are active well hide that                                 it'll highlight all of the region's you                                 can say what you want to put there and                                 so I'm going to say I want to put my                                 puppies so to put the block there you                                 could say you're done and that you want                                 to save your changes and now you've just                                 manipulated that layout over that of the                                 placement there and once you have lots                                 of different layouts you can drag things                                 across regions and delete the blogs and                                 that type of thing but that's that's the                                 basics of what you get                                 alright alright so I'm anchoring this                                 four-person relay so hopefully do a                                 better a little bit better than the                                 American team sorry so I'm showing off                                 today a distribution of Drupal called                                 panoply and it's as I mentioned earlier                                 it bundles panels panels i peep analyzer                                 and a number of other sort of custom                                 pieces together and this is an install                                 of panoply right out of the box I turned                                 on the demo content modules so there's                                 some content there but the goal here is                                 to like try to take out some of the                                 Drupal administration into site building                                 and creating pages because if i have a                                 drupal site like one of the things that                                 i want to do is add a page and control                                 its layout so to do that with monopoly                                 you get two options to actually start to                                 create pages you get a Content page                                 which is just a normal page node that's                                 panelized using the panel Iser module                                 and it gives you some extra options and                                 you have the ability to create landing                                 pages which are using that it's using                                 page manager just to create a general                                 page so I'll go ahead and add a landing                                 page and i'll just say landing page and                                 landing can be my thing it'll add it to                                 the menu and all that's all i need to                                 get going and now i actually have a page                                 on my site that's in the main navigation                                 which is very cool haven't gone to the                                 drupal back end yet don't think i will                                 the cool piece then is that at the                                 bottom of this page and by the way every                                 page there's a customize this page and                                 change layout on this page if i get                                 customized i got to bring up what i                                 believe is the crown jewel of drupal                                 which is the panel's ipe and it goes you                                 add like information panel pains                                 actually to to a region on the page so i                                 go ahead and i'll go ahead and just add                                 a number of things here these are using                                 the feel double panel pains module that                                 creates the entities it's very similar                                 to the bean module but i'll go ahead and                                 add a quick content list will um will                                 have it be content type my content page                                 alpha three things and i'll show the                                 teasers let's say i'll go ahead and save                                 that and now well BAM surprise i have a                                 landing page that has a bunch of content                                 on it that's very cool now here's the                                 really cool part controlling your layout                                 so                                 I want to change the layout of this page                                 what do i do i click this button that                                 says change layout and it brings up I                                 think we may be are now up to                                    different layouts that are all like pre                                 packaged with panoply they're all risk                                 they're all cross-browser they're all                                 responsive and they have little pictures                                 you can see what they are so I've got                                 this one which is just a single column                                 but i'll go ahead and add a sidebar to                                 the page and now i have a page that has                                 a sidebar which is great so now let's go                                 ahead and add an image to that because i                                 might want an image so i've got this                                 little widget here that says add image                                 I've got this demo image that I have but                                 I go ahead and remove that and go ahead                                 and upload one and downloads maybe i'll                                 go ahead and add a picture of mr. Jay                                 Batson who would approve of this demo                                 he's very into making pages and um oops                                 sorry there's this sort of as live                                 update tool it's pretty cool with it                                 still try that one again so these it                                 what it basically is doing is creating                                 like a feel double panel pain like on                                 the fly which is sort of neat so it'll                                 like auto update the image was call it J                                 know and it's cool because I can                                 actually upload it and I can sort of see                                 it I can make it reusable if i want i                                 can add it a link i can add a caption if                                 i want which i don't and i can go ahead                                 and save it and now if i save I've got a                                 picture on the site which is very cool                                 let's go add some more stuff I'll                                 customize this I'll go ahead i'll add a                                 list of links people build a lot of                                 Drupal sites you probably have like a                                 quick links box that you you do so we                                 can add a link to Drupal even though I                                 checked on my phone it actually is down                                 which is sort of weird drupalcon let's                                 call this drupalcon and we'll call these                                 links and i can go ahead and add those                                 and now i have a list of links and so                                 i'm starting to make a page like this is                                 a kind of thing if you're like building                                 a comp or doing drupal you'd be really                                 interested in so that's cool let's go                                 ahead and cost let's change the layout                                 again so instead of two column let's go                                 ahead and add three column I got a three                                 column right there go ahead and save                                 okay three column and now I can start to                                 play around and maybe what I want to do                                 is I'll take this this list of content                                 over here I'll put it in                                 I bar and it sort of condenses down so                                 that's some cool responsive images I go                                 ahead and configure and I got a bunch of                                 options because this is actually a view                                 and there's really cool views and panels                                 integration because Rho miles works on                                 both and makes them talk together so                                 panoply sort of leverage a lot of this                                 so instead of having a list of content                                 well maybe just do fields and maybe I                                 won't maybe I'll only have two of them                                 let's say and I can sort of see okay                                 it's safe and now I have that then the                                 middle I can decide maybe I'll make a                                 map this is the default the pantheon HQ                                 I'll go ahead and make them out and now                                 I have a cool map on the page which is                                 sort of nice um there's San Francisco                                 that's pretty hilly later but it looks                                 flat okay i'll go ahead and customize                                 maybe I don't want the map but I do want                                 to put the picture of Jay right there so                                 it's sort of like bounces up which is                                 sort of cool maybe I don't I'll put it                                 down there I'll go ahead and add some                                 more content at a list of content here                                 maybe I want to store this as a table                                 which is sort of neat maybe make the                                 titles don't really want the image and                                 I'll go save now have a list table data                                 which is neat go here maybe I'll add                                 some text it's too much text this is                                 using a veggie lipson by the way if                                 you're vegetarian and you want you want                                 demo content it's a cool one so I'll go                                 ahead and do that and then maybe I'll go                                 ahead and make a carousel those are sort                                 of fun so I'll go ahead and remove this                                 and have a picture of greece's bicycle                                 which is sort of nice and let's see if                                 it's a little bit bigger screen you can                                 see them both at the same time but                                 you'll see the the end result which is                                 sort of fun bike and I will go ahead and                                 hit save there and hit save and now I've                                 got like a page that sort of customized                                 and configured relatively quickly which                                 is neat the last little bit as i can                                 actually go ahead and you even can                                 stylize these things so I added all the                                 drupal style so we can make that thing                                 blew and now we've got a sort of page                                 and you know it looks the way it looks                                 it's using the bartech theme so it has                                 those kinds of                                 miles but panoply will work in any theme                                 because all it's doing saying this                                 panels does is it just takes over the                                 content variable and then everything                                 else is sort of as your theme is so if                                 you have an existing site you can put                                 this on or every starting a new site you                                 can put it on but the cool bit is that                                 this like change layout is true on this                                 page it's true on the homepage that                                 comes with panoply so I could change                                 change the layout here it's also true on                                 every single node page these are node                                 pages there's a default that node pages                                 have but you can override them per node                                 which is very neat and I think this is a                                 really neat solution because it like                                 gives you a central tool to like create                                 really powerful landing pages and like                                 not once did I go into the Drupal                                 backend to do it so it's the kind of                                 thing as a cycle there's really fast but                                 it's also the kind of thing for a drupal                                 product or if you turned it over to                                 someone that you could have and you can                                 make a lot of really neat things thank                                 I'm not showing anything i'm just gonna                                 be here oh alright so there won't be a                                 demo of any d                                                           in development but cool so we're going                                 to I guess transition into I guess a Q&A                                 period so there's microphones if anybody                                 has questions stand up but in the                                 meantime as people are getting to that I                                 wanted to ask each of the people on the                                 panel question what are some sites out                                 there that we might know of that are                                 using your solutions and so energy gov                                 which is the US Department is website is                                 what founded like to be module initially                                 and Robin Hood is a foundation in New                                 York City they actually use their using                                 template field and actually displaying                                 SVG files for dynamic Rafael Jas driven                                 by content which is a really really cool                                 use case there are several more but I                                 don't know sure um I think if every oh                                 I'm sorry um the first version of this                                 place we that's actually still is still                                 running from like three years ago is on                                 a website called studio Brussels it's a                                 radio station in Belgium so any if                                 you're from Belgium so your Brussels                                 actually runs the first version of this                                 place wheat and it then was basically or                                 test case because studio Brussels has I                                 think like                                                            like that so it's a really complex site                                 regarding content and at some point we                                 were just like doing old-style theming                                 and we had a lot of template files and                                 that got really really messy when we had                                 to do updates during development it was                                 just crazy so I think you are a lista                                 tube                                 ve have a look it's the oldest version                                 of this place we'd actually running so                                 great um I would say pretty much any                                 site that the phase                                               probably using context in some form or                                 another oh that's a lot of the sites                                 that face to develop these uses context                                 in some form or another not always not                                 always for layout Oh probably the                                 easiest way to see it is to just                                 download open public and take a look at                                 it oh it uses context pretty heavily in                                 all but with like one particular little                                 area where it uses some panels so that's                                 probably the best way if you wanted to                                 play with the approach that context                                 takes to placement of stuff to greet it                                 panels and analyzer are obviously very                                 popular modules have a hundred thousands                                 of installs across a lot of sites                                 probably a lot of people in this room                                 panoply is relatively new it's just in                                 beta                                                                   the things that it's really good for                                 aside from just building general sites                                 is it's a good sort of base distribution                                 for for other distributions so there's a                                 higher education distribution called                                 open academy that has a lot of like sort                                 of higher education university style                                 features it's based on panoply and the                                 university of california berkeley uses                                 that for a lot of their sites as sort of                                 a solution to let individuals sort of                                 you know customize our site's as has                                 hired workers if you're interested in                                 trying panoply of course you can                                 download it from drupal org or on                                 pantheon we let people spin up free free                                 sites to play around with the approach                                 and you can play off the demo content                                 and do the kind of demo I showed today                                 so um just to see in the audience how                                 many people are using panels or have                                 used them before                                 so what about context for a block layout                                 display sweet template field beam suite                                 right off you guys all eat very cool so                                 can you talk a little bit about Drupal                                   and kind of how you how you plan to kill                                 all of these if possible so to some                                 degree here we're obviously running up                                 against like time issues which is always                                 the case when you're working inside of                                 core development but you know the real                                 objective is to kind of take basically                                 what Matt demoed and get as close as we                                 can to that within Drupal core it's a                                 very powerful solution it gives us the                                 ability to essentially change layouts on                                 every single page throughout the system                                 as we have need and that's really                                 important from like supporting install                                 profiles and really giving people what                                 they want sort of a perspective as to                                 how I intend on doing that at the moment                                 we've done a lot of foundational work                                 and I'll give a huge update on that in                                 my in my core conversation today but you                                 know we're really what we're doing is                                 we're replicating a lot of the base                                 foundational components that make up                                 panels so a lot of CTools components are                                 actually migrating into core things like                                 plugins and stuff like that that                                 everybody was already using pretty                                 heavily so it made sense for core to                                 support it and then you know as you'll                                 see kind of in the demo that I've got                                 today there are a lot of specifically                                 modules that phase two is currently                                 developing that even if we didn't go any                                 further than the patch I'm going to show                                 up today we could kill off like three of                                 the modules that they're having to                                 maintain currently because core would be                                 capable of doing most of that stuff                                 which I hope we all agree is actually a                                 good thing so I think they agree with me                                 so I don't really care so yeah I mean we                                 we really aren't at the like even the                                 panels                                 love doing things much less like a                                 panels everywhere panel Iser solution                                 but we're working really hard to get                                 there as quickly as we can and obviously                                 we need more helping hands so if you're                                 interested in that which I sort of                                 assumed that you might be if you're in                                 the layout session you know you should                                 talk to me and we're going to start                                 really trying to organize what needs to                                 be done there so well thanks so one of                                 the problems that a lot of our clients                                 have is that they want to be able to see                                 what their layout changes are going to                                 look like before either before their                                 their site users see it or they want to                                 be able to stage these changes and allow                                 it to be previewed by other people in                                 the organization before it actually goes                                 live so a lot of ways that's handled                                 this through views of revisions do any                                 or all of these solutions support                                 revisions yeah a panel Iser will do                                 revisions panels itself won't do                                 revisions although there's an entity                                 revision scheduler module that will help                                 to do some of the sort of like sub                                 revision support but that like a lot of                                 the way that panoply sort of helps to                                 accomplish this is by letting use for                                 the drag and make changes on your site                                 but everything I was showing if you                                 there's like a save button at the bottom                                 if you decided to hit cancel for example                                 it would just revert to the way it was                                 and that's sort of a way since you got                                 to see it with the CSS and see how it                                 looks that you can just revert out if                                 you if you don't like it yeah when one                                 more point on that is that panels in                                 general kind of supports the ability to                                 build variants of pages so like you                                 could probably if you needed to have                                 some sort of mechanism where you                                 actually build it for a specific variant                                 for people so that they can look at it                                 once they approve it you could you know                                 cloned that out to the main one or                                 something like that I don't know how                                 that would work with analyzer because I                                 haven't messed with panel Iser much but                                 at least for like kind of a traditional                                 panels approach that will work as well                                 for context that that's really kind of                                 dependent on how you how you structure                                 the activations of your context so if                                 you if you use context that are set up                                 to activate on the particular value of a                                 field if you're using like context node                                 or context entity field or one of the                                 other modules that they offer those                                 types of conditions then yes it would it                                 would support revisions in that                                 mechanism because that value of the                                 field will obviously be different for                                 the page that your own there in that of                                 course assumes we're talking about node                                 pages and that type of things for things                                 where you might want to stage stage                                 changes or in terms of placement on like                                 a view page for that type of thing you'd                                 have to go through some a little more                                 customization there since there's no                                 real underlying revision to the to the                                 view I think I mean display sweet                                 doesn't do content immediately I think                                 panoply doesn't kind of mixture of it                                 and this place we only does layouts and                                 I think I think every module here is                                 like dependent on ctools and has                                 exportable support by default which is                                 good if you don't do that start doing it                                 now but basically if you if the client                                 wants another layout then you can just                                 make your changes on your dev                                 environment then run the exportable                                 thing that sito's does then put it in                                 your posit or e go to staging do well                                 and then basically revert it or update                                 will revert the exportable which has the                                 display settings in them so that's                                 basically how we are doing like                                 previewing or making changes to websites                                 I guess so but I think that applies to                                 like every module in a way I think                                 hello you guys can ask questions too                                 Frank isn't happy lonely person yeah                                 there wasn't my guys please that's                                 questions um yeah so since everything                                 that my solution proposes around the                                 node it supports anything that's in a                                 revision so that was actually reason why                                 we did it in first place so for instance                                 the workbench interview any revision                                 scheduler or state machine all those                                 modules control work flow around the                                 publishing of particular vision as far                                 as previewing content before it's live                                 that's actually interesting because we                                 actually this the question is not staged                                 I promise um we actually just built and                                 released a module called site preview                                 system SPS which is built part of the                                 large-scale group one project that                                 allows you to take no revisions and                                 stages them to be pushed to push live on                                 a single site and also allows you to                                 preview any revision based upon a                                 collection tag so so for example so for                                 example we have a you doing a election                                 results of a round your versus Obama and                                 Obama's going win and you want to stage                                 all your content on your site and you                                 have the same same like page using a                                 page in tulalip we're all using pages or                                 layouts you want different revisions of                                 that layout so even using context the                                 context field module which is actually                                 now supports revisions I hope you do it                                 or not you did that okay you can                                 actually stage layout changes on the fly                                 using this module with any of these                                 solutions and ex works with panels also                                 we've actually tested with panel and it                                 works great so you can display entire                                 site like it's going to be live at a                                 certain point in time what's not                                 necessary related it is related to your                                 layout as far as all these solutions                                 support it cuz routes there they are                                 based around content which is how you                                 get revisions so microphone                                 I'll repeat it                                 I                                 each one but kind of step away from your                                 developer                                 so the question is as a non technical                                 user how would you go about making a                                 decision between these for these four                                 solutions just use display sweep no                                 mistake I don't ever think there's ever                                 a single solution for any problem                                 because I think that's closing all your                                 options if you always say one solution                                 always fixes a single problem all these                                 have wonderful use cases if you're                                 building a site where it's there's a                                 short development period the solutions I                                 proposed are mainly around higher                                 development teams larger projects we                                 have a lot of a lot of customizations a                                 lot of code still behind it if you want                                 something that's works great on the Box                                 kenapa Lee is probably the best solution                                 for in which you know just to throw up a                                 you know quick community site or                                 something I think they were probably                                 rate solution in my in my opinion in                                 context as well with some of the                                 distributions we have out to but it                                 depends on how much data element support                                  you want to do you wanted to allow                                  development support you want a lot of                                  control you want i would say use mine                                  but I love these guys say yeah it's a                                  tough question it's true um I mean what                                  yeah I mean there's been like in good in                                  the beginning in this place week was                                  released there was like this thing hey                                  justice this is panels I mean if or this                                  is going to be like a competitor of                                  panels which is actually not really true                                  I mean the only two people at that point                                  and understood to exit the exact                                  difference at that point was Earl and me                                  and everyone in the world was fighting                                  against I mean fighting hey I used                                  panels no usually have to use this place                                  we'd now they're doing the same thing                                  actually no I'm my opinion panels is a                                  layer builder and then you have all                                  these kinds of solutions like page                                  manager and it uses the panels layer                                  builder and to use to create layouts I                                  guess that's that's basically it and                                  this place we'd is is I think one on one                                  other key difference i think is                                  displacement doesn't work or act on the                                  global page level                                  I guess I mean if you have an entity                                  which which I mean for instance if you                                  look at monopoly you can drag in a note                                  in your right side bar and then select                                  View mode like pretty new view mode                                  called cyber and then the actual display                                  of that node in cyber in panoply or in                                  panels that that layout you are going to                                  configure and on the entity level thing                                  so that's the way that we choose and but                                  you can really use them together I mean                                  and I would say to kind of answer the                                  question between all these it really                                  depends on who's going to be building                                  your site out if developers are building                                  your site out you might want to use a                                  more developer from centric tool like                                  template field and beam if you want just                                  regular like kind of traditional                                  webmasters to build out the site I mean                                  a lot of the tools that come with                                  monopoly look really really easy to use                                  for those people so kind of evaluating                                  who your user basis is another another                                  step yeah I was just going to add that                                  like open Academy actually used as both                                  panoply and display sweet to accomplish                                  it sort of like custom design because                                  this place weeds great for creating                                  these these like custom rich view modes                                  and then panoply let's use fun tool sets                                  pick the view modes and that that's a                                  great combination to implement a complex                                  layout but like still allow for a lot of                                  like end-user customization but I think                                  answer the question I mean it's going to                                  depend on your use case and depend how                                  much end user interaction you need after                                  the fact and also like what your team                                  knows how to develop against you know                                  like they're these solutions all have                                  different like you mean if you know how                                  to do panels and you're into that like                                  it's a lot easier if you're starting off                                  new it's really complicated panoply                                  helps to get you a certain degree there                                  but like if you know context really well                                  like you only have next time you need to                                  develop the thing and so if you know the                                  tool you know really well sometimes the                                  best tool although hopefully they'll all                                  change four da so having having done                                  like I've used I haven't used every                                  single one of these tools but early on                                  in contexts life time I used it and                                  panels together a lot but you know I                                  think like for me at least the answer to                                  your question is that you use the one                                  you're comfortable with what you                                  need to do is you need to invest in one                                  of them and the investment is different                                  right like context is very capable if it                                  serves like in ninety percent of your                                  use cases maybe that's all you've ever                                  need you right out the template file for                                  the other ten percent or something you                                  know if you fundamentally need something                                  that's like it's a lot more to learn but                                  might give you you know a bigger payoff                                  maybe you go and you learn page manager                                  and panels or something like that and                                  each one of these solutions has their                                  their up and downs and you know it's                                  really just about investing in one of                                  them I think and kind of going forward                                  obviously in Drupal                                                       unify that so that everybody can invest                                  in the same one but yeah sure hi I'm Sam                                  I maintained panels so I would criticize                                  panels for a minute here there are there                                  are one thing it actually hasn't been                                  mentioned in the scope of this                                  discussion at all is one thing that                                  panels provides that others don't is a                                  framework for caching and scaling that                                  the other systems are not interested in                                  but God this as far as I know but it                                  provides hook points for doing granular                                  caching of selected elements in a way                                  that none of these other systems provide                                  so if you need to design like if you                                  have needs for doing some more high                                  performance stuff or saying we've got a                                  really expensive view over here and you                                  know that views caching itself is                                  problematic then you might want to look                                  at doing you want to look at using                                  panels simply for that reason that in                                  addition to being a layout builder it's                                  also a display framework that allows for                                  the granular caching of different parts                                  of the page the drawback since i said i                                  was going to criticize the situation                                  that i tend to see happening on a lot of                                  clients sites is people build out                                  they'll they'll you know they'll add a                                  new custom page here there and then                                  they're like                                                             that page that is an unmaintained will                                  situation so you might want to consider                                  not using panels or a panels page                                  manager approach if                                  if you're likely to if you're likely to                                  have a lot of variations that would                                  result in just you know like one or two                                  off tweaks that actually that that type                                  of thing you're probably going to be                                  able to handle a little bit better with                                  context because you can get yourself                                  into a really untenable unmanageable                                  situation with giant numbers of panels                                  pretty pretty easily so thank you                                  another question oh one more thing real                                  quick yeah just nursery we aren't we                                  aren't discussing it because none of us                                  are necessarily experts at it but rules                                  module can actually place flocks and                                  regions as well just FYI I just quickly                                  wanted to second on on the comment                                  before because like you can push in the                                  content very very nicely with with                                  context module and but in panels you                                  just have you have to create another                                  variant for every like thing that's a                                  little bit different and I wanted to see                                  what what are the plans for Drupal                                       for those different approaches so there                                  are like that's a very nuanced question                                  and the answer will be nuanced as well                                  that panel Iser actually buys us an                                  awful lot there because like the way it                                  approaches quote unquote variance is                                  totally different it determines it                                  through you know there's actually just                                  like if you actually look in page                                  manager there'll be a panel Iser variant                                  that sits at the top of any of the                                  places that can be penalized and it                                  makes the decisions before it wraps off                                  to any other variants so hopefully that                                  significantly reduces the number of                                  variants you need for nodes or users or                                  anything like that and then if you've                                  used panels everywhere panels everywhere                                  also has like a separate page that just                                  is the default one if there is no page                                  like you know lay out specific to a                                  particular URL and so like it's the                                  combination of all those things together                                  that can significantly reduce the number                                  of variants you actually                                  need on a page-by-page basis so like we                                  fully admit that it it might be an issue                                  the other thing to consider is that the                                  router if if whiskey delivers everything                                  it's trying to deliver the router will                                  be a lot more capable and nuanced as                                  well and so we might even be able to                                  remove say if if you were if you had no                                  type variance you know                                             article                                                               that might actually be up a level and                                  not on like a node % node page there                                  might actually end up being specific                                  pages dedicated to those because the the                                  router can determine that information                                  earlier I don't know how that will shake                                  out we kind of have to figure out what                                  we're all the connecting points are                                  there and leverage it appropriately and                                  that's still all in development so any                                  other audience questions yeah go yeah                                  sorry can you hang on that I just wanted                                  to tag on the response to last question                                  I apologize fundam of the problem of                                  panels is that yeah you create a new                                  variant and because you've got you've                                  got multiple layouts being used all over                                  your site whereas most what we do in                                  Drupal right now is we have one layout                                  that we bend a lot I believe that's                                  that's Earl's way of describing it I                                  have not given up on the on the idea                                  that we're going to have a system for                                  doing more global injection that's more                                  like the blocks interface right now so                                  we'll kind of get to have our cake and                                  eat it too I don't think it's impossible                                  it's going to be tricky but it that will                                  be the thing that that makes it much                                  easier for us to not have to just spin                                  off tons of new variants you globally                                  configure this block is going to show up                                  on a bunch of these paises pages and                                  then you've got all the full local                                  control over the panel that actually                                  runs with a panel e thing that actually                                  runs that page so the question in the                                  back                                  so the question is the question is do do                                  all these solutions have ways to modify                                  the node edit form so yeah actually on                                  the table field does um I showed filling                                  out the input definitions those actually                                  build out the node editor interface so                                  those are under /                                                         it does we know we know what is plays                                  listen I I mean I'll at an idea I forgot                                  one module that also ships with this                                  place with if you downloaded that is in                                  the display sweet forms that X on any                                  kind of entity form in your Drupal                                    installation i would say for context it                                  depends on whether or not you're                                  triggering layout based on something                                  attached to the node right so if there's                                  if there's a value in a field that                                  you're using to say I want two columns                                  for three columns or four columns then                                  you just add that feel to the node and                                  you have a condition that that watches                                  for it in the reaction that it takes                                  care of you know subbing in a template                                  or that type of thing but there's not                                  there's not sort of out of the box                                  something in context that's going to                                  inject itself into no data forms panels                                  is really good for doing overriding of                                  the node edit forms and if you get into                                  sort of real custom administrated                                  screens you can have different know that                                  forms for different node types and                                  actually drag and drop the fields around                                  panoply actually ships with this as the                                  default mode edit screen which is                                  actually a two column panel but it can                                  be extended obviously for different use                                  cases so this will look a lot like what                                  it's going to look like in Drupal                                       terms of having stuff on the left which                                  is sort of about your content and stuff                                  on the right that's more sort of data                                  about it but that um this is something                                  that I when I was doing a lot of                                  professional services would customize                                  for every site just because the Drupal                                  no title screen like honest it's not                                  that good and if you can like actually                                  just drag and drop the fields around in                                  ways that actually make a lot of sense                                  it's it's really powerful and that's                                  just to create a variant against note at                                  it and if you want to see a panoply as                                  an example of how to do one but you can                                  extend that for any node type or any                                  condition you want                                  sure I haven't played a lot with the                                  panoply but is it right that since it's                                  using feel double pains that you store                                  field data in a different way so to be                                  kind of hard to move back to the more                                  standard way of managing fields and                                  content types the I mean in terms of the                                  panoply like the lot of the widgets I                                  showed like the map and the spotlight                                  those are actually feel double panel                                  pains which are just an entities that                                  have obviously fields attached to them                                  but those are sort of in addition to the                                  standard node types like this is just a                                  standard no type title and body and that                                  actually will work and can be panelized                                  like that the fuel panel pains are more                                  sort of additions for sidebars or other                                  pieces of content I wouldn't see it's                                  sort of more of an extension to what you                                  already have as opposed to replacement                                  for anything and on that topic we have                                  every intention of putting that into                                  core any other questions we're just have                                  a couple minutes left and there is if                                  anybody doesn't want to ask a question                                  in the in the big room that we have                                  there is the box that are happening yeah                                  so where are we doing the ball off his                                  in the Montreal room immediately                                  following this that is is that in this                                  do we know is that Miss build it's in                                  the other building you didn't put the                                  map on here because we weren't using a                                  novel either drop about it just got a                                  quick question one more question so what                                  about controlling lairds in themes                                  versus controlling layouts and modules                                  for those different approaches panels                                  can do that                                  yeah a panel like you can define layouts                                  and your themes and panels will pick                                  those up where you can define them in                                  modules I don't have a strong preference                                  either way for context on the context                                  layouts module is actually for that so                                  your theme would say I have these                                  particular layouts and these layouts                                  have these regions and that would be                                  primarily the way that it interacts with                                  themes if you would like if you are                                  using two themes on one website and at                                  this at this point it is not possible                                  for displaced wait till you say the view                                  mode of this article looks like this on                                  that team and something else on the                                  other theme so that's not possible it's                                  it's also kind of a it's a field API                                  problem storage problem which I probably                                  won't be able to say it solve any way                                  for Drupal                                                               that so I did also want to mention if                                  you're using a theme like Omega like the                                  Delta module where the theme itself has                                  lots of settings for controlling the                                  layout bill that comes with something                                  for context to control it that way as                                  well I don't believe in using themes so                                  somebody else's job on it to know um in                                  the courts course solution so mines                                  around course so it's just your note no                                  GPL files and using few modes a lot is a                                  very big part of the art my solution of                                  the notice using you're using view modes                                  and and GPS on the view modes really so                                  well so that's it we're out of time I                                  want to thank the panelists for being up                                  here thanks everybody
