Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Building interconnected sites with HTML5's microdata
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	We're moving to a new level of interconnectivity between Web pages. New Web development techniques are being pushed forward by search engines like Google and Bing, helping machines understand the connections and correlations between pages that only humans could process before. This is helping the search giants redefine search, but what a lot of people don't know is that microdata isn't just for SEO. It also gives you the tools to build cool mashups and linked data apps that use the Web as their database.

This session will show how you can use microdata for its SEO benefits, getting Rich Snippet results from Google and others (which increase click-through rates by 15-30%). You will then learn how you can reuse that effort to expose your data for mashups and build your own interconnected Web of sites.
