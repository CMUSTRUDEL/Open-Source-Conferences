Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Death, Taxes & 'Viewport Chrome': How to Design for Uncertainty
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Some things in life are certain: death, taxes, and -- if you're a web professional -- the inability to know the capabilities, access speed and dimensions of the viewport through which your design is viewed. Welcome to your future. As a designer, it's essential to know how your content and design will be consumed (or perceived) before you can prepare its presentation. Drupal can easily deliver on the technology and content management, but as a designer you need to know how design in quicksand and create buildable, sustainable designs that will move and scale from the smallest screens to the largest.

It's a brave new world, and you can't forget that you're designing a system, not a page. Step up and take charge: The future IS the system.
