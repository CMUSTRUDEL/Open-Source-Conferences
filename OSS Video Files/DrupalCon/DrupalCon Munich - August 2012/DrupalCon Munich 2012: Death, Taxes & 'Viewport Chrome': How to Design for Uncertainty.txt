Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Death, Taxes & 'Viewport Chrome': How to Design for Uncertainty
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Some things in life are certain: death, taxes, and -- if you're a web professional -- the inability to know the capabilities, access speed and dimensions of the viewport through which your design is viewed. Welcome to your future. As a designer, it's essential to know how your content and design will be consumed (or perceived) before you can prepare its presentation. Drupal can easily deliver on the technology and content management, but as a designer you need to know how design in quicksand and create buildable, sustainable designs that will move and scale from the smallest screens to the largest.

It's a brave new world, and you can't forget that you're designing a system, not a page. Step up and take charge: The future IS the system.

	                              all right well um like we'll get started                               I'm sure there'll be a few people                               trickling in here and there but that's                               quite all right                               okay um hello welcome to after lunch                               hopefully this is far enough after the                               hangover that everybody's starting to                               focus a little bit got some food haven't                               fallen asleep yet hope we can stave that                                off a little bit i'm happy that enough                                of you got past the title to still come                                and hear the talk um I maybe being a                                little bit too clever but I think that                                it's really important that given all of                                the things that are going on in web                                design that we figure out what we don't                                know and what things we can count on and                                that's really what this this talk is                                about um so a little bit about me I know                                there's at least one or two people who                                have seen me give a talk before and                                again I thank you for actually coming                                back and I've been doing this kind of                                thing for a very long time this is front                                end track I think of myself primarily as                                a designer but I've also done a lot of                                technology stuff over the years I've                                been working with Drupal for a number of                                years and I have built lots of                                large-scale sites with it but in the end                                I I think of it as much as another                                pencil in my toolbox as as rather than                                the be-all and the focus of what I do so                                so that really kind of informs my own                                perspective about how I think about                                design what I use Drupal for and and why                                I whenever I come to a Drupal conference                                to talk the things that I like to focus                                on or maybe not so directly related to                                Drupal but hopefully for the crowd in                                this room something that really helps                                you leverage Drupal to further what you                                want to do as a designer and that is                                then getting to a bit of an assumption                                that there are actually a bunch of                                designers in the room so let's find out                                how many of you are primarily                                considering yourself a designer that's a                                really small number so I have I have                                nowhere to go but up by the end of this                                talk to get more of you to think of                                yourself as a designer and so how many                                people are primarily front-end develop                                okay I've got a bunch more and then any                                other people that happen to wander in                                i'm assuming developers site owners i                                know there's at least one I met this                                morning at breakfast and and developers                                I assume great and educators because we                                all know that we need more people that                                can actually do stuff with Drupal so we                                need more people like a so I'm going to                                talk about responsive design a lot I'm                                going to talk about a lot of the things                                that have to go into doing responsive                                design before you can actually start to                                do that but I want to make it very clear                                this isn't supposed to be a talk about                                responsive design there's lots of people                                doing that lots of tools out there to                                help you do that but I think that we                                have to consider that responsive                                approach versus an appt centric approach                                or a bespoke mobile theme because that's                                going to kill you I mean there are over                                                                                                 there's about                                                          of iOS and operating systems and devices                                all of these things are only growing and                                we have to come up with a way to think                                about design and think about what we're                                trying to accomplish and get it to the                                platform and get it to the user so I                                want to talk about what is the design                                that comes before you pick up something                                to do your design and I think this is                                probably the most important part                                important homework you can do so I've                                thought and spoken and written a lot                                about web strategy and that's one of the                                talks that I give fairly regularly about                                what is the bit between design and                                technology in the client and oftentimes                                drupal's are really good glue for that                                and there's only one thing that I can                                say is the same having been building                                websites since mosaic and Netscape one                                is that something's going to be changing                                every day and and because of that                                 shifting                                 scape it requires you to be very                                 flexible in the way you think about                                 design what you think about the output                                 is going to be of your design so the                                 title there are some things that we know                                 for sure probably going to be true as                                 well unless you live in perhaps a pirate                                 bay I don't know but this third point is                                 the one that is most germane this is the                                 thing that we have to accept that we                                 don't know we have to because you can't                                 tell when you're sitting there designing                                 or when you're managing the site you                                 don't know what's on the other end and                                 you can't no not really I mean all the                                 detection all of that other stuff that                                 we can try and build in is fallible all                                 of it                                                                 how many months of the existence of the                                 ipad it reported itself as an iphone so                                 you couldn't even look at a user agent                                 string and know that the screen was four                                 times larger than the other device so                                 those are tricks to get us by what we                                 have to do is actually think about what                                 we're trying to accomplish as a designer                                 and and how to convey that in this                                 shifting landscape so we've got a lot of                                 things that are changing that have been                                 changing we have a lot of new                                 developments that have made web design a                                 lot more fun but we have this other                                 aspect to deal with about how many                                 different ways people can view stuff and                                 that makes this a really big turning                                 point so in the past year we've started                                 to see in a number of countries this has                                 been true in some places longer but                                 we're starting to see it be true in many                                 countries that there are more people                                 accessing the web through a mobile                                 device than a computer so that really                                 changes things but we also know that you                                 can buy a car that has apps in it you                                 can buy a TV that has apps in it you can                                 use the TV as the screen for your laptop                                 and that gives you a                                                    which to put content how's your                                          going to look                                 that you know there's like a lot of                                 really significant questions that you                                 have to think about you know and we got                                 here through this litany of stuff that                                 went from no tables and aligning                                 graphics to tables to making graphics                                 out of your text to being able to                                 finally specify Ariel instead of                                 verdanta or anything else to actually                                 using some real fonts and in responsive                                 design has sort of taken that even                                 further so we've got all of these tools                                 that have been developing and all of                                 those things mean we get to use tools                                 like like Kota less and sass and compass                                 and you know all of these great things                                 that have come along that are cheap easy                                 to use really prevalent really easy to                                 support there's lots of ways for us to                                 actually get this stuff on the web why                                 the rolling it ourselves are using a                                 service and you have more power                                 available to you as an individual                                 designer or developer than just ever                                 before thought possible so I was                                 involved in two thousand i'm at a                                 company in Boston building a site for                                 the new england patriots a football team                                 i'm an american football team and that                                 cost the company five hundred thousand                                 dollars to build and that was reusing                                 code it's shocking now flash forward                                    years and a team of two other developers                                 and myself built the entire website for                                 CVS caremark of fortune                                               company built in drupal we did the                                 front-end development of that in five                                 weeks so you could never have done                                 something like this prior to the advent                                 of something like drupal and that really                                 is something that's wonderful about                                 where we are but it also brings with it                                 this question this question that has                                 never been answered and now it has more                                 answers than it ever has before so if                                 you don't know any of these things and                                 and you can't really deal with                                 I'm that control that you want to impose                                 in your design what are the things that                                 you have to do in order to get by and                                 not just get by that actually excel at                                 the process of designing a website and                                 doing what a website and helping a                                 website do what it's supposed to do that                                 brings us to a very important paradigm                                 shift in the design thinking process is                                 that we're no longer designing a page                                 because that page is not a static thing                                 it has to have structure we have to                                 think about a visual system of elements                                 that are on that page quote unquote but                                 that system of hierarchy has to be                                 something that we can preserve based on                                 the fact that we can't count on that                                 answer anymore we never really could but                                 we sort of lied to ourselves and said                                 that was okay for a while because that                                 was our best guess and that's just not                                 possible to think about it that way more                                 so we're not designing pages we're                                 designing meaning and I think this is a                                 really critical critical concept for you                                 to think about is that you are taking                                 the notion of that page deconstructing                                 it thinking about what are the most                                 important elements on it how do you need                                 to guide somebody's I through it to get                                 them to the content to understand with                                 this page or this site is supposed to                                 convey so that has to work under any                                 circumstance so if you pin everything to                                 a                                                                     not really because you have bigger                                 screens and you have smaller ones and                                 you have different ways of interacting                                 so we have to start thinking about                                 decoupling our presentation of that from                                 conceptually what is the most important                                 thing we're trying to present start with                                 semantics there's lots of carrying on                                 about the Semantic Web the value of                                 semantically constructed code and what                                 that means to convey understanding it's                                 just as important for that to be there                                 so a search engine knows it but it also                                 lets you think about                                 conceptually what are the important                                 things you want to convey on a given                                 device so once you start planning that                                 way and you start doing the kinds of                                 things that help you make that list and                                 prioritize it here are the elements on                                 the page and this is how I want to lay                                 them out because it's important that the                                 user get them in this order then you can                                 start to construct some ideas about how                                 that might work when the screen is very                                 small versus very large so psychology is                                 a very important factor in this and it's                                 something that I think is is critically                                 absent in design education and so I                                 think unless you understand what                                 motivates people to do things it's very                                 hard to design things to get them to do                                 it because color shape size contrast all                                 of those things influence how people                                 take in information so understanding                                 these things I think is really important                                 so reading books like don't make me                                 think like the design of everyday things                                 like neuro web design it's actually a                                 great little book about the psychology                                 behind ecommerce websites those things                                 all help inform you as a designer to                                 think about the strategies you will use                                 to get someone to the point on the page                                 to do something so once you understand                                 those things those motivators the                                 drivers to get people to take action you                                 can start to design for them you can                                 tailor that system of hierarchy that                                 you're thinking about from your page and                                 then transform that into something that                                 works on a smaller or larger screen                                 I don't mean to make too many off-color                                 jokes but it does it does make a good                                 sound bite it really does matter how big                                 or little something is on the screen                                 because we're drawn to that contrast so                                 attention is something that you need to                                 grab it's something that you need to                                 take from that user because oftentimes                                 they have the device in their hand while                                 they're doing something else it's very                                 rare actually that you have someone's                                 full attention usually there's a cup of                                 coffee or two other windows or the work                                 that they're supposed to be doing or the                                 work that they'd rather be doing or the                                 play that they'd rather be doing so                                 you're fighting for the attention of                                 that user and when you consider that                                 that also means you have to expand the                                 contrast of the things that you're                                 presenting in order to help combat that                                 divided attention so you have to think                                 about where your design is being seen                                 and what's likely happening at that time                                 know your competition your competition                                 is not the other website it's the other                                 tasks so it's the other things that are                                 going on in that person's life when                                 they're looking at your design and that                                 location drastically alters what those                                 other things may be so if you think                                 about a desktop it's usually at a desk                                 you probably have the most focus when                                 somebody is sitting at a desk top                                 because the likelihood is they have sat                                 down very purposefully to do something                                 on their computer and at the time that                                 happens to be looking at the website                                 that you designed laptops are going to                                 be anywhere I mean they're going to be                                 in a coffee shop and be sitting outside                                 on a bench you don't really know how                                 much attention you're going to get there                                 and whether or not it's really                                 purposeful and directed or grazing just                                 kind of skimming across lots of things                                 it gets worse so tablets if you look at                                 the usage and overall during the day of                                 iPads or other tablet devices big spike                                 around seven eight o'clock in the                                 morning nothing                                 big spike after five o'clock so what is                                 that what can you infer from that                                 information is that these things are on                                 a couch there next to somebody when                                 they're watching television it's with                                 them in bed you know they might be                                 reading some email or picking something                                 up to like read I read some news or                                 something first thing in the morning or                                 right before they go to bed there's no                                 usage during the day or very little                                 certainly drops way off phones are                                 everywhere in between so you get tons of                                 usage and tons of data that goes through                                 that go through phones but in very short                                 periodic bursts and so those short                                 periodic bursts are when you're waiting                                 in line when you're stopped at a traffic                                 light when you are waiting to cross the                                 street so that's a very different usage                                 pattern so now you have to think about                                 how big is this screen how much                                 attention do I have and what are the                                 other things that that person is likely                                 to be doing or what state of mind are                                 they going to be in when they are using                                 and engaging with that device and                                 therefore your design tablets that you                                 know I think you can you can infer a                                 different state of mind because it's in                                 that off our time of day now that's                                 maybe a dangerous assumption but if you                                 have to make some assumptions somewhere                                 then that's probably a reasonable one                                 based on the data of the usage of the                                 device phones again it's just a very                                 different story so because of all of                                 those different factors in all of those                                 different scenarios you actually have to                                 think very carefully about how much or                                 how little of that person's attention do                                 you have when you are going to be                                 working on getting them to do something                                 because that's what all of our websites                                 are about is getting people to do                                 something it might be to read it might                                 be to engage it might be to buy or might                                 be to just simply change their opinion                                 and all you know you want to actually                                 succeed in those tasks and and they're                                 coming to your site to do to perform a                                 task as well so that focus and attention                                 should be driving your design decisions                                 and those design decisions some of them                                 will be universal                                 and some of them will be very tailored                                 to the different platforms where you                                 know it will be consumed and that                                 reality is something that you can escape                                 and either you need to have a plan to do                                 apps a plan to do a separate mobile                                 theme or work with a responsive design                                 that's up to you but the reality is                                 you've got to do it so it's all relative                                 and and that is applicable sort of                                 across the whole spectrum relative                                 meaning you have more attention compared                                 to something else or less also it                                 matters on the screen this element is                                 larger than the other one relative to                                 everything else around it that will                                 assign a certain amount of importance so                                 that relationship that scale                                 relationship may change on the screw                                 based on screen size but the importance                                 that's conveyed by this being slightly                                 bigger or above or a different color has                                 to translate the size may change you                                 might use a different size typeface when                                 you're on a very small screen actually                                 amazed a larger one than you do on a                                 larger screen simply because you need to                                 again expand the contrast when you have                                 little attention so that's why apps that                                 design is so successful when they've got                                 these big fat buttons to push because                                 there's few elements fighting for                                 attention and you direct him to very                                 focused tasks this is more about tool                                 box so as a designer or a front-end                                 developer you have to make choices about                                 what is the thing going on the screen                                 and how do you get that attention how                                 does something get more attention than                                 something else and you have various                                 tools you've got color font font                                 variants whether it's bold whether it's                                 italicized and then you have different                                 kinds of visual cues that you can assign                                 two links our links a different color                                 are they underlined do they have a                                 dotted line or a solid one what are the                                 things that you can do to draw attention                                 or assign prominence to something or                                 take it away because that's also                                 important to a simple little thing we're                                 emphasizing and de-emphasizing is a                                 really good                                 there's a really good sort of you I                                 pattern that's evolved is saving or                                 cancel when you have a content                                 management system most of the time                                 people want to save so that's a button                                 rarely they want to cancel make that a                                 link so one has a larger hit state and a                                 larger amount of prominence because it                                 is the more likely course of action and                                 you want to make the editing process                                 smoother but you don't want to take away                                 an important function to let people know                                 they can back out of it they still                                 should be together but one should be the                                 more natural inclination so you want to                                 support the intended task with the                                 decisions you make in the design so                                 knowing those tools is really critical                                 and then thinking about how those tools                                 are going to change and how you need to                                 use them differently based on how much                                 screen real estate you have to work with                                 really does make a big difference so                                 again it comes back to psychology so we                                 we learn and we notice things by the                                 contrast something has with its                                 surroundings the horn honked close by is                                 going to get your attention more than                                 the general city noise where you may                                 hear lots of horns but it's not the one                                 that's about to clip you in the shin so                                 there are certain things about proximity                                 about size these are the things that                                 draw RI so when you get on to a page and                                 there's a lot of sort of dark grey text                                 and then there's a big green or blue                                 button that's going to catch your eye so                                 if you have you know the form to fill                                 out what's the one element that they                                 need to see after they filled out the                                 form well it's the submit button so you                                 have to think about what are the ways                                 you can draw persons persons I to the                                 completion point of that task and                                 contrast is going to be the way that                                 you're going to do that so that's why an                                 h                                                                        paragraph because it has semantically                                 more importance it's the thing that                                 tells you what a page is about but                                 visually you also need to support that                                 importance in a way that people will                                 understand conventions so I think                                 there's a lot                                 to talk about here and unfortunately                                 Anna Lee can give it about three lines                                 but there are a lot of conventions that                                 have emerged on the web links are blue                                 visited links or purple if you want to                                 go forward with an action you're going                                 to use an arrow and you're going to use                                 a blue or a green color usually those                                 are the kind of the more positive motion                                 colors and if you don't want somebody to                                 do something you'll want to slow them                                 down before they take that action you're                                 going to make it red because in most                                 cultures and again it's most it's                                 admittedly that is a cultural specific                                 thing that color is a cautionary color                                 so someone's going to click on it                                 they're going to click on it but they're                                 going to think about it just that                                 fraction of a second longer and that may                                 be all you need to guide them into a                                 different action or maybe that's exactly                                 what you want but those those things can                                 be good and they can be bad so you can                                 use them to reduce the mental load so                                 that they can make a decision faster                                 without thinking about it that's you                                 know the the way you described using an                                 iphone to most people is that you don't                                 have to think because they have done                                 everything they can to reduce that                                 cognitive barrier to action they have                                 just made it simple you think less about                                 an apple product you can usually use it                                 better and I think that's true of most                                 of the things they do and I think that's                                 why their designs overall are so                                 successful is that they've taken the                                 time to understand how we think how we                                 learn how we behave and tie into those                                 conventions and use those to make the                                 process of onboarding of learning that                                 new product so simple that a two or                                 three year old is picking the picking                                 their parents iPhone up and playing with                                 them in a matter of seconds doing things                                 that the parent didn't even know they                                 could do we can also defy them because                                 that's another thing about contrast is                                 that if you're always doing what's                                 expected it's still going to end up                                 boring it's when you follow those things                                 to make it an easy-to-use interface and                                 then have these things that suddenly pop                                 up that are unexpected that you can                                 achieve some real delight you can really                                 engage people in a way that they weren't                                 expecting                                 and make them remember something more by                                 using something slightly out of context                                 using something that is slightly                                 different than the expected way of doing                                 things so think about things you don't                                 think about I know that's kind of a                                 mouthful it's hard to kind of take that                                 in but if you think about how you engage                                 with a website and all of the tasks that                                 you accomplish from going and paying                                 your bills online to going by music to                                 going to your favorite website to read                                 up on some news what are the tasks that                                 you do there that you're not thinking                                 about why you're doing or how you're                                 doing them and you can start to decode                                 what the conventions are that you could                                 use to support those courses of action                                 or where you might want to redirect by                                 doing things just a little bit                                 differently so i mentioned tasks earlier                                 and this is another thing that i think                                 is really important about thinking about                                 where your design is consumed what are                                 the UI controls available and the                                 conventions for their use and and                                 knowing that we have access to media                                 queries that will tell us the screen                                 size so we can make some pretty solid                                 assumptions about the device that it's                                 being viewed on based on those those                                 resolution ranges that we can think                                 about the tasks that somebody is going                                 to need to accomplish based on that                                 context of use now you can't really go                                 too far down that road because you can't                                 really know what somebody is trying to                                 do on your website just because of their                                 screen resolution but you can make some                                 inferences about how they'll interact                                 with it so a list of utility links along                                 the top of the screen might add a                                 smaller size turn into an overlay with                                 very large icons so if utility links are                                 things that people are supposed to                                 access frequently and easily how are you                                 going to accomplish that on a very small                                 screen you can't leave them as a little                                 list of links because that's going to be                                 too small for people to access and read                                 these are things that are meant to be                                 very quick action and this is why apps                                 are so successful is that they can                                 narrow that focus                                 attention and center the people on those                                 particular tasks you can do that with                                 HTML very easily tapping to bring a                                 layer down that has using it's the exact                                 same markup just applying different                                 classes different backgrounds different                                 scale different positioning based on the                                 media query so you can think about that                                 difference in you I based on the                                 available real estate and mode of input                                 that's really important so on there's                                 always a place for things like utility                                 links that place is just going to move                                 and again that's also going to be                                 relative to the importance of the tasks                                 at hand and I think that's where you                                 want to think about the intended use of                                 the site and the intended use based on                                 the the device in which you're viewing                                 it so josh Clark I don't know if any of                                 you have seen josh Clark talk but he                                 wrote a book called tap worthy he's real                                 it's all about what makes a great iPad                                 or iPhone app but one of the things that                                 he said that I really sort of resonated                                 for me was that anytime somebody is                                 interacting with your site on a mobile                                 device what that's really saying is they                                 have a little attention to spend they've                                 made a decision to go to this website                                 and they have some time either standing                                 in line or they're sitting on the couch                                 and they want to do something with this                                 website but you have to think about how                                 so Luke Wroblewski had this great way of                                 describing it in designing for mobile                                 first one I on one thumb you have at                                 most half of someone's attention and one                                 digit with which they're interacting                                 with your site so they're walking around                                 and they're doing this and exactly what                                 i'm doing and using this so that's my                                 method of interaction and that says very                                 little of my attention right now so                                 thankfully Apple was good enough with                                 this app that I don't need to do                                 anything more than that but swiped my                                 thumb across um I'm not really sure                                 where the quote came from but roughly                                 speaking at paraphrases to there is no                                 mobile user                                 there is only a mobile device the user                                 is just a user they happen to have a                                 device that is small that they're                                 carrying with them but that doesn't mean                                 that you can make assumptions about what                                 they want to do on your website because                                 roughly speaking fifty percent of                                 internet access on a phone is still done                                 from a couch so watching TV and there's                                 an ad so they pick up their phone and                                 they're looking at male looking at                                 Twitter looking at Facebook so it's                                 these interstitial spaces that actually                                 have a lot of focus they may read it you                                 know it's very common for people to                                 actually read whole articles on phones                                 because they have this captive attention                                 span and they're interested so you don't                                 really you can't make an assumption                                 about how deep that attention will go                                 based on the device but what you can                                 assume is that it has to function in a                                 way that is appropriate to the device so                                 that you can present that content in a                                 way that they can engage with it when                                 they want to so I I kind of threw that                                 in there with the whole fold bit because                                 I just wanted to bring that up in terms                                 of our design process I know it's been                                 talked to death a little bit but it's                                 also important for us to be able to                                 present data about this to our clients                                 when clients ask about the fold so                                 there's no mobile user there's not                                 really a fold there is kinda but not                                 really people scroll people click on the                                 links in the bottom of pages all the                                 time what you have to consider a little                                 bit is the most common resolution and if                                 you look at analytics you can figure                                 that out if you use google analytics                                 what is the most common resolution that                                 is viewed on this device or what are the                                 several Kamose common ones check out                                 your website and those dimensions and                                 tailor it so that there's always                                 something halfway off the bottom of the                                 screen as long as people see that                                 there's something there it draws them                                 down it could be the top half of the                                 headline all it takes all it takes is to                                 remove that clear barrier at the bottom                                 of a photo so that they know that                                 there's more content it's just a little                                 down arrow                                 I mean that's really what it functions                                 as cognitively so that people understand                                 that there's more so there are a few                                 tricks to it I don't completely discount                                 the fact that having something on the                                 screen first is important but it's not                                 only so it's not to exclude everything                                 else and cram it all up into this one                                 little space and I was talking about                                 these tasks I think you want to consider                                 the why are they accomplished are they                                 here to do these tasks and how are they                                 going to accomplish them based on media                                 queries devices using moderniser to know                                 if the browser supports touch or not                                 there are lots of little tricks that we                                 can fall back on here to inform what we                                 do in these circumstances so let's look                                 at some examples a restaurant website                                 when you're on your phone the most                                 common things you're going to do with a                                 restaurant website on your phone I think                                 are going to be what can I eat and how                                 do I get there and kind of make a                                 reservation those are the three top most                                 used functions on any restaurants                                 website and then come photos then come                                 reviews then comes the other stuff about                                 it but you can be sure that with the                                 smallest amount of attention the most                                 important tasks rise to the top and                                 those are the ones that are immediately                                 trying to act on so those are the things                                 you want to bring to the fore the                                 smallest screen size but a non-profit                                 site on the desktop or laptop well                                 there's a whole different mindset in                                 engaging with that site when you have                                 more time to spend and a larger screen                                 in which to view it it's much more                                 likely that you're going to that website                                 on that size screen to do some research                                 and decide if you want to give to them                                 or see if they're for real or find out                                 if they might be someone who can benefit                                 a circumstance that you're in so there's                                 a very different usage pattern instead                                 of goals based on the mode of                                 interaction that's not to exclude and                                 you don't want what you're doing to                                 exclude use those other usage patterns                                 but                                 you have this other circumstance in the                                 middle where early doesn't matter which                                 way they're coming to it they're still                                 just want to buy the Ferrari I mean                                 there's still like weird statistic with                                 with ebay with the number of Ferraris                                 that have been sold through their mobile                                 app is astonishing I mean that's just                                 really weird I wish that I were that guy                                 or that woman I'm not um so these                                 contexts can usually coincide with                                 things you can reasonably assume based                                 on screen size and other factors but you                                 don't want to exclude it and that's why                                 I think responsive design is such a good                                 answer is that you can accentuate the                                 things that are important in that mode                                 of interaction based on touch based on                                 resolution but you don't have to exclude                                 things you can still get to the whole                                 website you just want to bring the                                 things to the four that are most likely                                 to be used in that use case and these                                 are all things that you can figure out                                 based on doing a little user research                                 talk to some people who actually our                                 customers or users of that of this                                 website and ask them I asked my kids all                                 the time what do they use their school                                 website for because that's a lot of the                                 work that I do is building websites for                                 schools so I've got this great little                                 test bed of all of these teenagers that                                 go to this website and I know exactly                                 what they need it for so if we're                                 designing a mobile way of thinking in                                 how we build our responsive themes I                                 already know what a lot of the top                                 things are that they want to do after                                 school so i can bring those tasks to the                                 fore by using one day's tricks like the                                 utility nav idea where you come into it                                 and you tap on that and kind of takes                                 over the screen it looks more like a nap                                 but they can still get to everything                                 else totally burns me the company that                                 made this with a website for their                                 school where my children attend force                                 you to the mobile website when you come                                 to it from your iPhone I've got a more                                 capable device in my hand than most                                 people have accessing it from their desk                                 and I can't get to the rest of the                                 website that is one of the dumbest                                 things I have ever seen it kills me and                                 I know how much this company charges for                                 this stuff and                                 kills me just kills me so the medium is                                 the web but you need to make sure that                                 you're responding to how people get to                                 that stuff and think about again you                                 know now we're going to talk a little                                 bit about what are the UI conventions                                 what are the things that you're going to                                 use so hover on a desktop or laptop aids                                 exploration it helps people find out                                 more about what the website can do and                                 can bring to them but that method of                                 interaction is completely absent on a                                 phone you can't do it you can but it                                 sucks so don't you know I mean I think                                 that's one of the things that you have                                 to accept so you have to think about how                                 else can I present navigation to allow                                 for that sense of browsing and exploring                                 in a method that actually makes sense so                                 you can think about doing stuff that                                 will take advantage of touching and                                 swiping and then also with this emerging                                 iconography that we're all starting to                                 understand about what means this will                                 get me the menu and it was in a really                                 interesting post from Jeremy Keith about                                 that recently about just that question                                 what is that one icon so we know a                                 little house right you see a little                                 house in the corner you're going to                                 click on that you can go to the homepage                                 easy um you see a little envelope it's                                 probably going to contact somebody via                                 email so there are these things that                                 have emerged again conventions one of                                 the ones that seems to be emerging                                 quickly is three horizontal lines and                                 that seems to do what a lot of people                                 are gravitating to to indicate menu so                                 if you look at the facebook app and the                                 facebook mobile site they use the same                                 one and they tap into a really                                 interesting you I pattern that I think                                 is really worth exploring because it                                 does get into that natural way of                                 interacting on a phone you tap that icon                                 the top layer slides to the side and                                 reveals your navigation now if you                                 coupled that with something like jqtouch                                 or jQuery Mobile those that navigation                                 could be the top level of your your UL                                 in your menu system and then tap to                                 slide to the right to explore and you                                 give people at browsing metaphor that                                 works really well on a phone only at                                 that smallest screen size where it will                                 really make sense and you could do it on                                 a tablet as well so that way just using                                 CSS to show or hide or pull in different                                 classes that are that are going to apply                                 based on those media queries then you                                 could change your whole way of                                 presenting navigation and then make it                                 more appropriate to the device at the                                 time so what I'm what I'm getting at is                                 we need to rethink how we think we                                 really need to sort of hit a reset                                 button stop thinking about opening up                                 Photoshop when we start our design                                 process throw it out you don't have to                                 uninstall it I won't go that far but                                 what you do need to do is buy some                                 sharpies buy some sharpies buy some                                 graph paper make yourself some templates                                 of all different screen sizes and go to                                 town when you first start a project make                                 a bunch of those different screen size                                 templates and you and you make this list                                 of what are your important elements in                                 that screen that screen at the time your                                 h                                                                     extra news articles whatever it is                                 you're trying to design make those                                 little that little like a widget list on                                 the side and when you start to design                                 this you look at those and you think all                                 right well if it's this size what are                                 the most important things that I need to                                 convey what is the job that this page                                 has to do in this context so a homepage                                 will need to do a number of things based                                 on that that the needs of that website                                 there's a hierarchy to that so order                                 your content accordingly so what's the                                 first thing they're going to see what's                                 the next and what's the next and so you                                 can then sketch that out and see if I                                 have this much screen space and I really                                 want to get these jobs accomplished what                                 am I going to present first sketch that                                 out no more fidelity than you can do                                 with a nice fat tip sharpie and then go                                 on to the next and the next and then you                                 can look at them all together and see if                                 across that spectrum which elements are                                 the ones                                 that are really sort of staying the same                                 and which ones are really changing so                                 that's how you can start to think about                                 where the breakpoints in your CSS so                                 it's not just about screen size but also                                 about hierarchy so you might have media                                 queries that are really dedicated to                                 large layout changes do I have one side                                 bar two or three and you might have                                 media queries that are actually tailored                                 to more break points in between so that                                 on a Kindle Fire you present things one                                 way because you only have                                            across but on an iPad and vertical                                 orientation you have about seven sixty                                 eight ish I mean it is that but the                                 browser is going to change that a little                                 bit so two tablets that are only                                     pixels apart in there wit look at them                                 it's a drastically different experience                                 they both have really high quality                                 screens they both have very fast                                 responsive you know touch times to see a                                 reaction they're both nice devices one                                 sells for two hundred dollars and there                                 are millions of them out there and it's                                 really growing quickly and then you've                                 got the ipad which costs two or three                                 times as much so those are very                                 different realities but they will fall                                 generally in the same media query much                                 of the time but they are really very                                 different and when I bought one because                                 I really wanted to see the two together                                 and I was shocked and it really changed                                 the way we did the design for mobile                                 stuff and we actually ended up lumping                                 the Kindle Fire more in the phone camp                                 than the tablet so you've got these like                                 six seven inch tablets that actually                                 have a very different mode of use than a                                 more full-size tablet like the ipad so                                 you know you have to see these things                                 and touch them and that's really going                                 to start to suggest how many of these                                 templates do you need don't forget the                                 bigger ones I think that that's                                 something that people are only now now                                 that we've done lots of responsive stuff                                 where some of us have you've gotten to                                 that point where we can start thinking                                 about what other direction does it go in                                 what about a blog that has the                                                                                                          instead of below you can do that if you                                 have a media query that's bigger what                                 about scrolling content sideways because                                 we have media queries that can tell the                                 height as well as the width so the new                                 york times app has a great UI scrolls to                                 the side and columns of text well guess                                 what we have columns and we have media                                 queries that can tell us the height in                                 css                                                               browser now so we can do that we don't                                 need a nap we actually have native                                 technologies that can support it so we                                 need to think about that direction too                                 and when we start to think about that                                 though that thought pattern those                                  processes that's going to apply on every                                  job so you know this isn't another thing                                  that you know trying to sort of drill                                  into people is if you start thinking                                  this way as a designer it is not just                                  for that one project the first one you                                  do is going to cost you more in thought                                  and time and building but if that                                  becomes your normal you now have a tool                                  set and a way of thinking that is going                                  to be completely natural on every                                  subsequent project and that's where you                                  really start to win because it is a fact                                  that twenty-five percent of internet                                  access in the u.s. is on a mobile device                                  in Japan it has been fact for almost ten                                  years that there has been more mobile                                  internet access than desktop it's                                  amazing and it's really starting to hit                                  that that tipping point of more mobile                                  than not worldwide and within a couple                                  of years that's probably going to be                                  much more normal so it's not mobile is                                  coming should we come up with some ideas                                  maybe it's already here and we're                                  already behind because you have to deal                                  with this huge variety of small screen                                  to large capabilities that are very                                  curtailed to thenns ones that are very                                  expansive so you have to start changing                                  how you design you have to start                                  changing how you think because just                                  downloading a theme is not going to get                                  you all the way there that is simply the                                  mechanics of putting things on the                                  screen                                  you still have to think about what are                                  the things you want to put there and how                                  are they going to change that's still up                                  to you you have to figure out hierarchy                                  out understand the interaction patterns                                  and start to use those things to make                                  appropriate design under all of these                                  circumstances so research lots of it you                                  know it's more than ever important to                                  browse it's important to analyze your                                  own internet usage so if you have all of                                  these devices at home which are the ones                                  that you use and when do you use them                                  analyze yourself make some notes and                                  start talking to more people and                                  building that library and then go to                                  websites like pattern tap pattern taps a                                  great website and there are many more                                  just to look up UI patterns for specific                                  things so how do people solve sidebar                                  navigation how do people solve portal                                  links how do people solve utility links                                  how do they solve for iconography these                                  things are all there you can search it                                  you can see lots of ideas so you have to                                  look at how sites are doing things now                                  so if you really like Omega or you                                  really like the new Zen you really like                                  some theme that will enable you to do                                  responsive design or if you want to                                  write your own you have to look at how                                  other people are doing it look at the                                  Boston Globe and look at the BBC look at                                  the Grammy website you know look at big                                  websites and small and see how they're                                  handling that change in hierarchy and                                  that change in in style and placement                                  and flow and and start to see what what                                  seems to work to you so we have to you                                  know think about the emerging trends in                                  you I so everybody knows when you're                                  looking at Twitter on your phone that                                  you pull down to refresh somebody                                  thought of that and it was just some                                  little little trick that one guy built                                  into one app and it has become I think                                  lightning fast one of one of the this                                  most strongly adopted conventions in the                                  mobile web so these things are coming                                  along the three little horizontal bars                                  for a menu it's another one that's                                  starting                                  so you have to follow those things and                                  start to build that library of ways of                                  thinking and doing that our app that are                                  relevant to the platform at hand native                                  apps really work people spend tons of                                  time using native apps and they do that                                  for a number of reasons some as                                  performance because they're fast and                                  some is because it can store data                                  sometimes it's just because it's a game                                  but there are certain things that are                                  true across all of them some of them are                                  more successful than others think about                                  the apps you love and then start to                                  deconstruct why do you love using this                                  app because it lets you get a job done                                  or because it's fun or is it a                                  combination does it make doing that job                                  fun that's important too so a lot of                                  those things are equally applicable when                                  you're doing stuff on the web one more                                  there we go so you have to think about                                  which ones apply best to your scenario                                  and then think about can they be applied                                  equally well in HTML as they can be in a                                  native app that just totally crapped out                                  on me um all right so this is a bit of a                                  rant of mine at times I think that if                                  you are a web designer you must know                                  HTML and CSS I don't think there is any                                  excuse I don't care I don't care if you                                  do it all the time but I think you have                                  to understand it everybody trots out the                                  architect doesn't know how to build a                                  house well actually that's not true they                                  know everything about building a house                                  and they know every capability of every                                  material that goes into making that                                  house because they have to you can't                                  build a house out of materials that                                  can't stay in the wait you can't build                                  things that can't withstand normal                                  weather patterns I mean an architect has                                  to take into consideration more                                  information than you would think                                  possible to design something that can be                                  built that is appropriate for the                                  environment in which it is placed so as                                  a designer if you don't understand how                                  jquery and HTML and CSS work you're not                                  really going to be able                                  leverage those things in your design                                  process and you will continue to design                                  pages and that's not really going to get                                  you all that far when you're trying to                                  think about behavior when you're trying                                  to support tasks these are things that                                  you have to know how that can be done in                                  order to design something that can                                  actually do it see if I can actually get                                  this to advance the slide again maybe                                  not so there we go um there are a lot of                                  ways to learn you can talk to Kay you                                  can subscribe to Drupal eyes me you can                                  buy any of the books they have for sale                                  in the book store downstairs you can go                                  to camps and cons there's so many ways                                  that you can learn all of this stuff                                  there's just no excuse to not stretch to                                  those adjacencies so you're designing a                                  website and you're maybe doing some of                                  the theme to bring that to life or at                                  least you're building some HTML and CSS                                  to support it and make a prototype why                                  not start to learn how to put that into                                  a theme you get to know one of the                                  starter themes it gives you a shortcut                                  to actually being able to bring the HTML                                  and CSS that you know into an                                  environment that can actually be used on                                  the site once you know that you then                                  need to be able to get stuff onto the                                  page so rather than just looking at a                                  Drupal installation you might want to                                  then learn a little bit about how the                                  views module works so that way you can                                  get the result set out onto the page to                                  which you can apply your design you know                                  there's are a lot of discrete little                                  things but I think too often we think                                  and very regimented in segmented ways I                                  am a designer I am a femur I am a                                  developer I am a site builder I am an                                  admin well most of us are all of those                                  things to a greater or lesser extent and                                  the sooner we accept that and figure out                                  that that can actually support these                                  other activities and inform them they                                  give us a direction so we think about                                  well I do a and B                                  and I could probably do a better if I                                  understood a little bit about see so if                                  I want to be able to design for all of                                  these widgets that are going to be on                                  the page and I know that you'll be                                  better if I actually understood how to                                  get the classes there that's something                                  that you really need to think about and                                  you can learn you can do these things so                                  there's a distribution there's an app                                  there's a module there's a something                                  that can support pretty much any                                  designer and allow them to get into this                                  whole world of not just working in                                  photoshop not just working even in                                  Photoshop and fireworks and whatever                                  else but actually coming across that                                  spectrum to really be able to understand                                  and follow through on that that whole                                  site it's not going to be one size fits                                  all it's not going to be just a                                  responsive theme because like I said                                  that's going to get you some mechanics                                  but it's not going to get you all the                                  way to supporting the behaviors in the                                  best way possible so that's where you                                  know I think bringing in something like                                  jquery mobile or jqtouch makes a lot of                                  sense on the very small end but I                                  wouldn't want to build a whole website                                  that way so I think there are very                                  controlled circumstances where that                                  makes a lot of sense bringing it in a                                  blended way so that you only pull it in                                  when for example touch is supported                                  doesn't make sense to bring it in when                                  it's not html                                                             is going to let you do that so these are                                  simple things out there that can help                                  support doing these tests and knowing                                  what you can present in various                                  circumstances the second that you decide                                  to learn these things you've started to                                  get better you've started to grow as a                                  designer and you've started to kind of                                  adapt so that you don't become the                                  dinosaur you don't become a print                                  designer for example and this is someone                                  who started as one so there's no excuse                                  for aerial nor is there an excuse for                                  that plug-in is not found or this                                  website best viewed in this particular                                  version and combination and you have to                                  spin around three times and throw some                                  salt over your shoulder                                  that should never happen that's what web                                  standards is about that's what                                  responsive design is about is making                                  sure that you've brought together                                  progressive enhancement all of these                                  things that make that website work I                                  don't care if it's in a linear flow in                                  ie                                                                        done as much as I don't like it I would                                  rather give them something that's                                  unadorned than something that's broken                                  so choose your cutoff point whatever it                                  is and go to Andy Clark's website and                                  get his basically you know eff off this                                  is your style sheet if you don't you                                  know if you're below this level and                                  they'll have something reasonable it'll                                  work and then you can focus your efforts                                  on the platforms where you get the                                  biggest bang for your buck really so                                  start download one of these themes if                                  you haven't already and start to play                                  start to understand how it works and how                                  you can configure it to do things that                                  you want to do and start looking                                  elsewhere around the web for the things                                  that have grown up in the web design                                  world that are creeping in like adaptive                                  images like Les and sass and compass                                  html                                                                    ways to start building your own theme or                                  modifying one that you're working with                                  all of those tools are going to help you                                  address the                                                            that you can cover with building a site                                  in one way so don't do this don't sit                                  there designing something static and                                  think that you know how that's going to                                  live in the wild because you don't um                                  prototyping and static HTML will only                                  get you so far and one of the things                                  that we changed at school yard was that                                  we took our starter theme in Zen and                                  that became our prototype engine so we                                  have the system already deployed for a                                  school and we have this base theme that                                  we put on there that's just kind of                                  black white and grey and that is and so                                  when we put to build content types and                                  start pulling this stuff out it's like a                                  living wireframe so we do one or two                                  page mock-ups and then we're directly                                  going in and working with real HTML real                                  CSS that will                                  become the site and it's also an amazing                                  reaction you get from the client when                                  they've been working in this sandbox                                  that's unfeigned to start getting their                                  content together and then all of a                                  sudden they log in the next day and like                                  ninety percent of the design is there                                  and the dish that's a WoW you've like                                  one so many points with them right in                                  that moment you have just like socked up                                  so much goodwill with them you could get                                  them to agree to anything after that I                                  mean this really it's it's the                                  psychology of handling the client to                                  it's really important um so you know the                                  reality that number that was one school                                  in three days it was already at that                                  point and climbing for the amount of                                  mobile access on that school's website                                  this stuff is not going away you can at                                  least in the u.s. I'm sure you can                                  elsewhere by a car that has pandora in                                  it that is just so weird so you know you                                  have a touch screen in a car that has a                                  really fast reaction time and an                                  internet connection and you can you know                                  pull up your apps of your email and                                  stuff on that why I don't know but you                                  can so again how's your design going to                                  hold up in a car touchscreen who knows                                  you have to go buy a Toyota to find out                                  there this is really out of date the                                  percentage of users that are that have a                                  smartphone is skyrocketing the                                  percentage of users on which they have                                  either a high-end Android device or one                                  of these is likewise skyrocketing that's                                  about fifty percent in the market share                                  for any kind of smartphone is one of                                  those two devices so it's a huge amount                                  of computing power a lot of capabilities                                  that's getting to the point where you                                  need to care a lot more about this than                                  I e                                                                      way bigger percentage than ie                                             the best argument in the world to go                                  back to the client say well you know we                                  could support this tiny percentage of                                  users with ie                                                            many that used one of these devices                                  where do you want to spend your budget I                                  mean if you want to draw a line                                  somewhere that's that's where to draw it                                  again like I mentioned the Kindle Fire                                  two hundred dollars for a really capable                                  beautifully put together two                                  ice I don't think it's the most polished                                  you I but it is the only screen I've                                  seen on a tablet that rivals the iPad                                  it's really crisp it's a nice screen TVs                                  as well like I said you can get facebook                                  in an app on your Samsung TV or you can                                  use the apple TV and just flick the                                  display from your laptop over to that                                  that's a huge difference it's a huge                                  resolution and and it's really going to                                  change the way people interact with your                                  site when they have such a big scale on                                  which to view it so that actually                                  couples really nicely with retina                                  displays so incredibly high resolution                                  but not necessarily the biggest device                                  or the the fastest pipe you can put a                                  super high resolution photo on a Retina                                  display phone but you've just used up                                  four times as much bandwidth when I'm on                                  edge who wants to browse on that so you                                  know you have to make a lot of decisions                                  about the technologies you use and when                                  you use them but that's the still it's                                  something that you've got to think about                                  it's possible it might not be smart so                                  figuring out what you don't know                                  figuring out how to adapt your design                                  process and figuring out how that how                                  you can use these things to make your                                  design more resilient to make your                                  meaning carry through and get the intent                                  of the design to work no matter where                                  people view it that is why you have a                                  few off files to edit and and your                                  responsive design kind of takes care of                                  the rest or whatever strategy it is                                  you're following and and that's the                                  thing that will help guard against not                                  knowing what's next I don't care how                                  many smartphones come out because I know                                  I can design for something that fits in                                  this range of resolution and I know that                                  they all have the capabilities of a                                  modern safari or opera or Android based                                  browser as long as you'll want a                                  background image to stay in the same                                  place on Android anybody else have fun                                  with that background images will never                                  stay fixed they're not well anyway they                                  will they just don't know um there's a                                  huge number of modules we don't know                                  what people are going to make next                                  there's probably another thousand of                                  them after this week                                  a lot of times except adapt your                                  thinking adapt your basic tool set when                                  you're designing it's not that much                                  extra effort but it is a huge payoff to                                  be able to go to the client and say no                                  it's not an option it's not an add-on to                                  make your site responsive it's just the                                  right way to do it and this is your                                  budget and after you've done it a couple                                  of times you'll see that that budget                                  doesn't have to be that different                                  whether or not you want it to be as                                  another question entirely I think it has                                  greater value but the work required is                                  not necessarily that much more than just                                  doing a solid single resolution website                                  um you know and then I haven't even                                  talked about Drupal as the hub for the                                  content for other things you might have                                  a website that has content that might be                                  responsive but it might also drive                                  content to a nap or a number of apps or                                  a number of subscription feeds for                                  things that go to other websites or even                                  other Drupal websites you don't know but                                  again that that Drupal glue in the                                  middle and that responsive thinking on                                  your part helps keep your markup and                                  your content pure so that the content                                  comes out of the system marked up                                  correctly so that it can be                                  intelligently represented wherever it                                  lands I think that's really important so                                  if it's being subscribed to elsewhere                                  those tags have to go with it when it's                                  on your site those tags are what drives                                  that meaning that can then be translated                                  or moved around based on different                                  factors and different screen resolutions                                  so where do you fit well you know design                                  well if you're a designer and I'm out of                                  time so let's let like one slide um you                                  are the person that knows this the best                                  you should know your client and you                                  should know the web you're ideally                                  situated in the middle there to think                                  about these things and make them part of                                  your design process and then you get to                                  use Drupal to help you help you build it                                  so got your tools you've got your things                                  to your topics to think about and stuff                                  to learn buddy up stretch learn some new                                  skills and then just go out and do stuff                                  I lied it was two more slides I'm sorry                                  so this is just kind of wrap up and                                  review um all of these things are the                                  reasons why you've got to think about                                  this stuff and then you just want to get

this copy                                  of the slides on the site and it has two                                  extra screens at the end with resources                                  for books
