Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Building for the editor experience
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	The editor experience is somehow a blind spot in a lot of projects.
For most websites a lot of efforts go into building a good user experience for site visitors and we also put a lot of work in functionality, but very often we are missing out on usability for editors.
There are a lot of sites that are used extensively by editors and for them the "frontend" is the "backend". The out of the box functionality just isn't enough, to make them love to work with Drupal for content management.
In this session I want to show, what modules and techniques you can use right now to build a way better editor friendly interface.
This is a modified version of the session I held during FrontendUnited Conference (http://frontendunited.org) and DevDaysBarcelona.
The focus for this session will be more on sitebuilding, strategy for information architecture, building editor friendly forms and an overall interface that focuses on an editor's needs.

Topics:
Common pain points in content management
Modules you can use to build an editor friendly backend
Strategies for the "intuitive" interface
Customizing the content admin interface with the editors in mind
