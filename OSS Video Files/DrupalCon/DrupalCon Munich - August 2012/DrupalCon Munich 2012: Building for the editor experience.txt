Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Building for the editor experience
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	The editor experience is somehow a blind spot in a lot of projects.
For most websites a lot of efforts go into building a good user experience for site visitors and we also put a lot of work in functionality, but very often we are missing out on usability for editors.
There are a lot of sites that are used extensively by editors and for them the "frontend" is the "backend". The out of the box functionality just isn't enough, to make them love to work with Drupal for content management.
In this session I want to show, what modules and techniques you can use right now to build a way better editor friendly interface.
This is a modified version of the session I held during FrontendUnited Conference (http://frontendunited.org) and DevDaysBarcelona.
The focus for this session will be more on sitebuilding, strategy for information architecture, building editor friendly forms and an overall interface that focuses on an editor's needs.

Topics:
Common pain points in content management
Modules you can use to build an editor friendly backend
Strategies for the "intuitive" interface
Customizing the content admin interface with the editors in mind

building                               for the editor experience my name is                               andreas Allah I've worked with Wonder                               crowd here in Germany and yeah I'm                               really happy that so many of you are                               here for attending my session and I'm                               really up on top of that I'm really                                really thrilled that we have so many                                sessions talking about user experience                                for the different people like like                                developers and site builders and most of                                all editors and having the talks about                                the spark initiative and all that things                                and also like the session we had before                                anybody attended the session that was in                                this room right before this one here                                yeah because it's really nice it's like                                it's like having back to back the the                                the the session before what's about                                designing for the everyday things it was                                more about concepts of design what can                                what can go right one kit what can go                                wrong about concepts there so I think                                this could be a really nice addition to                                that because this goes into Drupal and I                                want to have a look with you at the                                things we are doing right now what we                                can improve on the editor experience in                                in all kinds of areas there are so many                                things to talk about in this topic that                                the session I held this session before                                in Barcelona during the Deaf days and I                                also have this at the front end United                                because this is a topic that concerns a                                lot of people working and in different                                areas with drupal and but it's there's                                quite a few things we we could cover and                                talk about and so I will try to do my                                best and give a good overview but i                                encourage you to just step in ask                                questions while we're doing this because                                I think there's so many things that I                                will run out of time anyways so and I                                don't want to get in the situation where                                we                                don't have time to ask questions in the                                end so feel free to come in it's a topic                                that concerns us all from different                                experiences that we have with our                                clients and with our projects so just                                raise your hands ask questions when you                                feel that there's something that                                interests you and we can talk about this                                oh that's the first one yeah sure so is                                this better yes great wonderful so um as                                I said building for the editor                                experience so let's let's see where                                we're at first of all we we have to see                                who is an editor you know because                                there's a little whole lot different                                people working with Drupal and so let's                                look at the roles that we have in real                                life not these roles for permissions                                that we might end up with configuration                                in Drupal but what our roles in real                                life there's content authors they're                                creating content there's editors that                                are have to deal with it was has been                                created or create content on their own                                there's people coming in translating                                there's maybe people in bigger projects                                that are just dealing with assets like                                pictures or videos and all that stuff so                                we need to focus on what they want to                                achieve when they work with Drupal when                                they try to deal with the content it's a                                content management system and there's                                people really having different tasks                                they want to achieve and they don't want                                to be bothered with all of them with all                                the interface that we have there so this                                is one of the challenges that we are                                facing so let's see there's these                                different roles there's these different                                people and you have to when you when you                                do an interface for four different                                people that do different things and                                behave different and also for maybe                                different clients and their their topics                                you have to try to picture them who they                                are and what they're going to do and and                                and this is a good basis to find out how                                their interface and their workflows in                                terms of creating content                                managing content finding translating and                                all that things have to work for them so                                first of all yeah we should set up these                                 roles we should have configure for them                                 but this is this is just a teeny tiny                                 step on the way we should start start                                 from the beginning and test we test on                                 our user stories we have to we go in                                 there picture what somebody has to do                                 not only in the front end not only by                                 leaving a comment or using the the                                 gallery pictures or something like that                                 but also for the back end where where                                 somebody starts his work with a blank                                 page or with a new menu item and another                                 person comes in and tries to con                                 configure something or place some blocks                                 there so we should really start test                                 early and picture the personas here and                                 as far as the permission system goes                                 it's not a replacement for a good                                 interface strategy we have to do a lot                                 of configuration there that we can work                                 with the permissions that the people                                 only see what they have to deal with or                                 only are allowed to what to work with                                 the stuff that really has to concern                                 them but you you can just rely on                                 configure and permissions and everything                                 is done because there will be a lot of                                 areas where people would be allowed to                                 do something but it's not good for them                                 to have so many options so let's look at                                 that so for really finding out what we                                 can do for the for the editors we have                                 to picture what what does an editor                                 really want and you know the first thing                                 that comes to mind is he wants to create                                 pages the people think in my website my                                 I want to have a page here I want to                                 have a new content there and I want to                                 have a new menu item and maybe I want to                                 find and select content or link content                                 but this is sean already an advanced                                 topic or i wanted to translate the text                                 and all these things like that so but                                 what do they really think when they                                 approach the task of creating and                                 dealing with content they think in pages                                 how shall a page look like what opens I                                 want to place there how is this how can                                 a user in the front and find the page                                 and where do I where they do i place my                                 contents there so here's a screenshot                                 that's created what they created along                                 not a long time ago about a while ago                                 that was the discussion of the usability                                 group that led to in this direction what                                 we have now the layouts and blocks                                 initiative that would they did an                                 analysis of or did try to picture of how                                 a normal person things normally there's                                 in this there's a link for that you can                                 read up on that there's two screenshots                                 the other one shows how we think how we                                 think in terms of here's a note here's a                                 block here's a pain here's some                                 navigation this is a footer area but um                                 you know an editor he looks at the page                                 and forever everything is content for                                 him it doesn't matter for him it that                                 this is a slideshow or this is some                                 views output everything is this content                                 and so he wants to approach this for                                 like I want to edit this so everything                                 is content I want to go here at a                                 picture I want to translate this text                                 this I have right here in front of me                                 and maybe I want to add another item to                                 this list so how can I do this and we                                 have to think and plan for that and                                 build our sites that these tasks can be                                 completed and another thing is we we                                 always have this mixture of maybe I call                                 them automatic versus manual pages                                 there's people coming in like for a                                 newspaper thing where they say okay I                                 have this place I think many of you guys                                 that are Germans and know these project                                 was                                 type of free there's a lot of thinking                                 in this area we have a we have a tree of                                 our offer of our menu and then we want                                 to place some contents there and this is                                 something that is really similar to the                                 people are thinking placing doing manual                                 pages but on the other hand we have                                 these great tool box with Drupal where                                 we can have views and lists and and all                                 different blocks queering a content from                                 the database and presenting it and this                                 is this is more of an automatic approach                                 but it's never you know separated you                                 never have a project where everything it                                 gets output by views and you never have                                 a project where every page is you know                                 created arbitrary so yeah                                 so the question was if I have a solution                                 for inline editing of all that kinds of                                 stuff no I haven't but there's a really                                 good approaches and there's also really                                 good things you can do in this area                                 because the things start with the little                                 things if you have a list of news items                                 with a view you could just provide with                                 the contextual links that are                                 configurable by by a programmer or you                                 could provide a button in the header to                                 add a new content of this type that is                                 gets listed by this view and this is one                                 step in the way to just having in this                                 page that I'm looking at to add                                 something or you could like I said                                 before enhance these contextual links to                                 get more out of that and obviously                                 there's a panels and panel Iser and the                                 in-place editor which which really helps                                 in dealing with these pages most of them                                 tending to be more manually arbitrary                                 created together but still also for                                 these automatic things you can deal with                                 this okay so but most of the time you                                 have a mixture so we have to plan for                                 that that there will be somebody sitting                                 there and saying okay I want to change                                 this I want to reorder the the views                                 output that i have here I want to add                                 something so we need to find solutions                                 there so                                 also what comes up is there an editing                                 mode this is somehow drawing the line                                 before between maybe in place editing                                 editing from starting from the front end                                 and going in in the back and listing                                 contents finding content there editing                                 and hoping that everything gets put out                                 correctly or new adding new products and                                 in the repository where all the products                                 live where which you can find at the                                 content listing so we have to picture                                 for each project and and the users we                                 know that we have to deal with this how                                 they cross the line between back-end and                                 front-end is other is there really a                                 situation where we where everybody can                                 just work in the front end in line edit                                 I think you know when we look at this                                 spark initiative it will help a great                                 deal with these with these situations                                 where somebody looks at a patient says I                                 want to I want to edit this but we have                                 we have to also think about all these                                 other things where we have to find the                                 content and you know provide an                                 interface for the for all types of                                 editors so let's have just a look at the                                 at the at the thing that we are dealing                                 with with Drupal there's points where                                 drupal makes our life harder we have                                 that these situations where the                                 chronological order in in the workflow                                 that an editor has to take is maybe                                 feels a little reverse for a lot of                                 editors we have not we have no no                                 distinct or not you know unique system                                 for structuring content we can do so                                 many things we can have taxonomy menus                                 we can have regular menus where I create                                 manual manual menu items we can have                                 views collect stuff we can order this by                                 my date so this this is a thing where we                                 have many of these different approaches                                 we have to do deal with that because our                                 editors have to understand that and                                 sometimes we have a little bit much of                                 an interface because there's so many                                 configuration options and things you can                                 change an altar which is really great                                 but we have to deal with that for                                 somebody who is not that savvy that we                                 are and the configuration options are                                 all over the place place so if we look                                 at the admin menu when we have a full                                 site install of a really site loaded                                 with functionality this is not good for                                 an editor and the more functionality we                                 add it that leads to loss of consistency                                 as I mentioned before you have maybe the                                 standard menu and you have a menu block                                 and you have taxonomy menu and you have                                 drupal blocks and views blocks and views                                 content pains and note blocks and mini                                 panels and all they have a little bit                                 different interfaces and all of them are                                 not really understandable from the first                                 point of seeing them for somebody who is                                 not a techie but on the other hand what                                 what where is the points where drupal                                 makes our life easier we have a                                 framework we have a great architecture                                 and we have all these possibilities for                                 the for the developers using hooks to                                 alter the stuff that's there and there's                                 a lot of modules that help us in making                                 a better interface and we have a big                                 community that that we see right now                                 that is really concerned with these                                 topics and tries to work with them in                                 all these different approaches so what                                 do you hear a lot is that an interface                                 should be simple and intuitive that's as                                 easy to say but we have to you know                                 implement that so what we what we would                                 might be there is something fast                                 efficient and what we should do is avoid                                 confusion and have less as less on                                 assess unnecessary UI as we can do so                                 that nobody is sitting there and really                                 trying for help we have to deal with                                 that so but do we do that by providing                                 help there's a lot of projects where                                 people go in for                                 right huge amounts of documentation I                                 have screenshots annotated with with                                 arrows and little remarks or do                                 screencasts with with which is all is                                 helpful but maybe as we heard before in                                 the session things should be in the                                 first place as simple as they can be and                                 then you don't have so much work for                                 explaining them so do it does anybody                                 need help I think sometimes less help is                                 more and we should approach the things                                 like you know guide the people through                                 the tasks they have to do and we have to                                 do this visually and by structure and I                                 say don't think maybe about health text                                 think more action button so if we look                                 at a help interface in Drupal this is                                 really I looked for the worst-case                                 scenario yeah this is a advanced help                                 installed and you know there's a lot of                                 text if you have time and you're                                 interested you can read this and it will                                 be helpful because somebody that put it                                 together has really good information for                                 that but it's normally you need help on                                 the spot or you have to understand                                 something on the spot so let's look at                                 something this is the interface for the                                 main menu creating menu links so if we                                 look at that screen what is the most                                 important action it's really hard to                                 tell you know there's main menu there's                                 so save what I'm am i saving here and                                 there's test page ok I can click Edit                                 description and there's this thing add                                 link so it's it's often we and we when                                 we look at the our Drupal interface it's                                 not easy to find out what we what we                                 have to do next or if we look at it                                 something else like this is the page                                 manager of panels or where the interface                                 gets more and more complicated and                                 people really have a hard time to find                                 their way around I think I know this is                                 a really hard example because you never                                 would go there and try to root an editor                                 people do this but you'll drew tan                                 editor on this page and say hey you have                                 to configure or create something here                                 this is really a worst-case scenario but                                 I think you get the part you get the                                 point there so what can we do you know                                 we need we need to focus on the things                                 and really provide a visual guidance for                                 the people what they have to do next and                                 this is a small example I took here from                                 this Dollar Shave Club Website we see                                 where it's really obvious what you would                                 do next you just do it and that guides                                 somebody to something you don't need a                                 help text here you maybe have these                                 screens here that they explain a little                                 bit but hey the next thing maybe apart                                 from watching the video will be do it so                                 that leads to the topic guiding performs                                 so about the structure of forms and                                 visually guiding the editors if they                                 have if it can provide a system where                                 the people know what is what they have                                 to do next this will help them greatly                                 to deal with creating content so this is                                 an example of a form for a recipe this                                 is a quote was a project we did for a                                 cooking community the German people will                                 be able to read this better but this is                                 a forum for a recipe and as you see here                                 there's help when you need it there's                                 little tool tips where you can find the                                 help if if you really get lost in the                                 stage of editing there you are but it                                 doesn't obstruct your your view from all                                 the rest of the form this is one thing                                 or like here on as you can see here a                                 little bit on the bottom it tells you                                 how many how many characters you can put                                 in this field or on the on the other                                 side there's something for uploading the                                 recipe pictures and you see instantly                                 the first picture is a little bit bigger                                 that will be the promoted picture of the                                 recipe that's really easy to understand                                 for an editor this is just the small                                 things you can do here and you see it                                 start                                 with with a point                                                     two and so you have for your people                                 working with that you have a structure                                 where they know okay I have to complete                                 my tasks somehow yeah this will be                                 information about the recipes you see                                 these groups of things they have to fill                                 in here this is all structured a little                                 bit so that they know okay how can we go                                 the through this step-by-step and                                 finally you see this is the eighth step                                 so there has been a lot more in between                                 but by separating this and guiding the                                 people it makes it a little bit easier                                 and even if you have to deal with these                                 complex things you know and an interface                                 cannot be less complex than the task you                                 have to complete but on the other hand                                 it mustn't be much harder than this                                 thing you are trying to do so if you                                 have to collect collect many information                                 and the people obviously have to do this                                 but they don't have to you know be in                                 pain while doing this but it says                                 finally but are really finally there I                                 mean not quite because there's some                                 questions that we carry around for some                                 years in Drupal one is this encircled                                 red thing here the preview button it's                                 German it says for shell but that means                                 in english means preview and obviously                                 that shouldn't be there because it never                                 worked yeah so this is the thing we have                                 to address this is also another thing we                                 might be addressing with like just save                                 it and go back and in line edit the rest                                 of the stuff that when you see your page                                 and start working there or you have to                                 implement something really intelligently                                 to really have a preview but right now                                 we're really struggling yes                                 and in this example it doesn't work                                 because you your question was if the                                 preview in this example didn't work or                                 in Drupal in general in this example it                                 doesn't work because it doesn't work in                                 Drupal in general because you get a                                 beaut you know you get a preview yeah                                 but you get the preview as soon as you                                 use an admin theme you get the preview                                 in the admin theme and so you never get                                 a real preview on your content if you if                                 you ever used the the Drupal interface                                 there you can see how the content is                                 structured you can see the filtering                                 maybe you know because but who                                 understands filtering you know as an                                 editor but this is a hold on hold                                 another point but you would like to see                                 the preview of how it looks on the page                                 and there's so many other things coming                                 in with that like other blocks and other                                 stuff and there's this other thing that                                 really makes things really different                                 what and all of that yes you're correct                                 and he said and an additional added form                                 yes and and also the question arises we                                 had some talks with some colleagues here                                 and why why don't we save right away                                 this is not a question I can answer here                                 either yeah but this is because this is                                 a really a Drupal internal but this is                                 also a thing we we should think about                                 you know if you use Google Docs you open                                 up a new document and it gets instantly                                 saved with untitled document and you can                                 later go and change this obviously we                                 have a lot of things we're dealing with                                 here because we have required fields and                                 all of that but that would be a nice                                 thing to have in the future just hey                                 save don't let the users worry about                                 that clearly there's a lot of things to                                 to deal with there because you have like                                 workflows and everything but yeah it                                 would be nice things                                 this case you can say save as a draft                                 but if it's already public and then you                                 edit something and you mess it up and                                 then you say yeah yeah yeah that's you                                 you mentioned the problem you know that                                 we might have a workflow and and                                 different versions of all that stuff                                 this is a whole different area again and                                 I strongly encourage that we talk a                                 little bit later I think because we                                 could talk another two hours about that                                 also but you're perfectly correct                                 versioning and dealing with that stuff                                 is also really hard for it because it's                                 also a really abstract concept for the                                 for the editors you know they don't want                                 to care about this so let's go on a                                 little bit optimizing node forms we have                                 seen a little bit about structuring long                                 forms but also we have this separation                                 there's might they might be advanced                                 options or attributes or metadata like                                 like having the the page title or the                                 menu item or the description of the meta                                 tags or something we put there for                                 separating this product product from                                 another product and all of that kind of                                 stuff and there's one really important                                 thing which has a star here semantic                                 content types this is also a good                                 approach for making the content editors                                 life a lot lot easier we have a lot of                                 these content types where we recreate                                 that have a purpose so there's it's a                                 it's a product or it's a news item or                                 it's a gallery or it's an image or it's                                 in video a video and we have have to                                 really take care about that this is as                                 semantic as it can come so that an                                 editor instantly knows I'm creating this                                 and that will have this output it's not                                 always easy with these things we have                                 these arbitrary pages where you have                                 maybe a layout and you would put                                 something there or you have this basic                                 page but it's always good to think where                                 are opportunities to give the the editor                                 a semantic context or do to build them a                                 content type that is semantically in in                                 this area how is thinking or how his                                 company thinks so that will also help                                 him really to achieve the desired                                 results much faster reduce abstraction                                 not not go in there and have an article                                 with like                                                               know a news article or a blog article or                                 another thing it always comes down to                                 seeing what you have in the in your                                 concept for your client but this also                                 really helps a great deal because people                                 understand these things that are created                                 like in their everyday in their business                                 life a lot better so how to deal with                                 long forms we have been we have been                                 seen a lot of stuff and what is about                                 configuration and content you have to                                 think about what the your interface is                                 used for we hear this screenshot is is                                 the configuration of the mother                                 mothership theme that Martin did for                                 this type of input this might be perfect                                 because you have so many you have you go                                 in there and you have a choice of things                                 you want to get a good overview of what                                 you want to configure butt for a if you                                 if you look at this interface with                                 multiple accordions or collapsible                                 containers that wouldn't work for                                 something where it's content where you                                 want to see everything you have to put                                 in there so for four you have to also                                 think what are you doing there is this                                 as a piece of content is this something                                 you have to fill out completely or where                                 you have to see all the options or is                                 this something where go in find                                 something what you want to change and                                 you d collapse the the container and go                                 in there edit this safe and come back                                 later at any time and find another                                 option you might change and this is also                                 a thing where you have to really think                                 about that not obstructing the flow that                                 the people are having or providing                                 something that this gets and gives you a                                 good overview so if I talked about                                 separating content from attributes or                                 mated a dram what I'm doing a lot of                                 times is I'm building a simple concept                                 where I have like two columns like it                                 like you see our inmost in a lot of                                 front ends we're going in and separate                                 on the light hand left hand side you                                 have all the data that might get out put                                 on your page so the editors know okay                                 this is my area where I have all these                                 information that leads to the content                                 that gets put out on the side and on the                                 right hand side there's more like the                                 metadata like like here it's a product                                 you can choose in which sector this                                 product has to be placed like it's a                                 publishing digital business this was for                                 a publishing house or what type is it                                 this is more a product or more or                                 service so you could argue like I said                                 before maybe you should separate this                                 because this for your edit ER is is more                                 simple to have the product and the                                 service that really depends on the use                                 case you're having there but here you                                 have at least you have a separation                                 between the metadata or the attributes                                 and the main data and so that will help                                 also the user to separate this you can                                 easily achieve this just by using the                                 field crews module and putting in like                                 to open divs give them a class and now                                 we have two columns you don't need to                                 worry about a lot of things you have to                                 do there and you can replicate this for                                 your audio product I think there was a                                 question there from behind ok great so                                 and when you look at that you also have                                 to think about it what is important I                                 have the screenshot here that was a just                                 a work in progress there and you see                                 obviously there's somebody came in and                                 said ok that this is obviously it's                                 important to set the language correctly                                 even the label got got a                                 more important color and so but you know                                 this is this might be good but you sort                                 you should sort the things correctly if                                 this language switch is so important put                                 it on the top you know make it the                                 editor is easier to deal with this or                                 hear the up on top it says this is a                                 media content type so the image which is                                 obviously the most important part for                                 this media thingy here should also be on                                 top why should the date come first which                                 is maybe the second or third important                                 thing we're editing here so structuring                                 that correctly also helps the editor is                                 a great deal of completing the form in a                                 timely fashion so here i put in a                                 screenshot where similar concept is what                                 we have right now which is planned for                                 for drupal                                                             site they they put up for showing this                                 new content edit form for a job late and                                 also they have a separation what we had                                 in the world with tabs before on the                                 bottom where which was really great                                 because it it compressed the form a                                 little but on the other hand you found                                 out that people really were clicking                                 through all of them to find out what                                 they have to do there and it was from                                 the placement here not not as perfect as                                 it could be so they moved it also to                                 your sidebar here and I think this is a                                 great thing because it doesn't obstruct                                 the view on on the content you're                                 creating here but also provides an a                                 good intent attention to the things you                                 also have to deal with like if the                                 content gets published or promoted and                                 all that stuff so yeah there's a                                 question                                 I think this is a good combination that                                 the question was if the if this human                                 collapse of sidebar in that the whole                                 sidebar is collapsing or that you have                                 these collapsible elements in the                                 sidebar yeah so like it's shown here                                 yeah i think it's it's it's a good                                 compromise you know because when you                                 have you get a great deal of attention                                 because it's placed at the right top                                 area where you really see the things but                                 also it you don't you don't have to see                                 everything you just know you know when                                 you label the things correctly you just                                 know when you have to click menu                                 settings and you just know when you when                                 you want to go in and deal with common                                 settings or the offering information so                                 i think this is a good compromise i                                 think some of the modules we'll have to                                 see how they can deal with this confined                                 space they are having and obviously it                                 needs a solution for a mobile but i                                 think it's a good start so if you can                                 and you can read up more on the history                                 there's the links there and i think                                 there should be a session on that too or                                 has been I don't know so coming back to                                 our interface problems it's really easy                                 to get confused by an interface with too                                 many controls look at this this is a                                 this is a configuration screen for a                                 custom panel page and there's so many                                 things there's so many tabs and buttons                                 and and and vertical tabs and text and                                 everything this this is even hard for                                 for a season drupal developer when it                                 when it gets there the first time                                 because there's so many things to do and                                 it's not really clear what you do there                                 so you need really time to work on this                                 but can't this be easier that's our                                 interfaces you know have to have to have                                 everything in there or can we stream                                 like this the line this down I don't                                 know if this picture he is the best                                 solution you know just having on and off                                 but                                 should always when we do these things                                 and build the sides together have a look                                 at what we can do there to improve and                                 to move the things away that you don't                                 need to deal with in your role like I                                 stated before because you having a role                                 that you don't want to configure all if                                 you're an editor you want to get your                                 job done so let's look at the same                                 interface with almost the same options                                 this is the in-place editor for the same                                 page this is much much more clearer you                                 have also your layout options you have                                 your columns you have your your way of                                 adding something new and you have just a                                 few buttons you can always go in there                                 and say hey we could lose a few of them                                 still but it's much much cleaner no you                                 could argue why why do you have a button                                 for four with the wheels for the                                 settings and next to that you have a                                 button for the for the panel styles why                                 don't you edit this in one area but                                 there's always the case that you arguing                                 on these things but if you look at this                                 this is much much more clean and much                                 more from comprehensive and also you                                 know looking at at the needs of an                                 editor you obviously have to provide him                                 an interface that that has only the the                                 options that he really needs so this is                                 an example for an extra menu but you can                                 also achieve this by doing you a good                                 configuration of of all the menu XS you                                 have for your editor because they want                                 to have maybe an overview of what they                                 have to do of what they have for content                                 they want to have a not area where they                                 can find their content they want to deal                                 with the structure that might even even                                 the case there's that there's a role                                 that doesn't deal with the structure and                                 you have another role that that will do                                 that for that for them so you can even                                 reduce this maybe more and this will be                                 somebody who deals with translation but                                 hey the site configuration is something                                 that might not be the thing what then                                 what an edge reduce does there so give                                 them a separate menu or try to                                 enhanced us that that may be the admin                                 menu that they're using gets reduced to                                 a same amount of many items that people                                 can use there and maybe if you get some                                 space back like it's a little bit bigger                                 the people can click on that a lot                                 easier and you know what I also think                                 would be a good approach is to provide                                 an area if you if you if you live in the                                 back end as an editor and try to find                                 your content provide them with an area                                 where they can find the things they have                                 to deal with that might be something                                 different that another an asset manager                                 has to deal with and think about what                                 will they do will they have to find the                                 content will they have to configure add                                 new items for the taxonomy place the                                 things there and this is an example of                                 the the workbench med module that is                                 really known for his workbench                                 moderation which is also a great thing                                 but also they bring a little dashboard                                 area here which is highly configurable                                 you can place a lot of different views                                 there and a lot of different stuff this                                 there's some other modules that do                                 something similar there's also linked                                 here for the the context admin menu that                                 provides you with a possibility to have                                 custom admin pages you know for just                                 people that have to just deal with with                                 one backup vocabulary or two vocabulary                                 of the                                                              provide them their own admin pages and                                 just deal with them and not be dealing                                 with other stuff they don't need to do                                 with ya                                 let me see at the time ok so what also                                 is really important is since we are                                 putting in most of the time they're                                 putting in content we have this great                                 system of the field you I providing them                                 with wheels but we have to find the                                 right widgets that they can complete                                 their task in a in a way that they don't                                 get really distracted of their task so                                 finding the right widget and I also                                 called it the Select box from hell                                 because this is one of the interface                                 elements where everybody knows that we                                 have we have problem that's not a Drupal                                 related problem and and we will see that                                 Drupal has a lot of modules that solve                                 the problem really good but we have to                                 think what are the people wanting to how                                 how do the people want to use their                                 select box so um as we all know the                                 problems with the Select box is                                 selecting multiple items or you know                                 finding everything in one view so here's                                 some modules that deal with this in a                                 nice way there's the multi-select module                                 that provides these two panes where you                                 can move the things around which is a                                 great concept for you know seeing what                                 is selected or not or this there's this                                 chosen module that gives you like a                                 combination of select list and and you                                 see that selected items on top there and                                 there's this module select or other that                                 provides provides another good thing                                 where you can say okay I can select                                 between these predefined options but I                                 also have the possibility to put some in                                 something new that greatly helps the                                 editors to because they have some                                 guidance what they can use and they can                                 also bring in their own things or this                                 thing here multiple selects may have a                                 way of selecting and ordering in a good                                 combination because you can select the                                 stuff and you also can put this in an                                 order and you know one of the things we                                 have to deal with a lot of times authors                                 have to set                                 date when they author the content                                 because sometimes we have these things                                 that get sorted by date and you have to                                 change that in some way to rearrange                                 that this is the most simple basic idea                                 of something in an interview for sorting                                 but you have to type in a date maybe in                                 in some obscure format so why don't have                                 we why don't do we have a pop up here so                                 there's a module for that it helps you                                 to have this little date pop up for your                                 author date you obviously could go in                                 and and activate some html                                           which would also be a good idea I think                                 and another thing you have to prevent                                 the validation failure people are                                 putting stuff in there you could put the                                 text there but we talked about help you                                 could say hey you can at thursday's you                                 can have                                                                 you're doing this and that but you just                                 could also count the characters and tell                                 the people hey you have three characters                                 left you don't have to cut them count                                 them on their own there's a module for                                 that and it really helps a great deal                                 because you don't save the form wait for                                 PHP and and and your apache server to                                 get you get back with the information                                 that you have to put in you you put into                                 three characters too much so this is a                                 this is also a great topic or a big                                 topic validation errors so from an                                 editor perspective I want to see my                                 errors fast and you know I want to I                                 want to know where this error occurred                                 that you know unfortunately happened so                                 when when we look at Drupal right now                                 out of the box we we provide with these                                 with these error in this message area                                 which is which is okay but as soon as                                 the the forms get longer or errors occur                                 in other forms like the yeah in other                                 forms like that the the note form where                                 you connect this this message area with                                 because it's always on the same page on                                 the top                                 you never know where you really have to                                 look and find and correct your error so                                 this is the thing that really that                                 really blocks editors in their way of                                 working with that and also this is about                                 client validate client-side validation                                 why should we wait for the for the                                 reload of the page to see which errors                                 we did so there's a module client-side                                 validation that does its job there it it                                 it provides us the same validation                                 things that the PHP is providing and                                 also you can put in HTML elements there                                 to help the people prevent these errors                                 they might occur because they have an                                 element that is more more usable                                 intuitively and as I said you need to                                 see the error messages right where they                                 occur if you have an error in a comment                                 form it's not it's not good to have the                                 error in the message area on top of the                                 page because hey the the air curd in                                 your comment and not anywhere else and                                 they're your page doesn't have to be                                 scrolling away from the from the place                                 where we have been editing like a minute                                 or a second before so there's this a                                 project called inline messages that puts                                 the messages in line to the to the                                 forums where they occurred and there's a                                 similar project called in line for error                                 errors which is ify yeah you could look                                 at it maybe that helps your editors to                                 work with these problematic situations                                 but also where it gets complicated where                                 we have these abstracts situations                                 because filling out a form to get a                                 content that gets placed on a page is                                 you know can kind can be kind of                                 abstract but as soon as it comes to                                 finding selecting and linking content                                 like linking an image to an to a content                                 or linking a user trissy to to some                                 content this it gets quite abstract and                                 it's a lot that the editors have to deal                                 with so we should make at least the task                                 to do that after they know they have to                                 achieve this a little bit easier so in a                                 lot of situations we have these                                 autocompletes which is great at up to                                 some point but not always the best                                 solution so if we look at that screen                                 here there's an autocomplete for                                    notes that you can place into a panel                                 and you know you can you can you can                                 start typing and you get titles back but                                 what what do you do if there's                                    identic titles there's two contents with                                 the same title okay you have a little                                 bit of meta data because it's this was                                 the test page was created by admin but                                 if you don't have so many users you                                 could run into problems there or these                                 are results that you getting there are                                 really limited to a certain amount i                                 think it's                                                              more results then you can you know find                                 by typing in your also lost so you need                                 something that helps you there a little                                 bit better so why not have an auto                                 complete with metadata there's this link                                 it module that provides a separation                                 what content types you're dealing with                                 you configure you can configure of to                                 show the authors to show the created                                 date that helps that helps a lot of on                                 finding and completing this task but you                                 can do even more why not you know this                                 is this is this is an enhancement of of                                  the node relation and user                                  relationship field often you have you                                  have an autocomplete there you have to                                  put in a title and you have to link to a                                  user by its user name you have to link                                  to it to an content by its content title                                  but often I said it before when I when I                                  started this talk often the                                  chronological order for the editors it                                  feels reversed because they have to be                                  have created the content that they are                                  linking to before they can link to it so                                  in this situation it's really nice to                                  have like this here like the node                                  connect and the node wrap these                                  references dialogue module they provide                                  these buttons to say hey I want to add                                  this what is in there or I want to                                  create something new in this area we                                  need to link news so I can create a new                                  news item so I can rise go in there                                  start creating something new and get                                  instantly back to my forum and have the                                  link to that so that feels a lot more                                  natural to an editor and the two modules                                  they are different in and how they do is                                  one does it with a with a modal window                                  and the other one forwards you to blue                                  form and gets you back to the old form                                  this is I think depends on the situation                                  you want to use this but from the                                  concept from the concept aspect this is                                  really an enhancement and another step                                  further would be you know having a view                                  to choose your content like creating                                  custom view that suits your site the                                  needs that the different content types                                  you have there may be some attributes                                  and everything you can use with a views                                  interface here to sled select your                                  content that was a proof of concept that                                  we did their sandbox module where we                                  work for a client and we just went in                                  there and put in a view there with a                                  little bit java script that would God                                  rendered into inside the form for                                  selecting the content there no this is                                  this is just this is just a similar area                                  we where you might think about that the                                  reference dialogue has                                  has this feature of yes yeah yeah you're                                  right you're right so what what what the                                  guy here was saying is with with the                                  references dialogue module you can use a                                  similar thing that you can have a view                                  therefore for selecting your content                                  which is really a great thing because                                  there you can really configure this that                                  it fits to the site you're building                                  there and fit to the editors in this                                  situation they have to link to the                                  content so and also here we have a                                  screenshot of of something where you                                  where you on a panelist page and you use                                  the panels the deciduous content plugins                                  why you want to place an existing                                  content this was also a thing we did for                                  a client we we went in there hey maybe                                  you just don't want to just link to an                                  existing content that's already there                                  maybe you want to create a new panel                                  pain with a new content that hasn't been                                  there at this moment because the editor                                  he works on his page and he decides I                                  want to have something new there so we                                  built on top of that and put in some                                  links which also use the same model for                                  creating a new layout or new gallery or                                  new media item whatever we had their of                                  content types and so you can have a                                  workflow that leads from being on the                                  page putting it wanting to put a panel                                  pain there with a Content that it's not                                  created do this finish the task and have                                  the new content there a similar project                                  that did this is a sandbox that we did                                  you can look this up and try it on your                                  own but on the other hand there's also a                                  project that's relatively new it's                                  called feel double panel pains that does                                  that brings in a new entity like the                                  like the custom pains we had before but                                  you can feel them and that that also                                  helps in just being in this dialog                                  creating a new instance of of such an                                  entity and that you provide there you                                  even can decide if you want to reuse                                  this and find this in a listing of                                  the content or you want to have just                                  placed it there so you should definitely                                  have a look at that because this will                                  help also in this type of workflow so                                  there's another area where it really                                  where we have a really little bit                                  problematic situation for the editors                                  because if they want to deal with the                                  menu and this is what a lot of editors                                  think hey I want to have a new menu                                  entry that leads to a new page so what                                  did what do they do in Drupal they go                                  they maybe maybe they know okay I can                                  create a Content and have you know click                                  this link at menu item to that but most                                  of the thing most of the time the                                  editors think in okay i have this menu                                  here and i want to add a new item with                                  with its page or with its content or                                  with whichever is sitting there so when                                  we look at the at the standard menu                                  interface it's pretty isolated we can                                  create an a menu item that we have to                                  know the path so hey this is not this is                                  not an easy situation for an editor                                  because hey you have to open up another                                  tab to find out the URL or what so or                                  you can type something like no dad a lot                                  of people type no dad and hope it will                                  help them so you have to know the path                                  this is not a good situation because you                                  know people get stuck in this situation                                  so um we were we were sitting down and                                  thinking how how can we make this better                                  and and made some plans for that and my                                  colleague Daniel he started and did this                                  new module that's called content menu                                  that helps with that you know it makes                                  it makes it possible to create a new                                  menu item and that can point to in URL                                  or it can you can create a new content                                  with it and you get instantly forwarded                                  to the to the node edit form to fill out                                  the rest of the fields as far as you                                  want for the content and then get back                                  to the                                  uh to the menu as you can see here it's                                  a it's a little bit done like the fields                                  you I where you can have a new entry and                                  on the bottom type in the the title and                                  then choose if you want to have a URL or                                  something else like a new page and or                                  link to an existing content which also                                  is a is a nice view where you can select                                  the content with the configurable view                                  to find that and that helps the editors                                  to get from the start to the end because                                  they can happen you a new menu item                                  decide for what they want to have their                                  they can obviously use what always has                                  been there the URL they even can create                                  a dummy if they just want to build a                                  menu structure and that leads to a much                                  much better workflow in this area so                                  this is an overview you know creating                                  many items deciding for that getting                                  forwarded to the node add page where                                  everything is already filled out for you                                  and then getting back to the main menu                                  after saving and this is a good nice and                                  circular workflow and same goes for the                                  existing content choose existing content                                  get to your view select the content and                                  get back to the main menu and this is a                                  nice way of dealing with that so there                                  was a lot of examples and you know I I                                  sort of rushed through the presentation                                  I almost made it to get back in time                                  yeah thank you are there any questions                                  yeah known the question was if I did                                  check out the menu editor module no I                                  don't know that I would really love to                                  talk with you about that because I'm                                  always looking for new solutions for for                                  these topics I didn't want to provide a                                  really complete overview of all modules                                  that help you there but I won't just                                  wanted to tell you what are these tasks                                  these problems that our editors are                                  facing and it's really great to have                                  different solutions so we should sit                                  down so how was the module called many                                  editor okay interesting yeah you know my                                  colleague Daniel who created the module                                  is over there so maybe you could get                                  your heads together and I don't know was                                  he here ah maybe he has gone it was here                                  before but I can point you in this                                  direction and then you could put your                                  heads together and find common grounds                                  and and maybe you know work on this                                  little further because I think this is                                  an important task there was somebody                                  else                                  no there's nothing that comes yeah yeah                                  so I think sum this up your question was                                  well how to deal with really long menu                                  structures where you can get an overview                                  this is obviously a problem I don't know                                  many good solutions to that you talked                                  about a lot of what what possible                                  solutions there could be like you know                                  paging or getting getting this more                                  compact but sometimes also these                                  approaches to solutions we create more                                  problems I think you know you never can                                  it can avoid you not always can avoid                                  these situations but maybe there's a                                  better one approach would be consulting                                  the client and telling him hey do you                                  really need such a complex menu                                  structure but you know this is this is                                  not a that's what that was not the                                  interface answer I could give there but                                  I think it could be a good approach you                                  know because these many structures tend                                  to also confuse the front end users but                                  yeah yeah use this very vertical tops                                  and almost everything is about to get up                                  and the first one has                                  yeah yeah and for me this seemed like to                                  go today but it never goes the direct                                  feedback on the class because if                                  somewhere yeah yeah and yeah we got                                  feedback from clients but also there's                                  usability studies there's a lot of them                                  and and they show that you know the the                                  compression and that the use of users of                                  the space okay we are talking about                                  vertical tabs here by the way I have to                                  repeat all these questions we're talking                                  about the vertical tabs so this is nice                                  firm from the aspect of how much space                                  we use but the users studies show that                                  people are clicking through all of them                                  to find out what is hidden behind that I                                  think over there is somebody who wants                                  to say something about that                                  okay okay i try to repeat all that there                                  is there you mentioned this problem that                                  you have to save save button right                                  underneath the vertical tabs and users                                  get the idea that they have to save                                  everything that they are editing there                                  and what happens is obviously not the                                  the thing they were hoping that would                                  happen because they get redirected to                                  the save page or anything like that yeah                                  yeah yeah and let me say just one thing                                  before we continue with the questions                                  but I see the people leaving I will                                  really be happy to talk more with you                                  about that so let's get together we make                                  a buffer we get together somehow and                                  exchange all these ideas problems with                                  that we were facing because i'm also                                  interested in whatever what every other                                  person has to deal with so find me and                                  hopefully we can talk about this a                                  little bit more because we're I don't                                  know we run we might be running out of                                  time so I'd be here and I'd be really                                  happy to talk with everybody and yeah so                                  yep actually I don't know how to do this                                  yes I proposed above yeah so um yeah I                                  don't know if we find slot so however we                                  do that this logistically but I think we                                  can I can manage this because everybody                                  else also did it so um yeah thank you                                  for being here yeah and have a nice                                  conference welcome to DNA
