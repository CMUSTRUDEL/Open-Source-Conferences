Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: The project application review process
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	Before users are allowed to publish their Drupal modules or themes as full projects on drupal.org they have to go through a one time approval process. We do that as quality assurance, to detect security problems, licensing issues and wrong usage of Drupal's APIs early. Klaus Purer and Patrick Drotleff are active review administrators on drupal.org and will present the current workflow and how new contributors get involved with their projects on drupal.org. In particular, we will discuss:

The way your module becomes a sandbox and then a full project
The issue queue that is used to coordinate applications
Current status of the application review process and how applicants feel about it
how to retain Drupal talent and ensure security and overall code quality at the same time
Experiments like Review Bonus and how they work out
Review process automation: pareview.sh and ventral.org
Feedback from applicants and some statistics
the everyday life of a drupal.org Git administrator
Mentoring aspects for new contributors
review process governance: decision making and discussion on groups.drupal.org
The path forward: what's next for the project application issue queue?
How can we attract more reviewers?
What should not be automated in the future?
How can we shorten the time frame until a project gets approved?
How you can help!
We will leave enough time for discussion after our talk and we look forward to pick up your input to improve the whole process in the future.

that's basically it hi my name is                                patrick i just started drupal one year                                ago and I pretty soon got stuck in the                                application q estes good sound it's okay                                well i'm working for maloom and i'm also                                a project application administrator and                                my drool dog name is Patrick D okay so                                you might wonder how can you actually                                contribute coat and Drupal a talk so one                                fundamental concept on drupal.org our                                sandboxes sandboxes are git repositories                                that have a project page and a full                                issue tracker that everybody can use for                                free so this is the good message if you                                have code if you have you developed                                module and you want to contribute back                                you can start right now by pushing it to                                a sandbox and where you can collaborate                                with others you can manage your project                                with the issue tracker and so on just                                register on drupal.org click the                                confirmation that you will only publish                                GPL version                                                      required on drupal.org and then you can                                start creating ascend boxes there's also                                a lot of documentation ma'am where can                                read that up how we can do that it's                                quite simple everybody                                do it that's what the typical sandbox                                looks like the it has a not so shiny URL                                which is tied to the username with a                                unique identifier it has the term                                sandbox in the title so that people know                                it is an experimental project that's one                                fundamental thing about sand boxes they                                are considered experimental they are not                                verified project mostly there is new                                code in them you should use them with                                caution if you are deploying that code                                on a production site you should verify                                yourself that it actually works and that                                it does what it's supposed to do and it                                has no downloadable releases as you can                                see there is only the get URL very                                prominently placed on the project page                                so that developers can easily download                                the module but it's not intended for                                end-users for site builders that are                                just looking around you have to know                                what you're doing when you are using a                                sandbox on your Drupal site on the                                contrary we have full project s√∏nderborg                                I'm sure you have seen those use for                                example it's a full project or Drupal                                itself is a full project on Drupal dork                                and the food project is basically a                                sandbox and it has some additional                                gimmicks for example it has a nice                                project URL where the module short name                                or the theme short name is used in a URL                                 it has package releases for download so                                 it is specifically intended to be used                                 by end users it is also favored in                                 search results and food projects are                                 considered to be healthy and maintained                                 and everybody expects that critical bugs                                 or security issues or whatever gets                                 fixed in a timely fashion so that is it                                 is really considered something community                                 supported and I'm sure you have seen                                 that that's a typical project page of a                                 full project on drupal.org the path is /                                 project / the short name of the module                                 or a theme rules in this example it has                                 most of the time it says stable release                                 published that you can download in a                                 tarball it in many times it also has                                 development releases where you can grab                                 the latest nightly slap snap                                 of the repository and it has used its                                 the districts which sandboxes have not                                 because they are not tracked by the                                 Drupal update XML system so you can see                                 how if mrs. module you stuff and has it                                 been downloaded and so on so that's                                 about it for full projects the thing                                 about food projects they are not for                                 free and there's a reason to that and                                 there are several problems with the idea                                 that we should give food projects as to                                 anyone first there's the problem of                                 namespace squatting because you know the                                 internet it's full of spammers if we                                 would give full project away for free                                 people would just reserve the name we                                 would run out of short names very soon                                 so modules would get very long names and                                 so on another thing why we want to hold                                 back things a little for full project is                                 a licensing issue issues because                                 drupal.org is GPL version                                           everything that's compatible to GPL                                 version                                                             drupal association the legal body of                                 drupal org from any issues that might                                 arise when there is copyright                                 infringement or whatever another                                 important thing for group is reputation                                 is of course security we expect from                                 full project that they are basically                                 secure of course security issues can                                 always have meant they do and we have a                                 process in place that use with that                                 issues but in general we consider that                                 the developers that work on that module                                 know what they are doing and they are                                 familiar with security best practices so                                 that everybody can safely use the                                 project so we want to make sure that                                 food project before they are released                                 have secure code in them another problem                                 and I assume you have all stumbled upon                                 that one is project duplication on                                 Drupal a dork we need to make sure that                                 we do not fragment our community in                                 Forks of basically the same project we                                 always emphasize the notion of                                 collaboration over competition we want                                 people to work together we don't want                                 them to fork                                 a project for a minor reason of course                                 if you are new contributor you think you                                 can do everything on your own and you                                 have your idea you can do it right and                                 nobody else can but we have to just push                                 people in the direction of working                                 together and do not duplicate what's                                 already there and we also want to make                                 sure of code quality and best practices                                 because every food project on drupal.org                                 is might get copied because people learn                                 from full project they use them they                                 modify them so we want to have a good                                 code quality in them and we also want                                 them to use best practices how do plate                                 how the group maybe I should be used and                                 another problem are abandoned projects                                 we already have a lot of abandoned                                 projects on Roberto dog because the                                 maintainer have moved on do not have                                 time anymore to maintain the project and                                 if you would open the floodgates and                                 would allow everybody to create food                                 project we would get a lot of abandoned                                 projects where people just dump their                                 code and move on and it would be even                                 harder to find the right modules for                                 your Drupal project so what do we do and                                 we want food projects and we want high                                 quality code so we have a process in                                 place that's the project review process                                 and that works like this and there's a                                 permission on Drupal at work that we can                                 assign to users so that they are able to                                 publish full projects this is a one-time                                 a proof of process so if you have a new                                 module you go to the issue queue EG q is                                 Drupal a dog / project search project                                 application which we use to manage those                                 applications and you bring basically you                                 bring a new project and we bring the                                 reviews so we want to make sure that you                                 have a basic understanding of Drupal and                                 when you are through that you you get                                 the gift vetted user role that's the                                 permission or the user role in Drupal at                                 work so you're able to promote any sand                                 box of yours to a full project so the                                 sandbox is the premier preliminary step                                 you can publish all the code in Drupal a                                 dog in the sandbox it just says that                                 it's experimental and then you get the                                 permission and then you are a verified                                 member and you can publish a code in a                                 full project manner                                 and an important note here if you want                                 to collaborate on an existing project if                                 you want to help maintain views for                                 example the maintain of views can add us                                 maintainer so you don't have to go                                 through this process it's only for new                                 project when new food projects should                                 come out so maintain as can manage                                 themselves if they want to add people as                                 maintenance to their project                                 exactly they don't have to have to get                                 vetted user role it can be just normal                                 drupal dog users they just have to                                 accept the licensing terms before they                                 can commit any code and that's it and                                 then you can commit to views if you have                                 been accepted at maintainer without any                                 approval process so that's that and what                                 happens next your application is then                                 sitting there in the issue queue and                                 people will review a project and                                 everything and if everything went well a                                 code review administrator like me or                                 Patrick or Mickey who is sitting here                                 will approve your project and you get                                 the reddit user role and then you can                                 move on to full projects there's also a                                 list of people that are responsible for                                 that approval process which is listed on                                 groups of drupal org I put the link here                                 you can download the slides after this                                 session and looked it up yourself so                                 there's a basic workflow in place you                                 all know the do block each accuse an                                 issue has a state and we use that state                                 to express some certain condition that                                 apply currently to an application for                                 example need to needs review means that                                 the application is ready to be reviewed                                 by regular drupal.org reviewers the                                 needs work state is used if there are                                 problems with the application licensing                                 issues a security hole whatever so that                                 signals to the maintainer of that                                 sandbox hey you need to correct that                                 before we can publish that the best food                                 project and in the end a reviewer marks                                 that as review and test reviewed and                                 tested by the community so if there are                                 no issues left and the review as                                 confident that this can be published it                                 gets the state and then the code review                                 administrators like us step in and                                 approve that or bump it back to needs                                 work if we find issue for whatever                                 reasons at the close dates if an                                 application goes through it it is marked                                 as fixed if an application is not                                 appropriate for whatever reason it is                                 marked as won't fix and we also have to                                 duplicate state because we want persons                                 to                                 I submit only one project at the time                                 because we already have a huge load of                                 applications coming in so we want to                                 have only one application per person and                                 we mark other applications of the same                                 persons duplicate that's basically the                                 workflow is documented you can also look                                 that up yes some benefits for reviewing                                 applications you might be wondering why                                 are they doing this what what can you                                 take away from that when I started                                 reviewing applications i think in                                 september-october last year i really got                                 a huge learning experience you learn                                 drupal because you look at other others                                 people's code you learn how to do things                                 you learn about alternative ways to                                 solve specific problems you learn how to                                 analyze the raincoat that's a very                                 important skill that you gain and you of                                 course you learn to write secure code                                 because you see what other review is                                 fine and you see how they identify                                 security issues in modules which is                                 really a great game to be a better                                 drupal developer and of course you learn                                 about best and worst practices you see                                 what people do vary in an elegant way                                 and you see what people are doing really                                 wrong and of course you tell them about                                 it and yes you you get to know common                                 patterns how modules can go wrong and                                 what is wrong with them and of course                                 you stay on top of what is new it and                                 hard you see what is missing in Drupal                                 what ideas people come up with how you                                 want to improve trooper by modules for                                 example how they develop their                                 responsive based themes or whatever it's                                 really cool to see that the way forward                                 and what the new ideas that come up with                                 new contributors and in the end you get                                 a lot of camera of course for helping                                 and mentoring others you can make a name                                 for yourself you you're well known in                                 the Drupal community and you can use                                 that for your own projects to promote                                 your own project or getting better                                 feedback for your patches or whatever                                 for sure you cannot simply review                                 modules by random we need a system to do                                 this and to make sure there's a                                 the important points are always checked                                 and we've spent a lot of time to                                 implement a good review checklist and                                 you can see the main points up there                                 it's basically first check if there is a                                 similar module module avail available                                 and if it is asked the applicant whether                                 or how it compares to the existing                                 module is it really necessary to                                 duplicate it and if it's obviously a                                 full functional to placate then closed                                 the issue then also and we only allow                                 one application per user that's because                                 we have a very very high workflow                                 already and we can't just have any one                                                                                                          let's see which one gets fixed first Ted                                 simply doesn't work out so we first have                                 to make sure that one user rule really                                 you only want has one application then                                 many new users are also new to get that                                 means that some of them don't know how                                 to push code onto their git repository                                 some of them even don't know how to                                 create a sandbox and they simply create                                 an application issue so we have to make                                 sure that code is actually dared to                                 review and that they are using the                                 correct names for branching and tagging                                 other issues are a custom licensed a                                 text it's not necessary to add your own                                 license the text because it's added                                 automatically by the packer and for                                 party stuff as close we said it's only a                                 GPL version                                                              underestimated the while reviewing                                 project is the documentation of the                                 project does does the project page                                 contain good good information how to                                 install it how to use it and there                                 should also be a readme available                                 because the most users of G's modules                                 will be site builders and side rules are                                 mostly no developers and they have to                                 understand what this module is doing                                 without looking into the code and the                                 second and most important point is that                                 you are securely and correctly using the                                 Drupal api's and for sure you have no                                 security issues in your code but                                 sometimes can be hard for new reviews                                 but the admins at least we'll have a                                 deep check on this yes we said it                                 already am securities and a very                                 important issue for a new project and                                 the most common issue that we see is                                 cross-site scripting or XSS which you                                 see in this picture is the biggest part                                 of the pie and which means dealing with                                 user-supplied text is dealing with a                                 bomb basically because grupo stores                                 user-supplied text unsanitized and if                                 you print it out you need to defuse that                                 bump so to speak and most people forget                                 that there can be glitches where they                                 not doing it correctly and if that user                                 supply text gets printed without                                 sanitization there might be script tags                                 in it and then JavaScript would be                                 executed and information could be leaked                                 or the account could be taken over or                                 the session cookie could be sended                                 elsewhere whatever so that's the most                                 common issue that we see from time two                                 times there are unprotected many parts                                 in modules that's an example for                                 commerce modules that integrate with                                 some payment gateway for example where                                 the payment gateway calls back to Drupal                                 and often that page callback is                                 unprotected with no permission and then                                 you have to be careful what you're doing                                 in your page called back you have to                                 make sure that this is a valid request                                 from the payment gateway and not                                 something other that hecka might attempt                                 to send at that path so I've seen some                                 issues of that of course please use the                                 form API because when uses a submitting                                 data we need to be careful what how we                                 validate that and how we use that people                                 are often using the                                 PHP superglobal dollar post for example                                 which they should not do the should use                                 the form API we see some cross-site                                 request forgery which means and you are                                 executing an action on a get request so                                 somebody just visits a page and some                                 random stuff gets executed that is not                                 allowed in Drupal because somebody could                                 trick you into clicking that link or                                 following that link and then action is                                 executed on your behalf which you might                                 not have intended so we also see access                                 bypass on any front so every everywhere                                 where user privileges are escalated                                 where they shouldn't shouldn't have been                                 and what it's very rare nowadays is SQL                                 injection because people who are mostly                                 contributing Drupal                                                     there are very few Drupal                                               in group of seven we have two database                                 API which takes good care of SQL                                 injection so dest is really rare now                                 there's also documentation on Drupal                                 doctor writing secure code please read                                 it it's really helpful information how                                 to deal with users applied text and so                                 on another important aspect i want to                                 mention is mentoring of new applicants                                 of course those are new contributors                                 they are new to drupal they are new to                                 the contributed world and we need to                                 take care of them need to take care that                                 they don't turn away we need to support                                 them in a way of creative creating a                                 full project which means we need to give                                 them links to resources it's always good                                 when people can inform themselves so                                 providing good links is really a task                                 for reviewing an application or suggest                                 an alternate alternative solutions more                                 efficient solutions to applicants it                                 really can open their eyes when they see                                 what exactly they did wrong and how it                                 can be done correctly and they are all                                 so eager to solve that issues of course                                 clear instructions are important so                                 where exactly is the problem how should                                 it be solved where can you learn more                                 about that yeah the more specific you                                 are the better for the applicants and of                                 course we need to provide help and                                 encouragement to applicants because as I                                 said Drupal is growing grouper talent is                                 missing as we said yesterday in his keen                                 out and we want those new contributors                                 we want did we don't want them to turn                                 away so it's important to talk to them                                 in an encouraging manner yeah so from my                                 point of view what do i do when i look                                 at project applications first I check                                 the review bonus list I'll talk about                                 the review bonus system a bit later then                                 I check the RT pc issues because I'm a                                 good administrator I can approve people                                 so I look at the LGBT issues then I walk                                 down to the critical issues that didn't                                 get a response in a long time and then I                                 do some random reviews here and there                                 and look after each eq that it is in                                 good shape yeah that's basically it I'm                                 basically introducing new applicants                                 into the queue and mostly approving and                                 two oldest are TBC issues because there                                 are a lot of them already and a lot more                                 there are oldest applications there are                                 many new reviewers who come in and                                 review the newest applications but i                                 highly recommend to review the oldest                                 ones because there are people really                                 writing for once and generally we both                                 giving support and cheering up desperate                                 applicants it's reviewed and tested by                                 the community it's a state in the queue                                 that indicates this application has been                                 looked at no problems have been found we                                 can move on with it hello administrators                                 please take a look at this I think it's                                 ready                                 correct                                 exactly so the issue queue is located on                                 Drupal a dog it is just reused and on it                                 is an armor project page that is used as                                 this application EG q and there we                                 manage the applications yes as triplet                                 just raise your hands if you have any                                 questions and it's even better if you go                                 to the microphone are directly speaking                                 I think we are not that many                                 yes exactly so the comment was that                                 there are                                                               not of not all of them are waiting for                                 review there are lot of issues that need                                 a response from a maintainer of the                                 sandbox and they are approximately                                     open issues that really need review we                                 get to the point release now right now                                 well the queue unfortunately up none of                                 the questions that my question would be                                 if I submit the new project how can                                 there be an issue queue already because                                 it's new and every project has an issue                                 queue it's the every cent box has its                                 own issue queue without being promoted                                 but to a project application is a                                 project which has an issue queue where                                 you should submit your application to so                                 you create a new issue in the queue of                                 the project application project yeah                                 yes                                 exactly so the comment was that is it's                                 an issue to get to actually the gate                                 vetted user role so the project                                 applications issue queue has no code in                                 it it's not a code project it's just a                                 way to manage applications just reusing                                 that the project tools that are in                                 rubidoux org to organize the                                 applications that's it exactly yes so                                 the comment was that in an application                                 issue there's a link to the user submits                                 the application there's a link to the                                 sandbox there's a short description what                                 that user wants to accomplish with the                                 module and then it waits there for                                 review yeah please come to the                                 microphone and we're recording this so                                 either I have to repeat the question or                                 you can speak yourself to the microphone                                 what what's a reasonable time to expect                                 someone to review an application you                                 know if I submitted do i wait a couple                                 day or like wait a couple of weeks and                                 still consider it appropriate because I                                 don't want to start bothering the                                 reviewers so that depends on your                                 application there are certain incentives                                 that you can do so that the project gets                                 reviewed earlier like the review bonus                                 system I get back to that in a couple of                                 minutes and you can of course raise your                                 priority of the issue if you're waiting                                 for two weeks you can raise two major if                                 you're waiting for four weeks you can                                 raise it to critical so then it's more                                 likely that you'll get a review well it                                 won't help you much to make it critical                                 it will help yes that that's in actually                                 an important command Drupal needs my                                 module you need you need to good you                                 need to do good things and talk about                                 them if you promote your project on your                                 own and to get people to know they will                                 of course stop by the issue can review                                 it because they have an interest that is                                 gets promoted to full project so                                 ok any questions lift                                 yes                                 not just us we adjust the administrators                                 who say oh yes the reviews went fine now                                 we can approve it but other people are                                 doing your reviews so we really rely on                                 regular reviewers that stop by and chip                                 in exactly exactly and then if the                                 administrator texts that that review                                 wasn't really a review then yeah it's                                 not a good image for you reviewer                                 themselves and we didn't have actually                                 any problems with that most reviews are                                 quite okay so there are no just setting                                 something to our DBC without any review                                 it works out pretty well I think                                 anything left okay so as we see the                                 queue has some issues and the current                                 status of the queue is there are about                                                                                                      over you and there are                                              applications and they are free to for                                 your birthday so that's pretty much on                                 the other side only one per day gets                                 approved if it's a good day and                                        them have still security issues so you                                 can see that the whole process really is                                 make sense and it's really necessary to                                 check this and the obvious problem is                                 that we have a huge really huge lack of                                 active reviewers which leads to very                                 long des response times very desperate                                 applicants and quite bad reputation to                                 potential new Drupal developers because                                 they are simply mad about how long this                                 time takes to simply approve this                                 project and s the only solution for this                                 is we need more people doing regular                                 reviews and we need even more automation                                 and we need clear documentation so the                                 question is how many reviewers do we                                 need a minimum want but                                 it's very long response times and                                 currently we have three to four five                                 around and still long response times                                 they were desperate applicants would be                                 sustainable if we had at least six to                                 ten people doing regular reviews it                                 would be super awesome if ten people of                                 you in here would start reviewing                                 applications now and we would have a                                 wonderful short response time and a very                                 good reputation for new developers yeah                                 now that was with- let's talk about some                                 accomplishments and how we improve that                                 process in a recent months and years                                 first we have introduced automated                                 review tools to the queue and that has                                 really revolutionized the process the                                 result of that is that we have almost no                                 coding standard issues anymore new                                 projects people are able to use correct                                 git branch names they have comments on                                 every functions so the code is well                                 documented the coding standard time                                 place so that the code that comes in                                 from new country with these contributors                                 is really easy to read and understand                                 and written in a Drupal way and many                                 details more than that detected by those                                 ultimate automated review tools and the                                 good thing about it if I go in in the                                 issue queue and I be nitpicky about the                                 module and I say missing a comma is                                 missing here and the comment is missing                                 here people will take that personally                                 and the good thing about robots and                                 automated review tools is that people                                 just accept anything they tell them or                                 they hate doing a report is coming out                                 and to take it for granted and they fix                                 it and there is no problem so that's                                 really cool and we can focus in our                                 reviews really on the function of the                                 module and can provide feedback on that                                 and we don't have to point out all those                                 tiny coding standard errors or whatever                                 so the comment was that the speed of the                                 the review of the automated robot you                                 can spit out a huge report at one time                                 and not repeating those nitpicky                                 comments all the time from from real                                 human people another question                                 I'll get to that on the next slide yeah                                 so that the question was how that works                                 out technically and we are using some                                 programs that analyze the source code of                                 new projects first there is the classic                                 module coder you may be heard of it                                 which uses regular expressions to find                                 coding standard errors and security                                 issues in group of modules unfortunately                                 it has a lot of false positives that                                 really confuse applicants and they fix                                 things that are not false so they are                                 checked planing they are sanitizing text                                 variables that are not user-supplied                                 text so it doesn't make sense to                                 sanitize them then a better approaches                                 trooper code sniffer which we use a lot                                 it is it uses a parser engine to analyze                                 the source code and it reports issues to                                 that and it's based on PHP code sniffer                                 where we can reuse existing rules and                                 it's really convenient it works                                 independent of Drupal so you can run it                                 for example in your private git                                 repository automatically when you're                                 pushing commits or whatever there's also                                 the APA review shell script which I                                 wrote to do the basic gift checks to                                 clone the project to analyze the source                                 codes it's basically just a wrapper                                 around turbo codes different coda and                                 what Patrick grid is really awesome he                                 took that script to his server and                                 published it on ventral dork where it                                 can just submit get URL to a repository                                 and we just patch it and process the                                 code and spit out a full report of what                                 is going wrong with your code so that's                                 really awesome and everybody can submit                                 repositories repository repositories                                 there and get reports from that and fix                                 them on their own so that is that so how                                 do you avoid the long response times                                 what I introduced is the review bonus                                 system so the problem is the lack of                                 reviewers and what I see is a possible                                 solution is that applicants become                                 reviewers because let's be honest they                                 are just Drupal developers like you and                                 me just the pain don't have that much                                 experience but they basically know what                                 they're doing they're familiar with drew                                 / so they can review other projects and                                 the thing is                                 they review three other project                                 applications and they can add a special                                 tag to their own application so that I                                 know aha this person has helped other                                 people so now it's on my high priority                                 list to look at that coat and to approve                                 it and to move it forward so if you want                                 to avoid long response times just help                                 others and i'll be at your service there                                 are some improvements planned to                                 directly integrate on drupal.org to NH                                 the whole process itself first of all we                                 want to integrate the automated review                                 service completely under build org so                                 they don't have to go to an external                                 site and submit it manually every time                                 and we want to make sure that the                                 workflow is followed so that if the hu                                 is created that automatically you can                                 know can be learn at less than six                                 errors and RPC issues are also proved                                 after a number of weeks and Jeremy                                 already implemented some of the stuff in                                 a sandbox which is really cool but can't                                 be pushed into Drupal at orrick life yet                                 and we will really looking forward to                                 this and we heard of many applicants                                 that they are really waiting for these                                 features to have on drupal.org and to                                 make it easier for them and for us                                 there are several other ideas for                                 improvements many of them also came from                                 applicants yourself for example this one                                 came from fonk lousy and he said let's                                 make review bonus mandatory so if you                                 want to get rude oh it through the                                 process you have to review free other                                 applications unfortunately it turns out                                 that many many applicants simply don't                                 have time to do this and therefore it's                                 not yet official they are issue queue                                 free shots which means that we should                                 not longer than four weeks wait for a                                 project to be finished and we also think                                 about having a really reviewed team at                                 the moment there's no real governments                                 and on this whole thing it's just do you                                 want to make reviews yes then do it but                                 there's no real team that you can say                                 hey these are the people who really                                 regularly do the reviews likes and the                                 documentation team we're even leaders                                 are defined then there's also often a                                 problem thats there are very specific                                 applications like m-commerce plugins and                                 i personally don't have very much I                                 don't know very much about Commerce and                                 how to integrate with it so the idea was                                 to add text to do to do applications                                 that show people who know something                                 about Commerce that this is the I issue                                 that they could look at so really                                 experts can do reviews on things that                                 they know about unfortunately that's not                                 really working out yet because simply                                 experts are not looking into the                                 application here and also often proposed                                 was that we are separating the approve                                 meant of modules seams and features                                 because                                 seems and modules are not really the                                 same especially when it's about security                                 and the correct API usage so it would be                                 a solution to to simply separate this to                                 make sure that a sim developer adan                                 creates a secure other module module                                 security issues one year later because                                 he never he never was told how this                                 works really question so how could there                                 be a mandatory refu bonus for new                                 developer so if I submit for the first                                 time how can I earn a referee bonus by                                 reviewing other modules because I muted                                 and how can I refuse them so I add was                                 required so don't have to repeat it and                                 there's extensive documentation on                                 drupal.org there's the simple checklist                                 that you can use to check out other                                 people's code it's not that hard you                                 just open the code files you can either                                 look that look at them in your browser                                 with the git repository browser on                                 Drupal dork or you can just clone the                                 project take a look at the code and what                                 you find is good and if you find nothing                                 it's totally ok to set it to rtb see                                 which says I have not found any issues                                 and this can move forward so nobody will                                 shout at you if you have not seen and an                                 issue for example that might turn out                                 later but getting started with reviewing                                 other applications definitely need some                                 time you need some practice with it and                                 you have to do it more often Lee but                                 what's the cool thing about this is by                                 reviewing other applications you really                                 learn many new things and it's simply if                                 we demand from applicants that they need                                 to review other modules we can make even                                 sure odense these applicants are really                                 knowing what they're doing because                                 they're showing it us in their reviews                                 not a question                                 so the question was that mathematically                                 if there are more reviews than                                 application problem we never had that                                 problem that's that's a very esoteric                                 discussion yeah we haven't we haven't                                 decided anything about making required                                 with just leaving it as is right now                                 yeah so that's also another point about                                 feedback and governance we've done some                                 surveys about how applicants think about                                 the process and these are the comments                                 that they most often showed up with and                                 many sites did often thought about                                 giving up I research the review bonus                                 bonus help me getting through within a                                 week a the long response times are very                                 frustrating and we also very often heard                                 that the process in is really good and I                                 appreciate that Wow and if we ask them                                 what should be changed then we mostly                                 had having more reviews is essential for                                 sustainable response times yeah we also                                 think this and more automation directly                                 on drupal.org yeah reviewer should be                                 less picky Wow well sorry and that's                                 often a problem and we're already trying                                 to not be too picky on especially on                                 coding style and but we simply have to                                 be picky on security and API miss you                                 should miss you too miss usage issues so                                 bear with us and sometimes we often                                 heard that sometimes we often well                                 sometimes we heard that the                                 documentation should be more corrosive                                 and less duplicating meaning that many                                 of the documentation is spread over                                 several nodes and its many duplicating                                 information on them and it's our mass of                                 texts to read for new applicants so what                                 they do                                 nothing they don't reach any of the                                 documentation simply created an                                 application and and we wonder how this                                 could happen and we really playing to                                 work on this and we're looking forward                                 to anyone who wants to help us and                                 others very thought that it shouldn't                                 change at all yeah here's something a                                 bit about review process governance well                                 who decides what we are doing in the                                 queue and who decides what we are                                 accepting and who decides how this work                                 for should go well we all do we have a                                 code review group that's the name of the                                 of a group on groups that drupal.org and                                 we do discussions there and we do some                                 decision-making there and this process                                 that we currently have is still evolving                                 we're planning to do more automation we                                 are we thinking about how we can enhance                                 it to so that we have less not that long                                 response times and in the end we all                                 work it out together how drew blood work                                 should work often there are comments we                                 should just enhance sandbox or so that                                 they have downloadable release that                                 would be enough for some applicants but                                 on the other hand we don't want that                                 because the sandboxes are considered                                 experimental and we don't want to mix                                 that up so yeah we we can figure it out                                 together and discuss how we should move                                 forward yes there's a question                                 yup                                 yep                                 yes                                 I                                 project needed process so the comment                                 was that we might have a wish list of                                 modules that do not exist but we might                                 like to have and then new contributors                                 can step in and fulfill the task and                                 then it sits as it is a desired feature                                 it would gather it would get the reviews                                 sooner and it would be a better process                                 yes that might be an idea but the                                 question is who maintains that wish list                                 and so on I think if so if somebody                                 steps up and would like to do something                                 like that it wouldn't be an issue I                                 think it would be very much appreciated                                 yeah so some next steps of course we are                                 always recruiting so if you have five                                 minutes of time ten minutes of time take                                 a look at the project application EG q                                 and if you find something interesting if                                 you see a module debt or a theme that                                 needs review just take a look at the                                 code and if you think it's sane and it                                 does not violate anything that you have                                 seen a group of the dog marketers are                                 TBC and we will really appreciate your                                 help it helps to keep this process going                                 and we are finishing the drupal                                 drupal.org drupal                                                    because we don't want to build tools for                                 drupal                                                                 until this is on drupal                                              don't waste our time implementing                                 something and we of course have to                                 revisit our automation plans what rules                                 exactly do we want to implement for the                                 project application is GQ how it should                                 work we will have to make plans for that                                 and then in the end we will implement                                 that and publish that Andrew blood org                                 so that we don't need the external                                 service for automated reviews that we                                 have for example automated security                                 issue review yes and so forth

                            drupalcon website can just click on                                 sprint and we will be there yeah and we                                 already said that we are encouraging                                 applicants read each other by the review                                 go on a bonus and we are also having now                                 the project review wetness day whereas                                 once a week this juice RSS feed from                                  Drupal planets and where I am project                                  sitting any application cubes promoted                                  and said hey if you wanted review it and                                  we also thinking about a kind of                                  application q spotlight so we can show                                  people who doing read who are doing                                  reviews regularly and say hey these                                  people are awesome and we hope that by                                  doing this more people want to get into                                  this because they simply can make their                                  self a name and they can get known by                                  this so finally let's come to the points                                  sort of the stuff that you actually                                  should remember about the key messages                                  are every one of you can publish code                                  directly sandbox projects are also a                                  kind of contribution because dump your                                  coat if you don't want to maintain it                                  okay leave it in the sandbox                                  if you want to maintain it come to US                                  nuclear application queue then we need                                  help really we need your help to review                                  project applications and third point is                                  that review automation must be the                                  future because if the count of reviewers                                  doesn't rise with two counts of                                  applicants we have a huge problem in                                  queue we have also a list of resources                                  where you can we can join us and figure                                  out how to review applications find out                                  more information about the issue queue                                  itself and we also have a Drupal review                                  account on Twitter where we are always                                  tweeting about the discussions and under                                  the newest projects going on in the                                  application Q so please follow it so you                                  will remember that you want to help us                                  so any questions left                                  hi my name is Benjamin balancin and I                                  actually also have the the privilege of                                  promoting projects to full get projects                                  so the extent that there's a problem and                                  I think they're there still is what I am                                  a a large part of it because I have been                                  very absent involvement and actually                                  even just check in handling the things                                  that are already rtb seed I think we                                  just have a fundamental inequality                                  that's sort of untenable in that we                                  expect more from brand new contributors                                  of projects than we expect of people                                  have projects I have                                                 whatever i have my clearly not                                  maintaining them well if i don't                                  remember the exact number and you know i                                  can pop off a project right that no                                  review whatsoever I'm not you know one                                  doesn't have to be up on the latest                                  security api's or anything to just do                                  that but also I'm invest in Drupal i'm                                  not going to walk away if someone says                                  will hold on like let's you know look at                                  your project a little more if someone                                  just sits and gets nothing so that then                                  that's really really bad first                                  experience for people's like first big                                  involvement I do think we have to be                                  much clearer that your project is fully                                  usable as a sandbox project and all of                                  that it is a different regime but                                  there's just that fundamental inequality                                  that personally I would love us to move                                  towards their system where every project                                  needed this some kind of process to                                  become a full project and then we're all                                  in the same boat together and all the                                  module developers who and people have                                  the grandfathered access from like the                                  days of CVS you say oh no I never want                                  to go to this process well now they have                                  to get involved and make it work for                                  everybody that's considered untenable                                  because that would                                  for what Drupal errs some                                              more                                                                  that we have to review but honestly I                                  really feel that we have an inequality                                  between new contributors and existing                                  contributors that I'd rather see us                                  thrown into a sinking boat together than                                  just sort of have new people like waiver                                  like this but there's been an awesome                                  job and so please everyone get involved                                  in the queue and let's try to treat the                                  new people as great as possible but                                  there's middle ground whereas the                                  automated reviews can start to apply to                                  all projects so these are the you know                                  anything that can be done to make the                                  make it equal between existing                                  contributors and new contributors I                                  think that's a huge step forward and I                                  am gonna keep trying to help thanks                                  thanks yeah you're quite right about                                  that inequality but I think there's one                                  aspect to it I think we have to be a bit                                  more pushy to new contributors because                                  there are the old foxes like you that                                  are around and then basically know what                                  they're doing they're not doing very                                  very critical mistakes and of course                                  it's possible that the experience to PO                                  developer will have a security issue in                                  his or her module but it's less likely                                  and I think we have to be a bit pushy                                  and a bit nitpicky about new                                  contributors because we do it only once                                  we could change that and have this                                  sinking boat we are all thinking all                                  modules have to go through the process                                  but it's currently we don't have the                                  resources for that so it's not quite                                  sustainably we have we haven't figured                                  that out but on the other hand maybe it                                  attracts a lot of reviewers if every                                  foot project has to go through that                                  application fluid review more people                                  would be in the queue and more people                                  would maybe review maybe it would be                                  better I guess the main other thing I                                  would suggest as farther the ball equal                                  approach is that did not be the the get                                  administrator able to approve / position                                  anymore but anyone else who has one or                                  maybe three projects that already can                                  is automatically without any application                                  able to approve other people's but that                                  there'd be like a public record of that                                  so that your name is attached to a                                  project so that everyone has their                                  reputation staked on the project they                                  approve and it should still you know                                  have a review process now but we again                                  we remove this bottleneck that you know                                  basically makes us the target of the IR                                  it's like no this is how the Drupal                                  community works you have a project to                                  apply anybody with a project in Drupal                                  can approve it and again it we have two                                  more people understand that anyone in                                  Drupal can review your project so                                  putting more literature up front in the                                  review application process that you know                                  Drupal is done as a community here's how                                  you get involved in the community and                                  get someone to review yours of course                                  doing your own reviews but all this is                                  overlap but if you know you just know                                  that anyone in Drupal can do it it's up                                  to you to to you know help make that                                  happen I think that's teaching people                                  how this project should work and that                                  for someone who is an established drupal                                  developer it's not hard to find someone                                  to sign off on their project it'll know                                  like that so I don't think it'd be                                  owners for established people and but it                                  would actually be at least be                                  technically equal sorry mmm I think                                  that's a good command actually I was                                  just thinking that I'm a true if all                                  users on drupal.org are on the same page                                  for example regarding duplication and                                  fragmentation so we have quite some                                  applications that we just closed and say                                  hey please talk to that maintainer that                                  project already exists please                                  collaborate please do not create another                                  view slideshow module please don't don't                                  do it and yeah that might be a problem                                  because other users disagree to say the                                  more modules the better the more                                  contributors the better and the chest                                  would approve someone which might not be                                  desired by the overall community so yeah                                  but that's sort of the spot where the                                  inequality calls people the most because                                  yeah you're already out there if you                                  once you get through the process with                                  some other module then you can release                                  that review slideshow so these yeah I                                  mean it's I honestly think that for                                  things like that where there's no way                                  like right now anything that's a                                  security issue or even API issues                                  there's it's feasible that someone will                                  go into in a module you know will go                                  into a module that's already out there                                  and say no this one is shut down or                                  whatever if it doesn't live up to it                                  there's no way that's going to happen                                  the community is not going to go and say                                  tell me that I that the module I made is                                  a duplicitous to be shut down and so                                  that is an inequality that we're facing                                  new people to that I I think we just                                  can't do that if we don't want duplicate                                  projects then we have to have a                                  community-wide thing we can't we can't                                  put gates on new contributors that we                                  don't even pretend to ever put on                                  existing contributors and so we as a                                  community want to prevent duplicate                                  projects then we have to we have to put                                  that gate up separately but I think I                                  think that's key and I think we have to                                  drop that gate from the project review                                  process we can we can encourage we can                                  nudge but I don't think we can enforce                                  it as an absolute gate because it's just                                  not equal                                  so                                  what happens if I submit the project                                  then you cannot accept it because it has                                  some issues do I have to reapply or what                                  happens next so the the issue has a                                  comment follow up I post a comment and I                                  say you have to fix this you have to fix                                  that because of the security issue and I                                  put it as needs work then you work on                                  your project commit the new code and                                  then you say hey I fix that I'm ready to                                  review again and set it back to needs                                  review in a comment after that it's just                                  that the standard issue queue workflow                                  as we are using on other modules just a                                  little reused for project for                                  applications any other questions or                                  other useful comments yeah first of all                                  thanks for all the great work I think                                  it's it's amazing what you gotta pull up                                  there thank you so I think in general                                  it's it's possible to get your project                                  proof because I'll i don't know if that                                  common walls by me I think I got through                                  in                                                                     definitely being is a more centralized                                  documentation because at some point i                                  read with the review bonus program that                                  i shouldn't like                                  review one project a couple of times and                                  then I thought well that's weird because                                  I mean I already know the project then                                  how the module and it would be better if                                  i'll just stick to it and see okay does                                  the does the owner actually come back to                                  the stuff that i suggested another post                                  and it basically said that i also think                                  it's all I was shocked by the amount of                                  projects that were committed where                                  people were just lacking basic basic                                  stuff like wrong get your L or they have                                                                                                         project not being being accepted now or                                  just basic checklist stuff and so I                                  would just go there and say well please                                  go to that link read it all and don't                                  come back you can't say don't come back                                  I mean I read a couple of projects and                                  basically up I think five times I just                                  wrote the same the same stuff okay yo                                  get URL should look like this please                                  take a look at that well you're the you                                  have coding coding garland issues and so                                  that's just the stuff that might take a                                  lot of work now and the second point is                                  that maybe                                  and also be a different or two different                                  levels because what I didn't really                                  figure out in the beginning was that                                  it's I mean with no more when I get into                                  the bonus review program and then when I                                  have that and when I flag it and then                                  you take a look at my coat and I just                                  have basic stuff wrong and I kind of                                  wasted three reviews I'm evil oh no no                                  no not at all but so so therefore I got                                  in touch with other without other                                  applicants and say okay I read with your                                  project can you just read your mind yeah                                  to get the basic stuff covered and are                                  in that way I also get the review said I                                  need for the bonus program and then I                                  can just tell you okay can now take a                                  look and I think that's a lot easier for                                  you because I don't have to deal with                                  the really basic stuff and so many it                                  would be a good way to promote that kind                                  of collaboration yeah a bit more to                                  basically say okay if you really want to                                  get things done get in touch with other                                  people and work together review your                                  stuff and then do it in that way but                                  yeah that's my other but as I said                                  thanks the great work thanks because of                                  the documentation you mentioned we are                                  also planning to work on a documentation                                  on Friday so we really want to arrange                                  the documentation we want to talk about                                  the future of the process we also want                                  to review some of the applications and                                  please please join us you're really                                  looking forward to anyone who comes so                                  we are not alone we will also we will                                  also do some discussion about automation                                  plans or how we can tackle some of those                                  issues and what you mentioned is I                                  started to build those automated review                                  tools because I was repeating myself all                                  the time and in the issue queue I found                                  the very same issues in                                  in all the new project that have applied                                  then I realized people are often using                                  the the wrong Commission in the menu                                  callbacks and then I took a look at the                                  example documentation for hook menu and                                  the default what the default permission                                  was access administration pages which                                  totally doesn't make sense for an                                  administration configuration so if                                  somebody can enter code just visit                                  administration pages not enough it's the                                  wrong permission and because it wasn't                                  that example documentation people were                                  using it a lot so overall documentation                                  improvement for Drupal is also a great                                  help for making new contributions better                                  and more adhering to standards                                  so the comment was integrating the                                  automation stuff its report would be a                                  huge step I I agree so I think you are                                  running out of time so thanks all for                                  coming I hope I see you on Friday you                                  have to do at least one one application                                  or I will slap you now okay just a joke                                  it's on the general venue code sprint I                                  don't know what room that is right now                                  it's on the group work on website so                                  hope to see you there thanks for coming
