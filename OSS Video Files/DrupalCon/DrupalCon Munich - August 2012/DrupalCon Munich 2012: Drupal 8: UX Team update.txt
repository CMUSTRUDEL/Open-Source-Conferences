Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Drupal 8: UX Team update
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	This session will give an overview from the UX-Team members Bojhan Somers (bojhan), Dharmesh Mistry (dcmistry), how they are redesigning Drupal 8. There is a whole new set of challenges and in this talk, we will give an indepth view on current progress and problems.

This talk will cover three major topics:

Content, Blocks & Layout and Mobile
We have being active in a number of design activies in redesigning the current content creation screen, placing of blocks in layouts and making Drupal mobile friendly. We will give a quick overview what is currently happening and what the end-point is for Drupal 8.
Usability test coverage
Since Drupal 8 development started we have done more usability research activities than ever before. We will share our ideas around getting full testing coverage of core and how we doing community-based testing.
Significant lack of resources
We want to take time to discuss the elephant in the room, our current lack of resources. The influx of resources and activities that D7UX generated, has largely faded and we are now struggeling even to implement the smallest changes to core.
We would like this session to be more indepth, providing core developers a good insight in how we are trying to improve the UX of Drupal 8.

	                              I                               alright let's get started so I want to                               beat I want to talk to you today about                               kind of what do you exit EMS been doing                               for Drupal                                                            know I'm volumes homers and I'm the UX                               maintainer of Drupal                                                and actually graduated yesterday so I'm                               finished with school thank you so I want                                to talk about two things today I want to                                talk about the current initiatives kind                                of the things that we've been doing and                                the main well challenge that we have                                with I think well a couple more months                                to go we want to still work on kind of                                three major things we want to work on                                the content creation and editing we want                                to work on blocks and layout and we want                                to work on the mobile so let me start                                with content creation it's not an                                official initiative but we thought you                                know this is kind of one of the things                                in core that is very bland it's it's not                                very striking for a content management                                system so we feels kind of broken and we                                want to improve it and I think we've                                done over a hundred usability tests on                                this particular screen and found a whole                                range of issues some of them the more                                important ones is that people don't                                really know whether this content is                                published or not only editing it's not                                really clear to them especially when                                they have a kind of a complete editing                                workflow that's information that's                                really important and it's somewhere down                                in the vertical tab another thing is the                                vertical taps themselves when we                                introduce them we thought they were                                going to be awesome and and they work                                really well but they are hard to scan                                and it's it's really hard                                when there's a lot of contributed                                modules for it for it to not look                                cluttered so that's another issue and                                obviously previewing well this is a bit                                weird I guess it's a drupal ism because                                when you look at this preview people go                                what the because it's not in the                                front end right a preview should be in                                the front end so they're confused by                                this and they're even more confused that                                there's two different kind of previews                                so with this we started looking at you                                know what do our competitors do you know                                we try to do a comparison looking at                                what Drupal does and what other systems                                do and we looked at the whole range of                                CMS like WordPress Joomla movable-type                                hippo which is a Dutch CMS and we                                noticed that well the content creation                                screens aren't necessarily very well                                designed either often they designed very                                individual fields but when whenever they                                threw in a WYSIWYG it looks you know all                                mashed up because of that particular                                WYSIWYG so it doesn't really match the                                visual style of the admin but still in                                comparison to Drupal they're all pretty                                okay like over-the-top styling like                                joomla or very minimalistic styling like                                text pattern so we collaborated with                                Jared punch who works for all about and                                to go over a few like design rounds very                                good research and with iterate on the                                design and we push these iterations out                                into the community for feedback and in                                the final round we now have this and                                this is also the design that's being                                implemented it includes a sidebar we're                                on the top you have your kind of meta                                information that it's published or not                                better it's saved or not and then you                                have the accordion of configuration                                items so that on the left all you're                                doing on the left is always just doing                                the content creation and and this was                                received really well by participants we                                did a usability study and we found a                                number of small issues but overall it                                stands                                people really understand that on the                                Left I just do this and on the right I                                just have all my meta stuff that if I                                want to I can configure so that's for                                content creation the spark team I think                                during this week there's there's already                                been some announcements and and some                                demos of spark stuff they're working on                                 like inline editing it's likely just to                                 complement this because you know people                                 still have to do creation so it's really                                 just for editing and we've provided                                 feedback to the year to the spark team                                 there there are a number of UX and                                 accessibility issues that need to be                                 resolved for spark but we think it's                                 it's in a it's going to be in a good                                 shape to get into core so that's all                                 about content creation then mobile so                                 we've been working with the mobile                                 initiative and really focus on basically                                 making Drupal                                                     visitors and site administrators and I                                 think many in the community can                                 understand that at the urgency of doing                                 this probably already a year ago but no                                 we want to have it in you do paid at                                 least and there's a whole bunch of tasks                                 that the mobile initiative set out the                                 UX team is really only focusing on this                                 part so the ability to use drupal's and                                 minute if forms in mobile devices and to                                 do this we really need to design kind of                                 the complete stack of administrative                                 tasks so no primary secondary tabs the                                 toolbar                                                               designed for mobile we've already                                 achieved us think a small small                                 achievements through Jonah Albin has                                 been doing a lot of work in helping to                                 make this happen so Bartok is already                                 responsive I think stark is already                                 responsive so we really only have seven                                 left so I hope sorry Oh garland is gone                                 well that helps always helps so we                                 really have only seven left so designing                                 seven is quite quite a challenge we                                 still have a long way to go but Lewis                                 Neiman has been working really hard                                 working on prototypes for the navigation                                 because no this is stuff you really have                                 to try out and the prototype so far kind                                 of allows you to very smoothly move down                                 the navigation just by navigating the                                 list basically but we didn't we didn't                                 stop there we didn't stop by just                                 navigation because a lot of the stuff                                 that's on the page needs to be designed                                 as well so whenever you come to for                                 example the content listing you don't                                 want the first half of your mobile                                 screen to be filled up with the action                                 link and the weird filters that we have                                 in core so a trick that we tried there                                 is to put the action link in in the top                                 bar so you can you can press the plus                                 and then you get to that action when                                 there are several actions it might                                 collapse into several actions and you                                 have a search button but you also have a                                 filter button so the filter is initially                                 hidden from view only when you selected                                 in the toolbar are you going to show it                                 on your mobile screen it's I think it's                                 quite the challenge to move this forward                                 there's there's new patterns and new                                 technologies coming in and well every                                 day pretty much and we need to design                                 the spread and so they skill to kind of                                 all of the crazy things you can do in                                 core because you know managing your                                 fields in on your mobile phone is going                                 to be very different from doing content                                 creation so there's a prototype Louise                                 Nieman is working on this one it's not a                                 mobile app so it's really a responsive                                 admin team and I think that to the                                 actual prototype because I felt this is                                 something you have to try out it's still                                 a rough prototype but in terms of focus                                 i think it's it's important to say that                                 we're not just focusing on content                                 creation i think that's something we                                 have to do obviously and and a great                                 part of doing this but we also want to                                 leverage you know site building because                                 we think that's an essential part of the                                 drupal experience maybe if more so than                                 then content creation for a lot of our                                 community members so i think the biggest                                 mistake that we had in drupal                                           we really only focus on content                                 creation in terms of UX and we really                                 forgot think forgot to improve things                                 for site builders now you in this room                                 we really didn't improve that much                                 around the backs of no menus terms                                 blocks that's still pretty much the same                                 in Drupal                                                                still want to try and do some of that in                                 the upcoming months and if you look at                                 kind of our while competitors or friends                                 in this field they're really innovating                                 hard on these elements you know these                                 building blocks or building your site                                 and the Laird initiative sets out to                                 basically revamp something we haven't                                 changed in long well which is the the                                 placement of blocks and the creation of                                 layouts and we've been thinking about                                 this I think for well over a year now                                 you know brainstorming and designing                                 things so I'm quite quite excited about                                 this and I think it's a fundamental you                                 export that we still can improve so                                 let's look at the current state it's                                 pretty ugly you have your blocks and you                                 place them in one layout that that's                                 pretty much what you can do you can                                 maybe supply some URL arguments for                                 certain blocks do not show up on certain                                 pages but that's about it but this model                                 is quite outdated right this is the one                                 page site kind of model and it worked                                 maybe in                                                              the problems that users have they                                 experience this gap and we didn't really                                 make it any better in Drupal                                           you know this is your side and this is                                 how he administered doing you're placing                                 your blocks and it doesn't really match                                 there's a whole gap in between as to                                 where their blocks go and how it's going                                 to end up looking so there's no almost                                 no queues for users to really administer                                 the blocks well and that's not all in                                 the testing that we did at the I think                                 the University of Minnesota in                                         found that people have a really hard                                 time grasping kind of the conceptual                                 model of Drupal in that                                 they think it's all just content blocks                                 on the page whereas a drupal developer                                 knows you know that's a note block you                                 know that's a custom log that's that's                                 another custom blog that's maybe a few                                 maybe slideshow that's the main menu                                 block they don't really know how to                                 access all of those modules and they                                 have to learn all these different kind                                 of concepts you have to know fuse they                                 have to know no note blocks they all                                 know all this all this stuff to get that                                 page and if you look at all of the                                 different modules that do this you know                                 panels beans they all do it in older                                 their their own ways so there's no no                                 pattern in how you would you know place                                 a block on this page other than the                                 course bocklage and obviously our                                 competitors are way ahead of this if you                                 look at you know Squarespace there are                                 already allowing a lot of like very cool                                 drag and dropping of blocks but what do                                 most of them suck at dynamic                                 configuration making a custom landing                                 page is actually quite easy from aux                                 perspective but making a landing page or                                 page that you know shows a different                                 image when you're watching the French                                 version from the English version or                                 showing different content when you're                                 logged in or logged out those kinds of                                 dynamic configurations are really tough                                 to do because then it goes beyond you                                 know setting those custom variables to                                 inheriting configuration and all of that                                 so the conceptual module that we made is                                 that we think that this whole experience                                 exists out of three parts there's the                                 page library we're kind of all of your                                 pages live there's a component library                                 where all of the blocks live and then                                 there's the drag-and-drop editor where                                 basically all of this comes together and                                 then you end up having your page so                                 again we made a prototype you can access                                 it from here it's a prototype that that                                 tries to build this whole experience so                                 I i really suggest you try it out                                 I'm not yet fully pleased with where it                                 is it allows for you know the creation                                 of blocks placement of blocks but there                                 are still some parts that are difficult                                 to understand especially if we want this                                 to be usable for for content creators                                 and site builders we're just starting                                 out with Drupal I think the big question                                 though I know now that we've seen all of                                 this how are we going to make it happen                                 because if you look at drupa                                           look at super eight there's pretty much                                 no difference and that's worrisome                                 because I think after what they said                                    months or something of code slush having                                 no noticeable difference is a problem                                 and and I've tried to wrap my head                                 around why we have no difference there                                 and why it's it's all the same and well                                 obviously it boils down to this I mean                                 every initiative has this problem and                                 having been in the community for I think                                 you know for years now trying to build                                 UX team I think that the domain no                                 problems that we found that that we                                 found it really hard in terms of the UX                                 team for people to get involved in you I                                 discussions there there most of the time                                 they're pretty heavy and very intense                                 and I think the UX team is now around                                 two or three people in terms of staff                                 which is a very high bus factor                                 especially when they're kind of                                 responsive for all of the UI in core                                 right and in the last six months know a                                 couple of us had well you know others                                 other circumstances why we couldn't                                 dedicate full-time or part-time or                                 volunteer time to do poke or so know                                 very little happened really so Angie                                 told me there's a similar situation                                 ducks team where there's a really high                                 bus factor and and it's a big problem                                 and and if you look at the ways that we                                 try to solve this most of the times at                                 least in Drupal                                                     party stepped in right during the d                                     project okya stepped in and really fun                                 that mark Bolton a nicer right child to                                 work                                 all of the UX in g                                                  think it propelled a significant amount                                 of activity in just the community but                                 also in actually changing the product                                 and in Drupal                                                          to do something similar but but a little                                 bit of a different model and again                                 they're trying to propel significant                                 improvements to Dux of triple but I                                 think this is also a sign of a clear                                 structural problem that there's just                                 just just one company that's jumping in                                 to help out on you x and i think the                                 structural reason that this is it's                                 because we have a very small product                                 community i think we have a very big                                 community works on the of the framework                                 or at least the high technical                                 challenges but we have a very small                                 community that works just on kind of the                                 whole the end user features and i think                                 that's really the core reason x ux                                 doesn't progress as much as it but at                                 least as we want it to be because it's                                 really not the lack of designers but                                 it's really the kind of powerless                                 position that they're in in terms of                                 executing upon UX IDs so in terms of                                 solutions how we could solve this and I                                 would really like to see more discussion                                 about this is I think we can learn from                                 some things for example that that did                                 went well when it comes to these seven                                 UX one of the things that went well with                                 with you seven you access that because                                 of the continuous kind of funding of                                 development activity a lot of other                                 activity spiraled like the lone warriors                                 would work on one feature got their                                 feedback got their reviews and it was                                 really that continuous activity that                                 also spiraled into continuous                                 improvements to Drupal core so whenever                                 we people see duper core moving you know                                 even from a visual standpoint just by                                 now changing features changing how it                                 looks people get the feeling that it's                                 that is moving and they can contribute                                 it to it and that's not the case right                                 now we haven't you know really changed                                 so much and I think it's also the very                                 open design process we try to mimic that                                 in the US bt group now                                 but it's very difficult to do that kind                                 of intense process so I think those are                                 some of the solutions if we try to bring                                 that back into the Drupal                                               or maybe duple                                                    continues in your funded development and                                 momentum by doing a lot of smaller                                 changes is when we can get you know more                                 activity and and kind of grow that                                 product focused community and that's                                 about it any questions discussions                                 columns or something and we have                                 i usually use the vertical                                 so I think that different patterns are                                 right yeah and so so we actually did                                 that we have a research post up on one                                 kind of the research that we did for the                                 content creation post and we looked at a                                 number of like very commonly used                                 contract modules like yeah it's also                                 filled group which i think you know in                                 combination this fish feeders there's                                 all kinds of things you can do from                                 horizontal to vertical vertical tabs and                                 different kinds of groupings so we did                                 we did look at that and we also try to                                 take inspiration from contract because                                 that's often where things are                                 experimented and especially with distros                                 now I think there are pushing the                                 brownish in terms of UX and things we                                 can incorporate                                 okay sure utter yeah sure                                 so well in terms of spark we have been                                 in discussion I mean we haven't been in                                 discussion about the mobile stuff but we                                 have been in discussion about inline                                 editing and the layout a configuration I                                 think I think the plan moving forward is                                 that they decide what they're going to                                 push towards core and and we're going to                                 decide whether we're going to take that                                 as input or whether we're going to                                 actually take over those IDs especially                                 for mobile it's it's true I think you                                 know the Ember design that they did is                                 very different and there are some good                                 qualities to that there are some bad                                 qualities to that so it's likely that                                 we're just gonna you know flip and merge                                 whatever good things and then move                                 forward that's at least that's that's                                 the idea should I actually have a                                 question that I wanted to follow up to I                                 feel like this the spark demos were                                 really fascinating really interesting                                 and I'm not sure that they did something                                 completely different I think what they                                 did is they took Louis's stuff which was                                 really focused just for like mobile                                 navigation and not looking at the                                 desktop side and the spark team tried to                                 integrate those into a sort of cohesive                                 navigation experience that works in sort                                 of both spaces and and they sort of you                                 know used Louis's work as inspiration                                 and and reuse some of that stuff so I                                 don't feel like they threw it out and it                                 did something different right that's my                                 opinion and Micah my question is like                                 sort of about UX resources what sort of                                 things that do you feel like our good                                 things for to get more UX people do you                                 need like people trying to analyze                                 problems and sort of come up with the                                 pain points in order to create sets of                                 criteria needing people then you know                                 coming up with ideas too there's a this                                 is UX process that I don't see happening                                 on a lot of issues right um how do we                                 how do we can we get developers working                                 on creating sets of criterias you know                                 how what can we improve that bit of the                                 process Andrew make resourcing easier                                 for                                 you know you excite well I mean in terms                                 of the process I mean the UX process is                                 a bit weird right because we're three                                 people so on some issues you know we                                 decide this is a big issue where we're                                 going to try and add process to this you                                 know for example with the module page we                                 designed with the content creation we                                 designed with the blocks layout we                                 decide you know we're going to take our                                 full process and we're first going to do                                 research prototyping then we're gonna                                 design something and then we're going to                                 validate that design again and see you                                 know know how far it is but for a lot of                                 small issues that's just not feasible in                                 terms of resources in terms of resources                                 we would like to see there is I think                                 more I think more interaction designers                                 we ever share a bit of researchers now                                 and we can actually put up a research                                 test plan and actually perform it within                                 you know two weeks so that's really good                                 but yeah we don't have a null of                                 interacting science and then as I was                                 saying we really don't have the                                 development capacity to execute upon                                 those ideas I think a lot of good ideas                                 are still lingering in the queue you                                 know just adding search to the content                                 listing for example that's been in there                                 for like two or three years and there's                                 just no one to execute appointment so                                 just answer your question yeah thanks                                 first of all congrats to the graduation                                 take it and also I believe I'm myself                                 mostly site builder and that's big                                 enough task than having turned and also                                 to have time to learn to code so                                 basically I don't have the time to                                 become the skilled developer I need to                                 be able to contribute modules and                                 improvement myself but I think we have                                 also like a language barrier between us                                 to work in the UI and those who work in                                 code and we need to some way or other                                 find a way to better communicate between                                 us and we can transfer the experience we                                 gathered over the years our site                                 builders and the knowledge we have from                                 talking to clients on what they need in                                 the editorial you eyes and what we need                                 then to be able to configure and create                                 those features on the sides and more                                 ways of teaming up with developers so                                 it's it's a difficult thing but I don't                                 think communication is necessary a very                                 big challenge if we as UX designers at                                 least communicate our proposals very                                 well very thoroughly we've learned that                                 over the years whenever we have a design                                 proposal that's very timid in terms of                                 its scope and in in terms of its                                 argumentation that we scare developers                                 away because we view we haven't really                                 thought it through much so so we always                                 try to to do our research part and to                                 really put out a very thorough and very                                 complete proposal and and i think that's                                 that's the way right now at least it's                                 it works better if if there's a language                                 barrier there i think there is a                                 perceived language barrier but that's                                 taken away by writing very full                                 proposals being very complete in the                                 design that you suggest okay and follow                                 up I took a guest took a look at the UI                                 dash standards document and it's quite                                 sparse and what I would like to see in                                 there it is also like examples                                 recommendations for module developers on                                 when to use permissions when global                                 configurations who abused and and those                                 kind of things and yeah I think I think                                 the US you I standards as we have them                                 now are they're very basic so they dairy                                 they're not guiding the developer der                                 just saying how to apply a specific                                 pattern so it's yeah it's not ideal yeah                                 we I think we can complement much more                                 if we figure out what the steps are you                                 know every developer takes in deciding                                 you know what UI element to use all                                 right other questions                                 hmm well so I think well the developer                                 case is obviously that their clients in                                 the upcoming years are going to be able                                 to use a more usable tube                                                I think that's the primary use case in                                 terms of well community like exposure                                 and maybe in that sense business                                 exposure I think spark is a great                                 example I mean it got aqua a lot of kind                                 of exposure that they were trying to                                 tackle this very difficult thing in                                 Drupal so as other companies come in I                                 hope they can get that same kind of                                 exposure just by showing they want to                                 contribute really cool stuff I can add a                                 few business cases for companies who                                 would like to contribute to you x one of                                 them is less service questions perhaps                                 even less training less time in                                 customizing their own UX sorry                                 customizing their own administration                                 from my point of view if they do a                                 professional job they do and they don't                                 use the standard core administration                                 because it doesn't scale too realistic                                 sizes yeah there's a few a few things                                 from my experience as a trainer and                                 being very close really related to end                                 users yeah I think especially on that                                 second point of of the administered                                 screens I think before drupal                                            lot of like custom themes companies                                 building their own admin shift team now                                 that seven is out with the                                             whole lot less of that because people                                 feel seven is a good standard and we can                                 maybe expand on that rather than having                                 to completely invent their own yep I                                 think you had a question oh yeah                                 previous one many sites you have                                 sometimes I'm afraid that those focus on                                 a simple side and then you get like                                    more menu items on that it breaks your                                 fields now we have our solutions                                 you                                 and then you have some flexibility that                                 this is just to suggest                                 right so I mean we always try to design                                 for the eighty percent I mean as you are                                 saying that's like the common practice                                 and I think we explicitly try not to                                 design for the extreme cases because                                 it's a very resource-intensive to to do                                 that you have to do a lot of research to                                 figure out if we have no from hum-                                     from hundred items to                                                   a whole lot of different things that you                                 can do to make it more usable and that's                                 where we think that's pretty much that                                 the space where Kumtor has to come in                                 and something we don't have to research                                 it for to design but also we don't want                                 to design for because then it makes the                                 other eighty percent less focused so                                 it's it's a trade-off yeah it's right                                 right right as I mean we trust on the                                 development community to implement it in                                 such a way that it can always be                                 extended yeah okay last question sure                                 too it's both it's stuck in design in                                 terms if we don't know how we're going                                 to group things all the other stuff                                 we've kind of figured out but we don't                                 know how we're going to logically group                                 stuff so it might be that we are not                                 going to solve that in terms of the                                 implementation well Jen Lampton can                                 probably tell you more about this but we                                 have one row and this is is an                                 accessibility issue because well                                 collapsing roles in tables isn't very                                 common so so there's few accessibility                                 issues and how to make that happen so                                 that's I guess an implementation blocker                                 all right that was it all right
