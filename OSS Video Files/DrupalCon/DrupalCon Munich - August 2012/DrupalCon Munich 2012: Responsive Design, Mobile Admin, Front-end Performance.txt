Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Responsive Design, Mobile Admin, Front-end Performance
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	By 2015, there will be more mobile device users then desktop users. That's squarely in the middle of Drupal 8's life cycle. If we want Drupal to remain relevant as a web-based CMS, we must implement significant mobile-friendly features.

We already have Web Services (read: APIs needed for mobile apps) and HTML5 initiatives to work on those parts of the mobile experience. The Mobile Initiative already works closely with those initiatives, but additionally it is focused on the following issues:

Ensuring all our themes use a mobile-first, responsive design
Building a responsive layout engine with the SCOTCH initiative
Front-end performance improvements, including a responsive image solution
Mobile-accessible administrative interface
In this session, we'll discuss what's left to do and how you can help. We'll be having a code sprint to work on the Mobile Initiative issues on the final day of Drupalcon. (And possibly one beforehand, too!)
