Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: Responsive Design, Mobile Admin, Front-end Performance
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	By 2015, there will be more mobile device users then desktop users. That's squarely in the middle of Drupal 8's life cycle. If we want Drupal to remain relevant as a web-based CMS, we must implement significant mobile-friendly features.

We already have Web Services (read: APIs needed for mobile apps) and HTML5 initiatives to work on those parts of the mobile experience. The Mobile Initiative already works closely with those initiatives, but additionally it is focused on the following issues:

Ensuring all our themes use a mobile-first, responsive design
Building a responsive layout engine with the SCOTCH initiative
Front-end performance improvements, including a responsive image solution
Mobile-accessible administrative interface
In this session, we'll discuss what's left to do and how you can help. We'll be having a code sprint to work on the Mobile Initiative issues on the final day of Drupalcon. (And possibly one beforehand, too!)

that I'm not                               gonna be saying welcome in german I'm                               John Albin Wilkins I'm the Drupal                                 mobile initiative lead which means that                               i do a lot less coding that I did during                               the Drupal                                                             look at the big picture try to come up                                with plans with the community and going                                to get those vetted trying to get all                                that stuff sort of planned out and sort                                of push and motivated people that's my                                primary job I'm not the guy who                                implements mobile stuff in Drupal                                       wanted to step back just from the the                                actual sort of goals listed goals with                                the mobile initiative and the work that                                we have to do still and talk about the                                big picture because I really feel like                                mobile is a it's a really really                                sensitive subject when it comes to                                Drupal and the reason of course for this                                is disruptive technologies there have                                been many disruptive technologies in our                                history printing press was a disruptive                                technology the web of course was                                disruptive it caused a lot of little the                                newspaper industry is completely                                foundering because it's not able to                                adapt to the web mobile is sort of the                                new disruptive technology and it is                                already killing markets there are a lot                                of phone manufacturers were like yeah                                we're top of the world and they didn't                                see this sort of smartphone emergence of                                having so basically mobile computers in                                your pocket instead of mobile phones and                                be it it's causing all sorts of                                disruptions and it's actually more of a                                sort of mass extinction this thing has                                such potential to change the way that we                                live our lives that it can easily just                                squash Drupal like a bug and not even                                notice it I mean there's a real                                technology that if Drupal                                doesn't adapt to the ways that people                                are going to use mobile technologies                                that jewel will just not make sense to                                use anymore so that's why I think it's                                really really important that we remind                                ourselves that how important this is and                                to actually start working and make sure                                that this work actually happens because                                it really really matters I've talked                                about this a few times before i'm going                                to go over this real briefly there's                                basically five ways to build a mobile                                solution than I've been able to figure                                out you can have your sort of native                                apps of course which is you know code                                compile to run natively on iPhones and                                androids there are web applications                                which are basically is a website and                                then just sort of your browsing that the                                website application you know in your                                mobile browser then there's this mobile                                desktop domain switching where you when                                you're on a desktop browser you see the                                desktop site and when you're on a mobile                                browser it sort of redirects you                                automatically to a separate domain name                                that has the mobile site then of course                                is new responsive design which has a                                single HTML source and it just sort of                                adapt based using media queries to the                                different sized viewports different                                sized screens and then finally there's a                                rest this is a term that Luke Wroblewski                                it was one of the keynote speakers that                                double con Denver and by the way his                                video is awesome from that that keynote                                we haven't seen ago see it he talks                                about responsive design plus server-side                                components and this is sort of basically                                sort of light clients our site light                                device detection in order to tweak the                                mark up before it gets sent to the the                                end browser right and we don't have to                                have the ability to do all five of these                                things in Drupal core that doesn't make                                sense but we need to make sure that                                Drupal core allows us to do any of these                                five ways of creating a mobile solution                                because there's no one right way for any                                particular use case right it's going to                                be one of these but we can't say that                                responsive design is the solution                                you should always use it's just not that                                 way so given that these are the things                                 that we need to support in Drupal core                                 what's actually going to make Drupal                                 awesome for mobile Drupal                                             the future freezes in December the                                 actual release tentatively is next                                 August that's actually quite a ways away                                 because it cuz after august there's this                                 whole like year of people sort of                                 building up contraband knowledge base                                 and figuring out how to use Drupal                                      it's going to be almost two years from                                 now before we're using Drupal                                           time for building sites that's a long                                 ways off when you're talking about                                 mobile solutions right because people                                 need them right now so even for Drupal                                   is released how can we make dribble                                 awesome and one of the goals that I set                                 out right at the beginning and                                 initiative was that we should have                                 basically a Drupal                                                  documentation that exists on drupal.org                                 that talks about all of the different                                 Drupal                                                                  solutions possible and this of course                                 gives us a sort of better time to market                                 if you will like we can start showing                                 people how awesome Drupal is right now                                 and it also helps us figuring out how                                 are people using Drupal right now and                                 how can we leverage that to make what                                 goes into Drupal                                                     happy with the like a whole bunch of                                 help because all I did was like an                                 outline and everybody filled it in it's                                 one hundred percent done it's on                                 drupal.org / documentation touch mobile                                 this is resources available today of                                 course all the documentation on                                 drupal.org is you know organic there's                                 certainly lots of things that we haven't                                 got because I'm trying to promote this                                 so that more people can add their stuff                                 their solutions to this guide so I                                 encourage you to go look there find out                                 new things and if you know some stuff go                                 and put it in there this would be great                                 this would be a great resource for us so                                 that's one of the goals the Drupal                                   mobile initiative and I want to look at                                 the rest of them excuse me too much                                 yelling like a Morton last night so                                 these are basically the five points that                                 I think are important to be in Drupal                                   core in order for us to have like sort                                 of a a moniker of like drupal being                                 really awesome for for mobile right web                                 services of course web services as part                                 of the whiskey initiative how many                                 people who went to Larry session this                                 morning talking about it okay so I was                                 trying to do some slides so I didn't                                 actually go to see it so you probably                                 know more about that than I do from what                                 I understand though is basically it's                                    they haven't got to it they've done a                                 lot of the plumbing for basically all                                 the necessary components are there to                                 allow a contribute to be really great                                 for web services but he doesn't have the                                 resources he doesn't have the people to                                 actually go and do the work to actually                                 get this to be under percent in core                                 which would be quite nice so if that's                                 something that you think is really                                 important I really encourage you to go                                 talk to Larry because you really needs                                 bodies he needs people to work on the                                 stuff the there's this sort of the under                                 a lot of the underlying plumbing is done                                 I just need to actually just go and                                 implement it okay responsive design this                                 basically like ninety-five percent done                                 right now stark has been converted                                 bartek has been converted there are a                                 couple of fixed width rules in seven                                 that I don't even know why they're in                                 there and I think there's a patch there                                 and they're just waiting for maybe a                                 reroll or a review or it's really close                                 to being done I think that if you are                                 really into responsive design go and                                 check out Bartok you might see some                                 things that you would would like to                                 improve i looked at the naval navigation                                 it's it works but others some sort of                                 newer navigation techniques and maybe                                 you want to try out I'm certainly                                 willing to look at those kind of patches                                 so if you want to improve that go for it                                 right these skills of course are there                                 they're kind of all over the map this is                                 kind of a weird initiative in that it                                 has all these different components that                                 are despaired they're not really similar                                 to each other so we end up with a big                                 diverse skill set so if this is your                                 skill set you know there's still some                                 stuff to do in their front end                                 performance I would say this about ten                                 percent done there's a lot of different                                 parts in this as well we have JavaScript                                 and nod is easy in here they're here he                                 gave a javascript talk earlier today yes                                 yesterday where he talked about the                                 goals that we've been discussing within                                 the community to try and make JavaScript                                 better experience for all drupal                                 developers and of course this is a you                                 know improving how we use javascript is                                 going to have a big impact on you know                                 mobile experience of course java script                                 runs kind of slowly on mobile devices                                 and if we can make that JavaScript a lot                                 leaner load only when it needs to be                                 loaded those are the things that we need                                 to have help with and get that kind of                                 stuff implemented and then we also have                                 CSS stuff there's been a lot of work                                 inside a CSS stuff morton's done a bunch                                 of stuff as far as cleaning it up trying                                 to make it more organized and one of the                                 things that I discovered just in the                                 past two weeks as I started reading                                 about smacks and how many people here                                 know about smacks is scalable and                                 modular architecture CSS just a couple                                 people snook Jonathan snook or Snuka on                                 like Twitter and wherever he describes                                 it smokes maxcom he describes a                                 technique for both sort of organizing                                 and categorizing your style sheets that                                 it becomes much easier to figure out                                 okay i'm adding this rule how should it                                 be organized with the other style sheets                                 i really really like this method i would                                 like to build sort of consensus to see                                 if this is something we want to use in                                 core i think it is but i'm not the                                 community right so I want to make sure                                 that everybody                                 on the same page and then we start doing                                 this because I really feel that is good                                 the other half of smacks is not just the                                 the organization for the actual class                                 name how you name your classes and you                                 need to write that in sort of modular                                 weights maxcom if you don't know it                                 talks about this sort of naming                                 convention for your class names those                                 things two together make basically give                                 you a set of rules so you can use tools                                 like CSS lint to look through Drupal                                 kors style sheets and try to correct                                 them using this max rules I think it's a                                 really good combo and I would like to                                 see people start jumping on that one of                                 the things that we want to do is make                                 the JavaScript and CSS aggregation                                 pluggable the the JavaScript people                                 actually understand why this is more                                 important than I do but one of the                                 things we started looking at is the                                 aesthetic library this is a symphony                                 component that is something that I                                 should have stopped it should be                                 discussing this with everybody rather                                 than just sort of lecturing um let me                                 step back here just for a second rather                                 than discussing aesthetic let's talk                                 about JavaScript so what kind of things                                 you guys want to talk about is where is                                 JavaScript how many people went to tune                                 on session yesterday okay excellent so                                 do you guys have questions concerns what                                 do you understand better about                                 javascript inside the mobile initiative                                 because sorry                                 whether or not we're using jQuery itself                                 so right now in Drupal                                                   like basically no matter what even if                                 you don't use it which is kind of crazy                                 so has that patch been committed that at                                 least removes the almost right yeah yeah                                 yeah okay so we're almost have the point                                 where you can we are switching all of                                 coors usage of drupal add js                                             add library and that basically allows us                                 to find the dependencies for javascript                                 file so you say yes I need jquery or yes                                 I need Drupal settings whatever and and                                 then those dependencies get loaded                                 depending on I think we shouldn't sort                                 of encourage that pattern in katra but                                 Drupal add j/s will not go away if you                                 use Drupal adjaye guess it will assume                                 jquery as a dependency was then we'll                                 wait again that's what we discussed                                 other questions about JavaScript I tried                                 nod I've been really really hard finding                                 people who are passionate about                                 javascript but there's certainly a lot                                 of opportunity to really shine in Syria                                 if you want to show off some JavaScript                                 skills                                 hmm                                 so the question was ignoring JavaScript                                 out aggregation and and forget the other                                 one thing but bandwidth what are the                                 major sort of pain points for JavaScript                                 runtime um I'm not actually sure maybe                                 just jquery in general it's a large                                 library for when you want to do like one                                 simple thing Jake like sometimes jquery                                 justice is way too much code for the one                                 simple thing so there's some                                 simplification that we can do in in some                                 of our core scripts that contributor you                                 know leverage or they can continue using                                 jQuery yeah the the sort of the minute                                 this is true of you know any computer                                 language the sort of closer you are to                                 the to the actual sort of the bone you                                 know the the the root source the faster                                 this stuff goes so when you add                                 abstraction layers it always has to be                                 slower right so mobile performance is is                                 painful enough that if there are some                                 sort of little tweaks that we can do                                 where we have like a one-line jquery                                 script didn't change that two maybe                                 three lines of really fast JavaScript                                 that can be a win for core and maybe                                 those patterns and can be sort of                                 proliferate into into good rib that way                                 jquery is great i mean especially when                                 you're doing like a lot of complicated                                 stuff cakery can be really really great                                 but it's not for absolutely everything                                 yeah we can talk about some act right                                 now                                 aibelin was was their free documentation                                 for this smacks and I believe there are                                 parts of the book that are available for                                 free and then the parts of it that are                                 sort of premium content so i'm pretty                                 sure that the base category or                                 categories and stuff are free because                                 that's how i initially read it and then                                 and then I wouldn't bought the book                                 because I wanted to read the whole thing                                 but I'm i think the there's there's free                                 stuff available on smacks com to read                                 sorry j.crew Oh touching on Jake I'm                                 repeating it for the video i guess the                                 touch again jquery bandwidth is there                                 any plans to use jquery mobile jquery                                 mobile is a is a library for those                                 people who don't know it allow you to                                 sort of build interfaces using the                                 jquery mobile library for mobile devices                                 and we don't really have a good use case                                 for that in core so we don't have any                                 plans to use it it's you know contribute                                 be no reason why we can't some support                                 that as a contribute but when we talk                                 about mobile administration of here                                 actually I context it could talk about                                 that now too now go back to that mobile                                 administration so because it was about                                 ten percent done basically we want to                                 make sure people are using their phones                                 in all sorts of different ways and if                                 they want to like tweak the                                 administration of their site using their                                 phone I want to do that quite often                                 actually or make maybe like write a                                 draft blog post while I'm standing in                                 line I want to do that so having the                                 ability to use you know most of the                                 administrative functionality of Drupal                                 in a mobile device I think it would be                                 really really useful in really essential                                 really                                                                appearances right when you first install                                 dribbling just sort of look at your                                 blade and go does this work at my phone                                 and then you pull it up you're like wow                                 okay yeah okay drew believe the                                 ministration favor works on my iPhone                                 this is great so like it's very good                                 first impression but it's also extremely                                 useful yeah I'll go back to that so Vlad                                 too far                                 and then I lost the thread was the                                 question no jquery mobile so mobile                                 administration the way that we're going                                 to do this is is by making the the forms                                 sort of be responsive                                                fluid layout so there's like I said                                 there's a couple rules that for some                                 reason have fixed with it but you know                                 we fixed that make the the sort of forms                                 be responsive it and it will sort of                                 you'll be able to administrate it on                                 also two different sized screens because                                 we're like you know with seven we're                                 kind of already we're already like                                 halfway there because the theme already                                 supports fluid it's just that there's                                 some forms like I love vertical tabs on                                 the desktop vertical apps don't work in                                 all my mobile device because all you see                                 are the tabs and then you have to scroll                                 over to see the rest of the stuff so                                 there are some different sort of form                                 wedges of use and patterns that we use                                 in in Drupal                                                          and we just need to tweak those so that                                 they you know they're vertical tabs for                                 large screens and they are some sort of                                 different interface for smaller screens                                 I really need to not press a button like                                 five times okay                                 um more questions about snacks or                                 JavaScript or or aesthetic Alex and so                                 oh this supposed to be a button right                                 there underfunded performance yes                                 responsive images uh yeah um i would                                 consider that i'm kind of considered                                 that affording performance it's                                 certainly related responsive design but                                 the reason why it's a front as                                 performers concern of course is because                                 the default is have a giant image and                                 just scale it down to a little DVD                                 screen this is a horrible performance                                 and it's definitely in this sort of                                 square you know it's definitely under                                 this sort of front end performance                                 seconds I can't believe I forgot a                                 bullet damn it what was it                                 well yes so there there isn't really                                 there's no standard there's no standard                                 for responsive images there's literally                                 no html                                                                 can't and it turns out that this is a                                 really hard problem I've been working                                 with the sort of greater web community                                 in talking about this and sort of                                 hashing it out and we basically                                 discovered that there's no JavaScript                                 way to fix this problem and the reason                                 for this it's not necessarily intuitive                                 because it's a total browser internal                                 things they do this thing called                                 prefetching of images where before they                                 build up the dom they're like i'm going                                 to look through this HTML source really                                 fast and find the image tags and then                                 i'll start download those immediately                                 right so it starts downloading the                                 images before it even starts building up                                 the Dom this is the sort of pre parser                                 that fetches stuff and that means that                                 there literally is no way that the                                 JavaScript can run first before that the                                 only way you could do it is by removing                                 the image tag from the source but of                                 course now you have a problem because                                 there are some noble devices that don't                                 have javascript or there are some users                                 who turn off JavaScript and you've lost                                 all of your images that's not an                                 acceptable solution right so we have to                                 have like basically a the only way to                                 like halfway do it right now is to use a                                 javascript solution paired with a sort                                 of default image which is the mobile                                 size so it's a small size that's                                 actually in the HTML source and then                                 basically you use javascript to                                 determine what the viewport width is and                                 then load up those larger images for the                                 larger screen size yes that's a double                                 image load for larger image sizes that's                                 a problem but that's the only way to do                                 it right now which totally sucks which                                 means that we definitely need to have an                                 actual like new technology in HTML that                                 allows us to do this because the                                 browser's do know how big the viewport                                 is before it starts prefetching so we're                                 working with the spec builders to write                                 a spec so that the browser's can                                 can look at the viewport size real fast                                 before does a prefetching and then when                                 it finds that image tag or whatever is                                 that the new like picture element right                                 it finds that and then it knows based on                                 the view port which actual source of the                                 ones that are available to download so                                 that's the only way that it will                                 actually be fixed is with a new sort of                                 element or new attribute on the image                                 tag and working through that stuff and                                 just last week we talked with Matt will                                 tell who's been writing the actual sort                                 of draft back for this and Jesse Beach                                 started up a google hangout where we                                 talked about these issues and how Drupal                                 can actually sort of implement a                                 JavaScript polyfill that sort of                                 forward-looking basically we would we                                 would try to create the mark-up that we                                 think is going to be used inside Drupal                                 core and this is a rough idea we need                                 input we would implement the the mark-up                                 that we think is going to become the                                 spec we would implement a JavaScript                                 solution that would do what exactly what                                 I just talked about that is a sort of                                 polyfill for all the browsers that don't                                 have the native solution which is every                                 browser right now but when we get to                                 that spot where browsers know about they                                 have actual native implementations you                                 know like IE or chrome or whatever                                 implements this then our javascript                                 solution goes oh it's already taken care                                 of i'm not going to do anything right so                                 we wanted to be sort of forward                                 compatible and i think a mat mat will                                 tow was really interested in in drupal                                 actually sort of testing out and seeing                                 how this actually works in today's web                                 technologies right now he's very                                 interested in the work we're doing so                                 yeah there's no html                                                  this and that's what we're trying to                                 work on and if you're really interested                                 in that on Friday you know all the                                 initiatives are having this code sprint                                 this says on the schedule where that                                 room is going to be I encourage you to                                 come and and discuss stuff and of course                                 we're going to have issues there's an                                 issue already in the issue queue if                                 you're not going to be here                                 friday and i have a regular mobile                                 initiative in its right I have regular                                 mobile initiative meetings online we've                                 been starting to doing Google Hangouts                                 so that's how you can straight continue                                 to be involved with stuff yeah go ahead                                 mm-hmm right so the the the actual sort                                 of right now it's a picture element that                                 is being proposed as a solution along                                 with a source set attribute because                                 there are a lot of sort of there are a                                 lot of people who want responsive images                                 but they want them in slightly different                                 ways like some people just want to just                                 support retina displays right and some                                 people just want to have the ability to                                 sort of editorially decide that for                                 small screens we're going to show like                                 somebody's head shot right and then on                                 larger screens will show them in the                                 context of like the the hall where                                 they're speaking right so editorial                                 control over the different croppings                                 right because of those different                                 interests it's a complicated sort of                                 solution and picture is the sort of                                 element with source set attribute it's                                 which is similar to the video tag that's                                 the sort of the the current spec and the                                 filament group which matt will tow works                                 for I believe he they have a polyfill a                                 JavaScript polyfill called picture Phil                                 is there a picture film that's actually                                 the the the JavaScript library that                                 we're looking at right now in Drupal                                   core                                 right so so the the the note was                                 basically that there's some quote                                 unquote interesting UX work going on in                                 in the issue queue right now talking                                 about how you configure break points and                                 actually configure the style sheets                                 we're definitely at a sort of beginning                                 to hash things out phase right now we                                 actually had a follow-up conversation to                                 that last initial issue queue posting on                                 monday i believe it was we had we had                                 annex we had Alex Brownstein written not                                 not there in motion and Jesse beach and                                 think a few other people and we just                                 started talking about the UX and and                                 there's that conversation is definitely                                 going to continue on Friday or anytime                                 you want to like just come and find me                                 during the during the conference i'll be                                 happy to continuing that conversation                                 because there is a lot of ux work to                                 make it as as simple as possible you                                 know because there are a lot of moving                                 parts right because if you have a layout                                 you basically have a series of break                                 points for that layout but you can also                                 have multiple layouts on your site like                                 one for each node type so then there's a                                 different series of break points for                                 those different layouts so it can get a                                 little mind-bending really quickly so                                 definitely want to have the UX as simple                                 as possible so people can understand it                                 hopefully                                 ok                                 okay so what you're talking about is                                 like moving moving an element to a                                 different part of the page for different                                 for a different break points or right                                 but but those are different                                 configurations because I mean you're                                 talking about how you're configuring                                 this the one image as a field on like                                 the node page and the other you're                                 talking about the you know in the view                                 or that's a block right it's a different                                 configuration so we don't need to it                                 just sort of the interfaces basis or to                                 naturally take care of that any other                                 questions about front end performance                                 which is these three things bless                                 responsive images which i'm a dumbass                                 for not putting on there more questions                                 okay so let's move on to html                                       element this basically eighty percent                                 done jason has had to step down from                                 being the html                                                      basically just you know she's she she                                 wants to work on other stuff and you                                 know the html                                                         work was a lot of work for her so they                                 got a ton of stuff done but one of the                                 things that's not quite done is the                                 html                                                                  actually have like inform API we have                                 all the html                                                             is that we don't have those same form                                 elements as widgets for fields right and                                 that is kind of a big problem for mobile                                 because if we can't create a like an                                 email field widget for this text fields                                 then the user is not going to get the                                 special email keyboard right because                                 it's not using the email input element                                 right is it type emails and what it is                                 yeah type type equals an email right so                                 those things would be like kind of                                 a jarring for the user experience                                 because they're expecting the HTML of                                 sort of flashiness and it's just not in                                 Drupal                                                                 help out with that we have some patches                                 for some of this stuff and the stuff                                 that doesn't have patches can you                                 basically look at the other issues and                                 sort of replicate that same pattern I                                 Dave's worked on Dave Reed has worked on                                 a bunch of that stuff and I talked to                                 him on Monday and said like hey do this                                 so thanks David but we need more people                                 to work on self it's not just Dave cos                                 gonna do it easy you know implemented                                 the pattern and now you have to go and                                 replicate the pattern please so are                                 there questions about through the html                                  initiative in general or uniform                                 elements of specific yeah so so the                                 question is does anybody get to take                                 over the html                                                            just finished and it is the way the way                                 that Jason set up the the scope and the                                 goals of the html                                                  really close to being done right so it                                 doesn't make a whole lot of sense for us                                 at this point to in my opinion and I'm                                 obviously i don't have the hair i'm not                                 drees but it's a little bit too late too                                 close to the end goal here to have it                                 like a new initiative lead and and try                                 to look at the whole thing again and                                 maybe figure out some new goals and                                 there's a lot of html                                                   there's certainly the opportunity to                                 like look at all the html                                                need that fork or two we've got a lot of                                 other initiatives that need help already                                 so like starting up a basically sort of                                 revived HTML initiative part to it we                                 have a resourcing issue already so we                                 don't want to drain some of those                                 resources by starting off the new stuff                                 but we do need people to finish off                                 what's already in the html                                             I'm actually going to be leading the                                 html                                                                 well as the mobile initiative sprint                                 and I'm just just doing that because I                                 know that there are people in who were                                 working on the html                                                  we're just kind of waiting for jinxing                                 to hold another meeting and and I really                                 think that you can sort of self self                                 organize and finish up this stuff and                                 I'm just going to get us sort of get the                                 ball rolling and have maybe I'll even                                 have a an html                                                          in the next couple weeks and again                                 looking for sort of self organizers to                                 keep that moving yeah so the one thing I                                 would say is there's a lot of things                                 that are sort of part of HTML a larger                                 html                                                                   the assumption is that they could                                 probably live okay and contribute ads in                                 court our fields you know we don't have                                 like geolocation stuff we don't have                                 stopped having to do with WebSockets so                                 there's definitely a lot of things that                                 sort of follow on to fall under the                                 html                                                                    can be contribs Aleutians but if anyone                                 here you know knows html                                              and like looks digs into what actually                                 is in core and sees that like oh my god                                 we are actually missing something that                                 really does need to be in core yeah and                                 that can't work well as contribute that                                 yeah because in the absence of having                                 jaysene monitoring that you know we need                                 we need that information yeah that's                                 true yeah jubilation should be able to                                 support anything that's in html                                         we've missing some of the plumbing that                                 allows that full range of capabilities                                 we need to know that now and we need to                                 get it in to cook or so do you are                                 playing around with that stuff and you                                 know how the pain points aren't Drupal                                   get into the issue queue find people                                 come talk to me you know we need to know                                 any other questions about html                                  mobile administration I talked about                                 this briefly when we're talking about                                 jQuery Mobile but one of the besides                                 sort of making all the administrative                                 forms be responsive one of the                                 interesting things that have come out                                 here in the last two weeks is of course                                 the spark responsive layout builder this                                 is a very slick layout builder Chris                                 Vander water and I have been talking for                                 months about the blocks and layouts                                 initiative where we were talking                                 conceptually about that initiative is                                 going to have a layout builder right and                                 I'm like I would love it to be                                 responsive and when you get to that spot                                 in your initiative I'm going to help out                                 coding that stuff because I think it's                                 really really important and really                                 interesting those are one of the sort of                                 the cross-pollination between the                                 initiatives things that happens because                                 a lot of these initiatives are very                                 close to related whiskey has web                                 services for example right so we've been                                 talking about that for months and then                                 the Aqua team did this spark demo in d                                   how many people here haven't seen the                                 demo yet there's very few people that's                                 great actually that means a lot of                                 people saw it there I was what's the                                 most recent like blog post and video                                 that you can find for the demo is it is                                 andre's a site or it yeah go to the Aqua                                 booth you're here go to the Aqua Kapoor                                 have them demoed it for you all right                                 yeah so oh that's true yeah yeah so                                 there was a demo of it yesterday so that                                 video is actually already online so you                                 know when right before you go and drink                                 tonight watch the video it's it's really                                 cool I think it's it looks at sort of                                 the current way that we build response                                 to designs and and the Dom order that                                 you sort of have to have in order to do                                 different layouts techniques and really                                 brings all those sort of concepts                                 together in an interface that is is                                 really slick they are not the people who                                 are going to do this for Drupal                                        are certainly do                                 you know a bunch of it but they're                                 looking for Community Support Community                                 help to actually implement it basically                                 take the pieces that are there and                                 moving into Drupal                                                      up I'm going to quote gap over here who                                 doesn't mind you basically told me the                                 interface is really slick in the the                                 markup and the CSS that it generates                                 because it's a rough demo are complete                                 crap I'm actually paraphrasing but but                                 there's you know there I've looked at                                 the way they sort of architected and I                                 understand that there's basically a spot                                 where they after you've done sort of the                                 UI stuff they generate this yes and they                                 generate the HTML and there's a big                                 opportunity for somebody to come in and                                 say I want to make that lean and look                                 awesome and be really slick and you can                                 come in and do that work and so that is                                 a good opportunity and the cursor o are                                 lots of other places that's the one that                                 sort of jumps out of me the generating                                 the HTML and CSS that's kind of sub I                                 like but maybe you would look more                                 interested in some of the other bits and                                 spark inside the inside builder or the                                 other parts of spark that aren't the                                 responsive layout builder the questions                                 about mobile administration or                                 responsive layout building right now                                 yeah                                 do I have any thoughts about                                            high editor um in mobile uh not yet I                                 don't have any thoughts about Aloha yet                                 I saw the demo yesterday and I thought                                 my wonderful it works in a mobile editor                                 and then like which is I forgot to ask                                 the question because we were talking                                 about all sorts of different really cool                                 things and accessibility and stuff like                                 that so I do people know I like does                                 loja work in mobile devices okay okay so                                 so when leaders here's one of the people                                 working on in this park in the low high                                 editor says that i'm repeating for the                                 video and that it it works ok ish and                                 mobile devices and working and improving                                 it there's a blog post on dresses a                                 website about this as well other                                 questions about the the mobile                                 administration there's a lot of sort of                                 patterns in our forms interfaces that we                                 use that I think need some some sort of                                 UX love as far as making it a mobile                                 pattern and desktop pattern sort of you                                 know responsive experience in the                                 background like give you next sorry                                 you                                 right so Luis diamond did a lot of                                 iterations of the eight mobile                                 administrative interface specifically                                 the navigation and we did a lot of that                                 iterative design work and there weren't                                 a whole lot of people jumping getting oh                                 I want to implement this and then spark                                 came along and they have a they've taken                                 some of those ideas and come up with a                                 dashboard and sort of simplified                                 administrative interfaces for navigation                                 which I think build really nicely on                                 what Louis was working on and it makes                                 it even better so I would like to see                                 people make the spark mobile                                 administration be even better and then                                 use that for triple core and I know that                                 that the spark team would also like that                                 as well so yeah again if you haven't                                 seen that that's part of the spark demo                                 if you haven't seen it go and take a                                 look in the back                                 so at so I asked this sort of maybe                                 unrelated question that about how do I                                 see the future of jQuery UI in core to                                 be honest I'm not really sure I don't                                 actually know the answer then I mean                                 there's a lot of moving parts of the                                 mobile initiative and I try to know a                                 lot about all the different parts but                                 that's one of them that I don't know as                                 much about so I try to find people to                                 help me out and answer those questions                                 for me anybody have an answer or their                                 opinion not like the answer but a                                 opinion about is                                 yeah so it's it sounds like we're                                 starting to use UI in core and some of                                 the things so OA this this bark team was                                 using UI for parts of it weren't they                                 jquery UI or am i okay so a low higher                                 uses jQuery UI                                 oh yes oh yeah so the question was are                                 we planning on supporting every single                                 administrator screen in mobile because                                 we're getting views in core and and I                                 that is a fantastic question and I would                                 love to see one hundred percent coverage                                 really and there are some things you                                 just can't do on a mobile device like                                 literally the forum which don't work on                                 mobile device like I can't help load an                                 image from my phone it's just not                                 possible and okay so right and it                                 monthly were able to do it there are                                 limitations inherit to the to mobile                                 devices don't allow me to do everything                                 that you can under the desktop device                                 but I would like to see everything that                                 is potentially possible to be able to be                                 done in a mobile device but the reality                                 is that with the sort of small form                                 factor people are sort of naturally not                                 gonna do those things very often like                                 you know configuring panels and a mobile                                 device not such a good idea i would                                 think yeah so but the the screens that i                                 would like to start working on first our                                 content administration when I might say                                 content administration I mean content                                 creation and not only just nodes but                                 like you know taxonomy or users you know                                 administrating those nodes noticing                                 users well I would have about to say                                 things are entities but energies are                                 starting to go all over the place where                                 I'm not sure and makes sense to                                 administer those things blacks will be                                 at ease now kinds of creative like users                                 and nodes in particular I would like to                                 see those things worked on first                                 any other questions about anything else                                 here orden like maybe gaps to big data                                 tables in the administrative area yeah                                 that's actually one of the patches that                                 motion Jesse Beach worked on a monday                                 and i think they hadn't quite finished                                 it so it didn't get submitted yet                                 hopefully that latest patch will come up                                 on friday and we were working on using a                                 one of the ideas from filament group as                                 far as like as you become smaller screen                                 basically hide the less important for                                 columns so that when you're on a smaller                                 screen you see the important ones the                                 essential ones and as you get bigger                                 than the slightly more useful ones and                                 then just like everything when you get                                 to a wider screen and there'll be a sort                                 of link above the table that says just                                 show me anything everything anyway and                                 it'll just it'll go off the edge of your                                 mobile screen but you can scroll over                                 and see it then well yeah my mean these                                 are the it would be become part of the                                 the interface for theme table i believe                                 so basically any time you use theme                                 table that would be an option that you                                 could do use so we would just need to                                 the patch i think converts i don't know                                 if it converts all of them all of the                                 uses of theme table but it definitely                                 update the same table and at least one                                 sort of uses as a like like here's an                                 example i haven't like i said i haven't                                 seen the patch because i haven't                                 submitted in friday so we'll find out                                 yeah but we're working on that and other                                 questions                                 so one of the easiest ways to get                                 involved of course is since you're here                                 come talk to me any time you see me I                                  want to I want to talk about this stuff                                  I want to find out what your experiences                                  want to corral you into actually doing                                  some work but if you're and of course on                                  Friday we're having a mobile initiative                                  sprint everybody is welcome and then                                  after the conference this is basically                                  the best resource we're finding out                                  about the the mobile initiative group                                  drupal.org / mobile / / drupal dash                                    and if you get other way your picture                                  here if you go to there and you're going                                  to see this which is the interesting bit                                  here is the issues to work on I've sort                                  of broken out all of those different                                  components into like because you don't                                  want to see like all of mobile                                  initiatives initiative or issues right                                  this is just going to be like a fire                                  hose so I've broken it down by sort of                                  component and you can sort of click down                                  into things that you're interested in                                  and see just those issues we have a list                                  of issues novices can tackle these are                                  not like people that don't know anything                                  about web development but like people                                  who worked you know dabbled in mobile I                                  feel comfortable in different different                                  aspects of it and you know they're                                  basically new to Drupal core work right                                  these are some great issues I think                                  actually we've got patches and somebody                                  was reviewing those patches on Monday                                  and then of course we have JavaScript
