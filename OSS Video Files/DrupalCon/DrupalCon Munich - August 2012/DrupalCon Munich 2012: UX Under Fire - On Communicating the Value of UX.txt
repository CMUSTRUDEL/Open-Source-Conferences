Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: UX Under Fire - On Communicating the Value of UX
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	As a UX professional you've probably found yourself forced to argue for the importance of UX in a project. You've probably heard people say that UX is of little importance. And as a designer it's not always easy to explain why UX matters. But UX needs to be justified. And it's your job to do so. In this session I will present ways to convince even project managers from hell about the value of UX.

Attend this session to learn methods to visualize and communicate the value of UX and usability. Using these tools and frameworks you will be able to convincingly argue for why UX is critical to a website delivering what its stakeholders expect.

SESSION HIGHLIGHTS
The reasons why UX comes under fire, and the many misconceptions that exist regarding UX and usability.
The UX value proposition: How to visually translate the value of UX work.
The link between UX and business: How to talk about UX in terms MBAs can relate to.
A success story: What an incredible difference a few hours spent on UX can do for a website.
* I use the the term UX here as a shortening for the wide field of usability, interaction design (IxD), user experience design and information architecture.

Previously presented at Frontend United in Amsterdam in April of 2012, this session was very appreciated and highly rated.

Roth okay all right we actually made                                a video about the drupalcon traveling to                                Paris five episodes all of the owners                                get into a motor home we drove us calm                                down to Paris we stopped in Copenhagen                                Cologne and ribbon and Paris and we shot                                an episode in education and special was                                about the Rubicon and his mission from                                trees we made rock bands The Killing                                killers here playing live in Copenhagen                                we have the air fresheners the first                                batch didn't smell so good that was                                problem so we had to make it the second                                measure and of course the those are not                                available are both these are old slide                                sorry they're all sold out you know if                                you have one you should be feel lucky                                essentially we're full service agency                                there's something interfering with my                                clicker here right so I felt a good                                starting point for this topic would be                                talked about the myths the things you                                should hear from people that say like oh                                this huge stuff in your in your senior                                in your quote here or whatever it is it                                what is it just it's just it's just                                paint it's just like it's just eye candy                                well I'd like to address some of those                                myths and the reality the first one you                                often hear is that UX is essentially eye                                candy like the real value comes from the                                Cody right in the functionality in and                                that brings you know but to understand                                why you it is not just it's not about I                                can they wait to understand why you                                which was created in the first place so                                before there was you ex are you access a                                lot of these professions come as a                                response from something how many people                                bought tickets using ryanair's website                                anyone have you seen this yeah so                                essentially they want you to buy travel                                insurance but saying no it's not that                                simple you actually have to scroll down                                that list and this is this is black hat                                use about this is basically tricking                                people to buying stuff they don't really                                want so you have to have the plain evil                                UX at the UX anti-patterns and then you                                actually had just a suffragist it's just                                sloppy like the like its elevator in                                spain i'm going to show in a bit this                                one I mean everyone here can count in                                Spanish know that this is this makes no                                sense                                so now I mean we can forgive a small                                hotel somewhere in Spain i found that                                found this one in the web blog called                                bad news about that come have tons of                                these a lot of these fun examples I I                                went to subway sometime this spring and                                I saw this menu and I looked at this                                many of like what are my options and                                then without seeing the other four menus                                I had no idea I was like yeah I can                                either get a sub I can get soda or i can                                get chips or cooking but it turns out                                they're all in the same menu it is there                                are three different menus but you see                                the spacing area they were just pacing                                makes it seem like each thing is it so                                many and anyone who is familiar with                                Gestalt psychology know that there's                                something there are certain patterns to                                 human to human perception if certain                                 things are aligned you believe they're                                 grouped they have some to do with each                                 other if they if they're grouped like                                 they're more the proximate to certain                                 items is sort of higher than others like                                 this sort of visual group you also                                 deduce that they have something to do                                 with each other and then when I'd known                                 the gestalt principles of perception                                 with a known this is bad design so my                                 colleague had explained to me yeah I                                 gotta look the right to see what's                                 included in each money so the happiest                                 even in print the thing with a                                 disability to is that it's expensive                                 that's why I also in the reason why we                                 need expectations and that's a great                                 argument because no one well some people                                 would argue with money but most people                                 they don't ever argue about money money                                 is like many money to the argument that                                 trumps at all so this example is from a                                 kid remembers from it's a pretty good                                 example basically see that take an                                 e-commerce site with the conversion flow                                 a lot of people started and not a lot of                                 people make it through it's like a leaky                                 pipe you know you lose you lose pressure                                 at every joint every poorly designed                                 joint and jakub nielsen they used to                                 build the danishes built a guru he                                 that's pretty this is pretty                                 this is pretty good quote and in fact it                                 said usually you should even more than                                 hundred percent so if you cuz if your                                 customers are in e-commerce bad you                                 would cost them money it custom tons of                                 potential revenue i'm going to show an                                 example here it kind of sort of make                                 that the you know their hair in your                                 next and it's unbelievable alright so i                                 found this example XKCD i thought it was                                 kind of funny yeah it's hard even                                 universities use versus university state                                 supposedly teach you x so the faculty                                 knowledge seldom reaches the IT                                 department                                 alright so if you exist as I can it can                                 we really resolve all these things using                                 iconic if all we did is you expect its                                 nurse was making things look pretty                                 could really solve these problems using                                 as I can it no we can't because we do                                 more than just eye candy because we                                 solve these problems so you extends for                                 user experience they go it consists of                                 understanding the needs and goals of                                 users translating those in the features                                 and requirements designing the                                 interactive flow the interaction to user                                 has with the website its functions and                                 evaluate how the world works and do I                                 turreted improvements you can view the                                 UX profession as an umbrella its                                 umbrella term and in my view and I've                                 you know I've thought a lot about this                                 like like some people say usability some                                 people say UX and a recent years                                 usability a sort of people less less                                 people say you spelt and more say day to                                 work with you x user experience and user                                 experience is supposedly the bigger term                                 so in my understanding this is this is                                 how it works in my mind that you                                 exhibition and the petitioners of you x                                 they are they know interaction design                                 used to build engineering interaction                                 design information architecture and                                 experience design and graphic design so                                 what getting bit more detail what each                                 of these professions do in everything                                 but in your role as New York's                                 professionally you do at least two of                                 these I expect but like I said there's a                                 lot of disagreement here what would you                                 explain so i googled to see what what                                 you know for Venn diagrams Venn diagrams                                 are like i love them they're funny they                                 they are easy to understand so this blog                                 here this guy Patrick marseille or                                 something this is how he views are gonna                                 move                                 this is how evo x and as you can see                                 here there's a lot of technology tie in                                 here this is a very coder centric you                                 expression this one from information                                 architects that JP is way more focused                                 on structure and and of course                                 information architecture and then even                                 based in behave even business to                                 analysis I want that one that's a bit                                 less structured is this one where                                 apparently the user interface designer                                 is a subset of the u                                                which also has a was also working on                                 identity designer apparently doing                                 branding which the which I would expect                                 like a marketing agency today an ad                                 agency mmm finally he's also customer                                 service manager and again here you see                                 this one even ties in sound design in                                 the profession so there's a lot of                                 confusion here so I want to define what                                 is what is your experience what what                                 does it do and why is it important so                                 let's find this these are activities                                 information design taxonomy content                                 structured what we do and rupa mean                                 creatures we create account type screen                                 taxonomies looking at how fields and                                 entities relate to each other that's                                 information architecture used to build                                 engineering its ability what the                                 difference I think between usability and                                 a lot of user experience a whole is a                                 built it's very sort of empirical it's                                 very measurable its use of research you                                 make two versions you can do a be                                 testing as a way to do use the build                                 engineering but you all can also do like                                 you can also observe the user do an                                 observation test ask the user to perform                                 certain task and see how the world I do                                 and tweak and redo in twiki we do it                                 borrows a lot of it's a lot of its                                 methodologies barred from from academics                                 from science interaction design and now                                 this is sort of the the fluffy stuff                                 about what we do                                 when you use a website you look at                                 something interact with it what happens                                 but we're design of those happens                                 between you and the screen you can't                                 touch it and happens in the moment and                                 we design the actual interaction                                 interaction it has it has a bit to do                                 with how you perceive things it has a                                 bit to do with the copied it's used in                                 the site it has a bit to do with the                                 buttons to sign the impression the look                                 and feel and everything but all the                                 taken together will affect how you                                 interact with the system information                                 architecture oh yeah information design                                 I think the sort of overlap a lot but                                 information design is more to I think is                                 it more to do with the big legitimate a                                 structural approach interacts                                 information design is more to how you                                 present information in a way that makes                                 sense to the user experience design when                                 you focus more on the feeling that a                                 system communicates usability usability                                 make sure the system is used what helps                                 you solve a problem can experience a                                 sign it's really important in computer                                 computer games for example or maybe an                                 e-commerce site where you want to commit                                 a certain mood or something because                                 feelings are what self people by using                                 feelings not not a brain actually and                                 the graphic design you know making it                                 feel like there's going to assume a for                                 effort in Italy you like the way it                                 looks alright so how do they relate this                                 here so user experience and usability                                 they are their qualities a system can a                                 great user experience and great                                 usability kind of porous built-in great                                 user experience actually dark their case                                 of that but look at how they related as                                 a whole so what I did I map this in a                                 circle in the center you have the                                 usability goals and there are essential                                 things like efficient to use is to                                 remember how to use is to learn and so                                 on and by fulfilling those you can                                 create a great user experience assistant                                 easy to use will ultimately                                 automatically be enjoyable to use                                 that's how they tie in mmm and even even                                 things are hard to use can actually                                 enjoyable to use games for example like                                 if you play a game you want to challenge                                 you want to you want to master if the                                 game is too easy then it's no fun the                                 best games they actually adjust the                                 difficulty to your level so it never                                 gets too hard or too easy you're always                                 like you reach that moment of low where                                 you know it's used have a perfect right                                 of the perfect amount of you know                                 resistance so this is our toolbox this                                 is toolbox we have which helps us create                                 great usability which results in great                                 user experience and here's another way                                 to look at it this is about how great                                 companies achieve great design most                                 companies they don't make it further                                 than achieving things that are                                 convenient some companies they actually                                 create things that are meaningful to                                 their users and as well no one way you                                 can do this is by great design going to                                 sign us in the greatest science in your                                 macbook for example seeing are you                                 seeing you know and a lot of people they                                 would quote the sinus the reasons why                                 they have mac okay right so do we                                 implement solutions what some of us do                                 some was working small companies where                                 we need to be broad and generic somos a                                 very specialized roles I think it's very                                 much up to what you do but if you know                                 how to implement things I think it helps                                 you in your profession it helps you                                 understand the limitations of the                                 solutions and helps you relate to the                                 program as two people are going to                                 implement it okay myth number two                                 they're going to shovel a job as a                                 shovel regardless of its color the thing                                 you acknowledge and about how it works                                 so I brought an example here i gue                                 analytics and I'm sure a lot of you I                                 think if they may have redesigned it by                                 now places probably old version of                                 Google Analytics but it's still useful                                 for tiny explain                                 how these positions tie in each other so                                 starting with information design the the                                 graph here over the number of visitors                                 to your site is a perfect sample back                                 you want to make this information would                                 you generally just be a table                                 information accessible and be able to                                 take it in at a glance how many of you                                 have seen the hans Rosling on Ted is                                 talk right so how's rulings its                                 researcher in karolinska and Sweden in                                 heap well he saw Schwartz one long                                 things but one thing he did was that he                                 started working with all this data the                                 UN has under the development level of                                 different countries stuff like infant                                 mortality rates life expectancy literacy                                 all these factors and the UN they                                 collect this data consistently but they                                 have them as massive tables you can make                                 you can you can make sense of it so he                                 started working with I think he's ornery                                 son in law to build this company and                                 they designed this decided flash app                                 which visualize the data in a way that                                 made sense he could basically compare                                 the development stage of different                                 countries at a glance and his knees                                 presentation which I really recommend he                                 shows how this works the going from                                 those tables he applied information                                 designed to make the data accessible                                 available to lock my people and the                                 really amazing thing is he really change                                 of people perceive many countries of                                 africa in terms of why they standing in                                 development compared to the rest of the                                 world so information design can have                                 political impact all right the                                 experience design the quality of user                                 experience it has to do with it has to                                 do with a with a with the overall look                                 and everything this is this is very much                                 a maida maida subject of it but a thing                                 here could be a thing it could be how                                 everything ties in the balance                                 information architecture                                 the navigation system which subjects go                                 under what subjects like like like where                                 does for example why do my reports go or                                 if I want to see how many visited my                                 fondness for example or will they go for                                 example information architects often                                 work with the designing menus for                                 websites which to reflect the content                                 structure in terms of taxonomies or                                 categories and subcategories we also                                 design here you see we're both men is                                 that both the top menu in the left menu                                 can everyone hear me by the way because                                 I keep hearing they like when I turn                                 around the the microphone doesn't                                 capture my voice alright used to build                                 engineering what font size font size do                                 we have how do you tell how do we                                 achieve legibility for example what                                 color should we use contrast ratios                                 trying out different design different                                 users and see how well they achieve                                 their goals in one with one type of men                                 you know the type of menu for example                                 not the menu structure per se but the                                 more the aspects of it the visual                                 aspects of it how it works it's of one                                 interaction design hmm you let someone                                 play with these tools there's someone                                 change their let someone changed the                                 graph and see how it can see how it you                                 know change the shape and everything you                                 maybe want to work with a month                                 perspective well maybe just want to work                                 with customers from Europe for example                                 make sure that that makes sense to the                                 user make sure that that interaction                                 that the whole sense making me aspect of                                 this what we in general think like you                                 know when I click here I want to do what                                 expected to do and finally graphic                                 design colors gradient look and feel                                 make sure that the graphic designer                                 supports the user                                 so I guess that bad usability value X                                 can really cost a lot of money but                                 really great usability can really                                 generate a lot of business value too                                 conversely and as pretentious we have                                 the tools to understand the goals we                                 have the tools to identify what users                                 need and to design the solutions we have                                 it in our toolbox like I showed you and                                 according to some this is I mean the                                 numbers the numbers here are different                                 but some say that up to eighty-two                                 percent of project or consider                                 unsuccessful the Standish Group I think                                 found like                                                          around eighty five percent some say                                 sixty percent the somatic the majority                                 of IT projects are considered                                 unsuccessful and if we subdivide those                                 eight percent into what actually                                 happened we can see that the three                                 percent of those of those edit third                                 three percent of projects or she                                 canceled before completion twenty-five                                 percent of delivering time and budget                                 but the results are not with a customer                                 expected hence are not successful and                                 twenty-five percent they deliver what                                 the custom expected but they blow the                                 budget this is a problem I mean how many                                 cuts I mean how many projects have you                                 done where you feel like you actually                                 got all expectations right you got                                 everything on budget everyone's happy                                 there was no stress has it ever happened                                 you see I will live with it consistently                                 it's like it's the status quo is like                                 yeah that's the way it's supposed to be                                 here in our field that you know in our                                 line of work so some of the causes of                                 death or lack of user input the moment                                 like we never talk to the end users                                 requirements are aren't clear there the                                 bios another requirement you're not                                 familiar with requirements they're not                                 you know that there's a lot of                                 uncertainty comes from there which will                                 mix which will prevent expectations from                                 being synchronized                                 and of course liquidation re unrealistic                                 to begin with so I'd like to talk about                                 a tool here called effect mapping and I                                 talked about it previous conferences how                                 many of you are familiar with this idea                                 all right some of you icy icy my skin                                 the Navy and friends you're recognizing                                 it so this is this exists in many shapes                                 of forms then what what we're using is a                                 methodology that developed by a company                                 called menus which is based in Sweden                                 it's when you see this you're going to                                 think it's kind of obvious sadly enough                                 it's not obvious enough because not all                                 people think this way but the basic                                 ideas of effect mapping is that every                                 website every internet whatever you do                                 is build for a reason there's a business                                 goal there's a rationale behind it                                 secondly that rationale that gain will                                 never come to fruition unless someone                                 less you're engaged end user this                                 someone uses the site so your goals will                                 be to understand the business rationale                                 and figure out who needs use the site in                                 order for the rationale to come to                                 actually lead to something concrete I                                 the result of this work is an artifact                                 called the effect map and I'm going to                                 walk through briefly now how it works to                                 design an effect map so what you should                                 start with is there the walk of why the                                 custom comes to you and say hey we need                                 a better website are you like why but                                 it's really hard to find out who we are                                 and there's no way to post comments and                                 feel involved why a big show where your                                 customers want to feel involved we're                                 getting up to something here okay why we                                 need to reach those customers no channel                                 more sales suicide really there's a                                 business reason here better website                                 translate some more sales it's kind of a                                 contrived but as you can see you can                                 actually help your customers come to the                                 conclusion of where they need to go okay                                 this is good because this means that                                 they can exit a projection of gold which                                 means that you can actually see you can                                 actually budget the website the budget                                 of ways interested in relation to the                                 actual game if they want if they want to                                 increase sales by certain factored they                                 also know how much more money they're                                 going to make the                                 way and they can also see how over how                                 long time they want to write off that                                 investment so what you need to do is to                                 reach this customers in order to channel                                 much else to our site so what to do next                                 is we firmly doesn't affect the effect                                 of building this site the effect should                                 be concise no more than a sentence it                                 should be measurable and this is really                                 important a lot of improvements in                                 business come from actually from setting                                 in action doing an action setting                                 something in motion and measure it and I                                 tively measure evaluate and refine and                                 as we all know kpi's key performance                                 indicators are hard to distort you find                                 how to design but try to come up                                 something you can agree with the                                 customer and this also puts a bit of                                 pressure on you because they can really                                 see that whether you failed or not it's                                 what failed a harsh term but whether you                                 actually reach the goal it becomes very                                 concrete the good thing is that you can                                 actually agree on something the good                                 thing is that both parties need to                                 actually take responsibility for the                                 result you can't just ship off the psych                                 let's say now we're done here so how do                                 we design a measurement well there are                                 many different ways I recommend that you                                 try to go with the quantifiable                                 measurements much possible concrete                                 numbers looking at percentage of                                 visitors than engaged in countering your                                 side comment and share it and so forth                                 how many years is that we funnel through                                 text reply stuff the conversion rate and                                 the pensive you to come back and                                 interact more these things are very hard                                 very concrete hard facts you can measure                                 you can using forms or a question is so                                 forth yeah questionnaires you can use                                 questionnaires we have to remember the                                 call to data you get that's subjective                                 data and is valuable but the problem is                                 that you can interpret the results so                                 we're going to lead the discussion but                                 just consider the implications of what                                 kind of data collecting how you use it                                 so in the center of the map I showed you                                 before there's the effect now they say                                 the examples from from internet so it's                                 not the specific example but the theory                                 is the same so we put the effect in the                                 center of the map                                 that's where everything seems from let                                 me put the measurements for determining                                 whether we achieve the effect and that                                 all the measurements also have a time                                 frame                                                                  months we want to see the seventy                                 percent of staff for logging into the                                 internet on a daily basis so okay so we                                 asked our we talked about the users but                                 who are you sir that we can that we can                                 find out thanks for thanks to our                                 toolbox here using inducible engineering                                 we can learn things like who are the                                 users what go to the need to achieve                                 what task they need to carry out and                                 what it needs our requirements user                                 built offers a bunch of techniques and                                 methods for for interviewing users                                 collecting that data and making sense of                                 all right so we know how the use of star                                 and talking into the customer they can                                 tell us which users are most important                                 which ones do they need to engage the                                 most in order to to read through the                                 goal so we put them on the map branching                                 out to the right from the from the                                 effect next step                                 what how how do they conceptualize the                                 information they need so for these users                                 to be able to help to this use it to                                 engage with the side use it so the                                 customer so because your customer                                 actually gets the result they want they                                 have their own goals you have also have                                 a reason becoming the website you report                                 seems for you like why do you go to                                 Amazon where you want to buy books it's                                 more complex than that like did your                                 reasons are probably many more but buy                                 it by figuring out your users reason for                                 going to site and designing by that you                                 can engage them sounds can obvious but a                                 lot of people skip this step and in this                                 case if your website is help the                                 informational it could be the structure                                 of the content what kind of content do                                 you expect if you go to a government                                 agency you want to find out the tax                                 regulations in start in case like you're                                 running your own business they wonder                                 how much track text am I supposed to pay                                 the aliases should spend work figuring                                 out why are you coming from what is your                                 loan on which the oven and what kind of                                 menu structure would you expect what                                 category would you look under what                                 keywords would use for searching so what                                 content is in what content is created                                 and used the all the facts are coming                                 here is expired for example like making                                 sure that count is up today to make sure                                 there are that's highly that's clear                                 market also and HUD so it's related how                                 to actually tagged and classified and                                 how everything is labeled for you table                                 to fight with me and like I said we also                                 want to know what users goals are the                                 goals and behaviors when you come to the                                 site what's in it for you and here we                                 can apply a series of a series of tools                                 experience design what do you expecting                                 with it what do you need how do you want                                 the website to feel and behave in order                                 for you to trust it in order for you to                                 want to carry out the task for reaching                                 your goals how do you need how do need                                 attract with it and how do you need to                                 look and the only way to do this is I                                 talking to users so if you went to a                                 book site or you use the compass                                 internal internet what would motivate                                 you to use it more                                 but someone say well I wish I could                                 download I could sort of i could apply                                 for my vacation on the internet oh I                                 could see their phone numbers for my                                 colleagues I was like okay how do you                                 want your phone number directly to look                                 for me said I won't be able to search                                 I'm going to be able to find out I want                                 to be able to sort easel and everything                                 it will immediately show another                                 features a lot of requirements will just                                 pop out like that so knowing bit more                                 about our users and what how they get                                 engaged in the website we also need a                                 part of Gaussian because again we want                                 to see how well we help the users                                 achieve their goals because if we have                                 achieve the goals we won't get the                                 result you want the effect will never                                 come will never be realized and likewise                                 we make them as great as possible when                                 we make the measurable so we also map                                 these onto the onto the effect map in                                 this case the administer staff wanted to                                 replace all the paper forms with online                                 forms they want to avoid getting a lot                                 of phone calls because it gets rid of                                 knowing call                                                             able to answer questions directly on the                                 internet so and that in turn translates                                 your actions be able to create forms and                                 being able to let people to do the sign                                 forms and as you can see we put the the                                 measurable the the goal above there by                                 the green flag the beautiful thing about                                 this these can then come out the user                                 stories go into the backlog the customer                                 can then using the effect map prioritize                                 them and you can you have up you have a                                 really great starting point to to to                                 help the site actually deliver a lot                                 more value for the customer so you sort                                 of bridge the gap between visitor crime                                 as the implementation by capturing the                                 needs of users and by converting                                 business value using we use this                                 research and design in to require                                 specifications and that's where a real                                 life but it's not always easy to explain                                 why it's important that they kind of                                 change it you can achieve with that and                                 i'm going to introduce an a chart here a                                 way of visualizing it from you exact i                                 didn't write this article i I'm just                                 retelling it here I'm going to put the                                 link to the original article article                                 here if you want to read it but I'm                                 going to summarize it this is called the                                 uc's value proposition and here's a                                 chart so when you comment when you're in                                 your room when you're working on a                                 project and you want to tell you want to                                 explain what kind of what kind of                                 improvements you can make using you x +                                                                                                         becomes like a strategic overview of                                 what tasks would necessary how much                                 effort you expect and results that would                                 come out of it so first or you start                                 looking at all day or the high-level                                 functionality the site stopped like                                 stuff like with this website for example                                 this is this is a release example as an                                 e-commerce site so this customer they                                 have a brick-and-mortar store in a                                 motor-car d commerce site they have a                                 number of high-level goals of course you                                 want to migrate users from using from                                 come to the store to buying online they                                 want to increase conversion rates they                                 want to increase awareness support these                                 are the high-level business goals then                                 you break those down in terms of                                 usability these are your tools how can                                 you use your tools to improve to                                 actually assist in achieving these goals                                 stuff like usability appeal                                 accessibility and performance                                 alright so using Isabel to looking at                                 these goals you can see what we need to                                 do web genito for usability equivalent                                 to better than brick and mortar it needs                                 a peel to audience it's currently not                                 using online shopping and offer                                 accessibility for people with is built                                 for example so in order to achieve the                                 goal of convincing people to go online                                 to go to store these are the things are                                 your toolbox that you need to do then                                 you look at the current store is a hard                                 to find your stuff how to shelving                                 everything and how could it look on a                                 website what is the potential what is                                 the potato to potentially improvement                                 this could go from a week as we stall is                                 that is that if you do it subjectively                                 it's very much it's very much I think                                 you would have to argue pretty Tesla for                                 it but if you can base it some factor                                 research it gives it gets pretty pretty                                 convincing tool this way you can show                                 the gain the potential and you can show                                 the tasks and the effort required to                                 achieve those and they help to show                                 would which which tasks actually                                 generate the most gain for the least                                 effort and so forth and you go through                                 and do this for all the business goals                                 and you break them down into usability                                 is built-in tools in your toolbox or you

           one case where usability really really                                 can make a difference in e-commerce and                                 i found this story last year it was                                 written by jerry spool who as you may                                 know spoke at rubicon in chicago and                                 it's about how changing a form on a                                 custom ecommerce website increase                                 revenue by three hundred million dollars                                 per year                                 Oh                                 so this is what they're visible third                                 this is what their shopping cart page                                 looked like you brought the side you had                                 a products to your cart and you clicked                                 I want to go don't want to go to em when                                 I don't see the card and you had two                                 options oh we had                                                    either login or you can register and                                 they did some research oh I should when                                 did sign this no this is great you know                                 like like repeat visitors they can just                                 they can just repeat customers gets from                                 the information they don't need to fill                                 in the shipping details now ever it you                                 know it's a win for everyone and no                                 users they just need to go through                                 registration process however in reality                                 uses got really annoyed they're like                                 honestly like I just want to buy stuff I                                 don't want to get him all in a                                 relationship and why do you need my ship                                 India's they're gonna spam me you know                                 that was really the whole perception                                 from the guys in science system was not                                 really at all in sync with what you use                                 for thinking so so so these are looking                                 at into this whole rationale that usage                                 actually save time and everything so                                 when they started talking to uses                                 observer people use a site there's a lot                                 of users forgot her password and they                                 tried again and try it again didn't                                 sometimes didn't remember the the email                                 address to use to                                                    first place so the the the the password                                 reset email didn't even write the                                 current in my account they may have                                 migrated emails can't they may have sort                                 of giving a hot meal for gmail know two                                 years back but even when he got the                                 password reset Emil's                                                    were never clicked so                                                  buyers were lost right away at this                                 point right at this point they just                                 dropped out and it's a way different                                 email and I just forget I forgot about                                 it and they later analyzed data base I                                 turns out a lot of users had tons of                                 accounts from the fact that had been                                 they have been coming back to cited by                                 didn't forget the details and they're                                 really registered and that made that                                 database pretty much worthless in                                 formula from a business point of view in                                 in order to keeping customer information                                 because there was so much duplicates and                                 so much incorrect data so much somewhere                                 in the address details of us are they                                 were out of date and manic you should                                 just forget about it like I got better                                 things to do I don't want to struggle                                 with this I can go to their competitors                                 day so it's not a bit then like okay                                 let's make a simple change instead of                                 having a login form let people just                                 continue make a button which allows it                                 just check out and just pay right now                                 you can you can pick your register if                                 you want other but that's optional you                                 can just continue right now and you                                 don't need to worry about passwords or                                 anything and the results results came                                 almost right away for the five percent                                 increase in revenue which translate to                                 three and three hundred million dollars                                 and that's from removing one simple                                 button in it but arriving there was the                                 fact of realizing that yes there was a                                 problem here but they didn't catch it                                 with analytics because this step                                 actually happen after look too many                                 people that should pick the shopping                                 cart and there was no problem with the                                 conversion there but everything that                                 happened after the shopping cart was out                                 of their analytics chain so they                                 couldn't see that so thanks to the fact                                 that the cherry spoon is team could come                                 in and look at how the site work you can                                 see that we have a fondant problem here                                 and using tools like usability testing                                 using tools like user experience and an                                 analyze use behaviors they can find a                                 solution that save them a lot of money                                 made them a lot of money so to summarize                                 you exploit a lot of tools that we need                                 to understand actually users inside for                                 them and using the effect map you can                                 visualize relationships between the                                 high-level business goals the users you                                 need to involve engage to achieve those                                 goals and what goals they need that                                 fulfilled in order to use your site and                                 the Viper position diagram helps you                                 visualize have to show the the                                 high-level business objectives and what                                 what road you explain in achieving those                                 objectives in a very visual good                                 overview and there are at least                                     million reasons why use the belt is                                 is important it helps customers and how                                 because it helped your customers                                 increase revenue thank you for all right                                 we have about                                                          so yes you can talk you may be talking                                 Mike here when it comes to the provider                                 side I mean it's ugly its I mean good                                 options you showed they also have this                                 big capture and it is really hot really                                 captures today are getting higher and                                 higher level and if that kind of a site                                 meets their business goals in this                                 process so they if it meets their goals                                 it's that still ok in that case                                 foreigner I mean reiner became                                 successful with that they're kind of                                 what physically business model I mean it                                 i would call like an anti-pattern sort                                 of like evil ux it's when I use the                                 principles divx reverse them in order to                                 get like it's like in a casino where                                 they don't have any in it did not have                                 any clocks on the walls for example to                                 lose your sense of time you design an                                 environment where a certain behavior to                                 happen so yeah it helps a business goals                                 but I don't think it's I think it's a                                 very short-sighted way yeah so short of                                 course be good use doesn't always drive                                 sales in the short run but personally                                 and I think maybe it's more of a more of                                 a moral or a principle thing for about a                                 principle for me I believe in long term                                 good user experience actually helps you                                 make more money in long run for                                 customers                                 the latest features from riders actually                                 there's a sort of declining sites like                                 maybe having so maybe that's correct                                 well they generally don't like their                                 customers either because they well it                                 complaints they ignore complete they                                 don't even bother about them and they're                                 really rude also about it so so                                 I think you can look at you're gonna get                                 software like we have a lot of                                 conventions when you start using a                                 computer like windows for example you                                 have to get you saw this convention what                                 a drop-down looks like how it works its                                 behavior and so forth and then we have a                                 lot of we have a lot of these design                                 patterns in software then it comes like                                 software that's very extreme like for                                 example like                                                           and they used to need to expand on those                                 metaphors and i've been i've been                                 looking at those really fascinating how                                 they because you don't want to use have                                 to read the manual to figure out the                                 things work some applications like                                 Photoshop which I the test for its poor                                 usability you have like you need there's                                 a tiny area here to can then it's like                                 all the options available there's no                                 clue at all that it's there some are                                 done poorly and some have actually able                                 to explain how the software work through                                 the user interface there's a book called                                 the semiotic engineering of                                 human-computer of user interface think                                 it's called it by I think she's                                 Brazilian Brazilian news researcher and                                 her idea is that when you design a user                                 interface you communicate to the user                                 how the application works it may not be                                 actually how it works technically but in                                 the message of the user interface you                                 can note you can explain how things make                                 sense if you can take that perspective                                 and design a website like like I said                                  like ordering things logically putting                                  things in sequence you know I think                                  that's how you can achieve better                                  results in terms of user user users                                  grasping how to use a site more quickly                                  I don't know if I answered your question                                  because I tried to see how much now if                                  you if you can weave can't avoid it try                                  to provide information or help but make                                  it as streamlined as possible maybe use                                  and videos or something like click here                                  for ten second be to see how you do this                                  so they never have to stop or go looking                                  somewhere else if you really have to                                  have a complicated if you have a                                  complicated process if there's really no                                  way if you can't go by conventions                                  what's wrong well you know I put a                                  button says don't click me you know just                                  typed on taking me on it now it i would                                  i would try and figure out when the user                                  comes with a screen what what what are                                  they supposed to do I mean it's                                  something that really made me laugh was                                  when we looked at the did you spell                                  testing on Drupal                                                       Drupal and you basically create a story                                  or a page have you seen the video of the                                  eye tracking and you see these subjects                                  that s obvious sort of looking like a                                  needs the eyes go up and down up and                                  down up and they can't figure out the                                  difference up and up down so that could                                  be one way you could add that would be                                  one case where you could actually play                                  eye tracking to see whether why is there                                  kid attention going lacking the money to                                  to render by eye tracking you could also                                  ask us to think out loud because think                                  out loud basically just to speak out                                  their thoughts right I'm here on this                                  page now I want to do this I see this                                  okay thats makes me think why is that                                  where did you know why don't you go                                  because I think the problem is that your                                  when you see the page you have a                                  perception what the user wants or does                                  and that is not grounded want to peruse                                  actually thinks and I think that's the                                  exercise we often designed based on                                  assumptions                                  an empirical information actually try to                                  find the actual case here like like like                                  figure out what to use it once I she                                  wants so talk talk to more users do test                                  and ask them to think out loud because                                  it may be something fundamentally you                                  haven't sort of quest about them                                  increase of sales what do you have it                                  has to be realistic and I don't think it                                  should be a gleam blame game set up the                                  beauty of its that the closer I realized                                  you need both in to work together they                                  need to be clear about where they want                                  to go let's be clear in providing clear                                  requirements they need to provide all                                  the knowledge they have regarding their                                  target groups and their needs and so                                  forth all the market day that they have                                  so you can do your job it's not a way                                  for you to to be the one to take the                                  blame if things don't work out because                                  you just do one part of the solution as                                  I said a lot of the UX lies in a copy                                  and things that you should not on your                                  table copy could be highly market their                                  site to who the market to the market to                                  they may be marketed whole different                                  target groups anyone need to sign for                                  and thank you can't read it I mean if                                  they're not if you guys are not working                                  in you know and if you're not working in                                  synchronous and synchronized and like                                  working as a whole it doesn't help it                                  doesn't help how much how great your                                  work                                  I mean if you go to a website I mean I                                  mean by making people sign up like if                                  you were designing a new website or                                  something of course I think I think                                  systems that are appeal to users are                                  perceived the thing is you can you can                                  have a perfectly a beautiful written                                  piece of code but the user interface is                                  poor people going to assume that the                                  quality the surface reflects the cult or                                  the interaction what they see because                                  the understanding of the system where it                                  comes from how they perceive how they                                  work with it no it's only I know I'd say                                  it's not all of just marketing but I've                                  been talking a lot of like revenue                                  things here because that's usually                                  something that makes your customers                                  listen it's hard it's cool it's cold                                  hard cash it's like they can't argue                                  with it and then so if you can show that                                  to them then you can avoid a lot of lot                                  of annoying long discussions before I                                  can get to your work you know get to do                                  what you like to do so I so you can                                  apply these principles regardless if                                  it's an existing customer or you're                                  building a new website                                  or someone over there had question yeah                                  I wish them when I was in Amsterdam Lisa                                  Rix had a session on how do you spell                                  testing at aquia and she mentioned a                                  number of different tools they key is                                  for you cannot upload your site                                  and they have this base it's like it's                                  crowdsourcing crowdsourcing user user                                  testing tools but a lot of people think                                  that you needed to have the perfect                                  target group we need to talk to actually                                  end users you can learn a lot of things                                  just by grabbing your colleague or                                  grabbing your mom or your friend or                                  someone and put them in a room and and                                  see what they do you will discover it                                  probably eighty percent of all this of                                  the problems that all the serious                                  problems will discover that way but if                                  you want a bigger pool then I suggest                                  you look at some of those I don't                                  remember them exactly but you can you                                  can probably find recession the website                                  or you can email hey Lisa but Rex a                                  queer calm and she probably be happy to                                  point you to those                                  buy something you know if you succeed                                  with the pie you don't really get I mean                                  oh so is that sometimes becomes shows a                                  little too brutal result because they                                  actually are                                  I agree and it's going to weigh in on                                  your results and a lot of things you do                                  in research that you take you take one                                  group and take a control then I need to                                  take all the factors into account and                                  it's the same thing here and if you can                                  motivate people not with money but with                                  something maybe maybe like getting them                                  about sure for a meal or a movie ticket                                  or something enough for it to be                                  substantial but not the cash I think I                                  think it takes much better better way to                                  incident sort of great day inside of you                                  know to take part and the best things                                  probably we can ask friends or family                                  someone want to help you not necessary                                  to feel like this complete a task to get                                  their money                                  Yeah right that's a good point all right                                  the right one first                                  I would I would create a prototype and                                  and put a user in front of computer you                                  can very very simple used to build the                                  test there's a really good book called                                  rocket surgery made easy what made                                  simple made easy i think it's called and                                  it's about the guy who wrote don't make                                  me think and it was a very simple way                                  visa bill testing you basically take two                                  rooms give me your conference room you                                  put a computer with skype do like                                  videoed is like shared screen and you                                  put a computer outside the room and you                                  have an instructor in the room and you                                  have someone who is doing the usability                                  testing and you show the prototype and                                  you give them a task and then the other                                  people in other room can watch and                                  observe and see what the person is doing                                  if your developers were to watch someone                                  use the prototype to perform the task                                  they were probably better to relate to                                  the user another trick is also to work                                  with personas like when when you decide                                  you to design for anyone you actually                                  create a set of people they can relate                                  age interest background everything you                                  can also imagine / standing in front of                                  you thinking what would he or she think                                  how would they respond to this what what                                  back on do they have so and some my am I                                  suggested to do you write out personas                                  and you take them to the wall so they're                                  always there with you this is the                                  perfect this is the perfect person                                  people i'm designing for these people                                  i'm helping it becomes much less                                  abstract then                                  I don't think you should ask you used to                                  design you should ask use it what they                                  want to do and your job or your                                  designers job should be to find a                                  solution which helps you use to do they                                  did the job an alias a lot of talk was                                  with pd participatory design it was                                  really popular and it sounds good but                                  it's it's it's much it's much it's much                                  trickier because users users already                                  users don't really understand their                                  needs they think they understand the                                  needs but in reality they don't it's                                  like this is really great video with                                  Alan Cooper who is heard of him he sees                                  his his his his unknown you expected                                  this for maybe                                                         him like about involvement users said                                  yeah that would be like that would be                                  like letting the kids in the                                  kindergarten run the kindergarten if                                  they say I want ice cream you looking at                                  ice cream you know you say you give them                                  you give them man broccoli and said                                  Evita broccoli you'll have your ice                                  cream so I said he he wrote a book                                  called the inmates are running the                                  asylum on this topic like yeah so try to                                  design for the users be the best friend                                  but but realized that that your                                  profession is to is to design the tool                                  so they can get achieve their goals and                                  do the job they want to do and have to                                  do and prototypes and and and try to                                  involve your developers with the end                                  users as much as possible let's bring                                  the bring the developers across the team                                  I heard of some companies where the                                  project manager is like the proxy                                  between developers and the customer or                                  the end users that's horrible avoid that                                  are all costs                                  so you have a lot of tools in your                                  toolbox and which one would give you the                                  most most bang for the buck which one                                  would be which one would generate the                                  most value for the customer early on and                                  I would probably do wireframing and I                                  would do you information architecture in                                  that kind of that kind of site and I                                  would try increase in some time to talk                                  to some and agent to figure out how they                                  would relate to the content because I                                  went with a customer and they had there                                  was a union in Sweden they had so much                                  content and they brought in this this                                  agency works when analytics and they                                  suggested whatever for level you know                                  navigation menu I'm like yeah imagine at                                  four levels and the email it has a                                  certain many items would lead they would                                  have there would be several many items                                  that were the same led to the same page                                  and that's the problem with the                                  navigation menu because navigation menu                                  reflects the ontology your understanding                                  how different country let you tell it                                  terms like subcategories and so forth                                  the problem is your understanding of the                                  content relates it's much different from                                  how your users perceive it especially                                  comes to things like like labor unions                                  because they are they have people that                                  are professionals are in labor law and                                  they've end users that are amateurs they                                  were whole different perception of what                                  is what in what we call it and in case                                  of you have a continent and site I would                                  try and get a better understanding the                                  card sorting task for example you can                                  accuse online tools there's something                                  called often openwork youtube com they                                  have a series of tools they have tools                                  for three tests interesting of men use                                  their tools for testing card card                                  sorting it kind of pricey but if you can                                  get if you can if it's something you can                                  apply for several projects or put it on                                  the customers built fine it's it's it                                  that would be a way to actually to to do                                  it in a faster way than happy to bring                                  people to your office you guys customer                                  to send a link to some of its some some                                  of the members some of their customers                                  may be nesting like would you please                                  help us and then you can we become get                                                                                                        enough to you to get better idea                                  yeah but what are you testing for like                                  the yeah yeah but that's something that                                  it's a certain be testable using a wire                                  frame for example the best Tyler with                                  the test would kind of what kind of                                  artifact you need to produce like you                                  may not even need to have a ready                                  designed to test something like that                                  what I think is tricky so when you do                                  work agile because you want to do to                                  that case you want to do testing and                                  every Sprint's of the problems you                                  discover can be can be added to the                                  backlog the best thing is if you can                                  test the sight of weight once you get a                                  release you have the hell demo page user                                  story but you also have a use of bill to                                  require me to stories you can actually                                  validate each issue story that it                                  actually works to its pulse will end                                  users                                  I would what we've been using mostly                                  it's mockingbird it's web-based doesn't                                  look that nice and it's kind of pain to                                  work with but the fact that we can share                                  all the other shareholder where frames                                  within the company easily it is a big                                  plus there's also one let's see here                                  can't remember its name but there's one                                  other one which is much better for                                  creating the clickable prototypes hey I                                  know it takes a lot of time so I I would                                  say the old way you did it was that you                                  had low fight you piece of paper and you                                  say I click there and you shuffle them                                  around you maybe just you draw the                                  interface su test with the user that's                                  also another version but prototypes are                                  never simple to sound with that in a few                                  cases when the customers had the budget                                  but half the budget was designed half                                  the budget was development in those                                  cases it was worthwhile as they thought                                  it was important                                  no I haven't worked with that now                                  yeah I haven't used it but I can see how                                  it provides about the information                                  there's some there's a there's a joker                                  library called hover intent which                                  captured two if you hover your mouse for                                  a few seconds over an item I can capture                                  that so that's the way to to maybe it                                  gives on in some indication how the user                                  is thinking yeah well ya know it's not                                  the same but I'd like to see that I                                  tracking I think I hear a lot of cases                                  these days when people say want to use                                  filters you know but I can't afford I                                  tracking I say you don't need eye                                  tracking during the eye tracking to                                  usability it's it's nice to have in                                  certain cases but it's far from required                                  I guess everyone's it's really hungry                                  right now so you can if you have more                                  questions you can you can just send an                                  email or something and i'll pass it by                                  email instead all right thank you so                                  much for coming
