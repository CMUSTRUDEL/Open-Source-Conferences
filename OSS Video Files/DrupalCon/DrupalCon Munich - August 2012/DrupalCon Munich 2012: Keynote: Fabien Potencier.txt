             know it's a small room there most people                                might not be aware of it but there's a                                lot of the major Drupal books that are                                in the market that you can buy there                                they're cheaper than what you can get                                online I mean it's cheaper then                                amazon.com with free delivery                                and it's all the all the domani goes it                                goes directly to the to the people who                                made these books so it's it's definitely                                and it's definitely a good deal there                                one thing that happened yesterday is                                motion in this room he must be somewhere                                I I don't know so I think most people                                know motion vitamin he forgot his                                eyeglasses in the Cuvier room so if                                anybody found them yesterday after the                                last session and make sure to get them                                back to him or get in touch with us and                                we'll get them to him there's another                                person who also lost something and this                                was a little bit more unfortunate                                because apparently a laptop was stolen                                yesterday and we have a very open                                community it's we have a lot of friendly                                people but unfortunately there are some                                people who still do that who still do                                that kind of things so if if you took                                that laptop and you feel like you know                                maybe you should return it please do and                                everybody else please make sure that you                                keep an eye on your belongings we have a                                lot of people here there's people coming                                in and out and yeah keep an eye tomorrow                                the conference well the

has been                                described by some people as the most                                valuable part of drupalcon because you                                really get to work

way to get involved if you have                                never written a Drupal core patch if you                                are not sure what the procedure is like

               involved but some know exactly how                                they're                                going to walk you through all the steps                                it's

                            to speak today at my second Drupal                                 conference and report conferences are                                 very impressive for me probably because                                 you know some so many people here in the                                 room so many people excited about and                                 commit it to Drupal that that's really                                 awesome so as you might know i'm the                                 creator of symphony which is a PHP web                                 framework and you might as you might                                 know now drupal                                                        reason funny components so if you don't                                 like this change I'm the one to blame                                 and if you like the direction drupal                                   is taking which i hope really then you                                 will probably see still be able to blame                                 me at some point when you know when you                                 eat the first bug in Drupal                                            obviously related to symphony and and                                 I'm not kidding I'm quite serious and I                                 mean you know for the lover architecture                                 of Drupal now you can rely on other                                 developers on an azure community and I                                 think that that's great and of course                                 symphony will probably also benefit a                                 lot from you know drupal and and the                                 Drupal community but that that's not the                                 topic for today I'm not                                 to talk about Drupal I'm not going to                                 talk about symphony I'm not going to                                 talk about PHP of course a lot of                                 examples i'm going to talk about today I                                 are more or less related to these                                 technologies and at the end of the                                 session you will be able to ask any                                 questions and please if you have                                 questions related to symphony or to                                 Drupal or the you know that the                                 association between symphony and Drupal                                 i will add me answer and then at the end                                 of my talk so today I want to talk and                                 yet this is the ashtag you want to hear                                 on Twitter so today I want to talk about                                 the people working for the web you may                                 web developers and web designers project                                 managers and you know all those people                                 were probably passionate about their job                                 passionate enough and also you know                                 those people have great responsibilities                                 and they also have a unique opportunity                                 to change the world and up for in good                                 ways so a lot of people keep asking me                                 how I have learned everything I know how                                 did I learn you know how to code and how                                 did I learn about all the web                                 development best practices about all the                                 best and design patterns and so on so                                 that'll be tough to explain but my                                 experience is probably not reproducible                                 bye bye everyone but anyway I want to                                 share what worked for me so to begin                                 with you have to understand where I come                                 from I have no computer science degree                                 Percy and anyway I started to act                                 computers when I was very very young so                                 let me start with the story about height                                 all started with me for me it was                                 Christmas                                                                I was                                              time and I this one dream getting my                                 first real computer and we were lucky                                 enough to have some computers at school                                 at that time was not that widespread but                                 only my own computer was one of my                                 dreams now for the younger in the                                 audience you must know that the early                                                                                                         computer and the personal computer area                                 so I owning a computer at that time was                                 you know not that widespread and just                                 adding access to a computer was not dead                                 easy at that time and Santa Claus was                                 can enough to deliver a computer to me                                 and my browser's for Christmas                                        got an M strat CPC                                                    monitor answer computers were very                                 popular at that time at least in Europe                                 and the CPC's                                                         the best computer available at that time                                 and I even had it even add an internal                                 floppy disk drive now can you believe it                                 yeah you know another computer with you                                 know a regular cassette tape deck but a                                 real flop you geez it was so fast I was                                 really in heaven and and have a look

   experience with the computer yet I want                                 to stop on this screen for a moment                                 by default when booting the machine you                                 were on the common line right but more                                 interestingly you were able to start                                 cutting right away you were able to type                                 instruction directly and thanks to the                                 built-in you know text editor ide                                 whatever and the bruising basic language                                 and you can see you know the line basic                                                                                                     awesome you didn't need any other                                 software no ID no text editor no                                 compiler nothing everything was built in                                 just type through program run it debug                                 it and save it on disk that was all and                                 as a matter of fact the user manual was                                 about                                                                  well explained I read the book for for                                 this keynote and it was really really                                 well made actually it took me less than                                 five minutes to learn how to do what you                                 just see on the screen yeah I've done                                 the demo this is you can do the same on                                 CPC box.com but you know I didn't have                                 time to create these can format the disk                                 an answer yeah so and beside the basic                                 language you also had access to the logo                                 language where you it was really easy                                 you know to draw lines and circles and                                 so on it was really very fun nowadays                                 when you buy machine getting really to                                 code is not that easy anymore I think we                                 need to learn something about that how                                 can we make the learning process easy                                 and phenergan and recently there have                                 been some great initiatives are going on                                 on that side and there is codecademy                                 that come for instance but i think that                                 the new computer science section of the                                 key an academy is just awesome by the                                 way how many of you have already heard                                 bad                                 academy okay not that many so the Ken                                 Academy is the theory behind the Kami                                 website is it's just amazing one that                                 proves that one person can change the                                 world thanks to the web and is not even                                 a web developer so the founder can

problems at some point                                 because it was helping so many people in                                 his family he started to record some

           or weeks ago and its really awesome                                 basically it allows you to start cutting                                 in the browser with javascript and the                                 experience is just amazing with you know                                 there is a video explaining everything                                 the fact that you can't you know try                                 everything out you put your car on the                                 left you see the result on the right and                                 so you have immediate feedback so very                                 small snippet of the first video let's                                 start out by learning how to draw some                                 basic shapes with code it's really easy                                 if I want to draw a rectangle for                                 example I can just type rest which                                 stands for rectangle and it open                                 parenthesis                                 and then four numbers separated by                                 commas then closed parenthesis and                                 semicolon hello and if you're thinking                                 what the heck did she just do then good                                 that means you're thinking this thing                                 right here is a function call now a                                 function is kind of like a special                                 ability that your computer has so if                                 cemeteries this is exactly the same                                 experience I add more than                                              with my amstrad right the only                                 difference is that i had a blue-screen                                 now the screen is white it was basic it                                 is JavaScript now but this is exactly                                 the same experience I think it is a                                 great initiative and I think it can help                                 a lot of young people get started faster                                 with computers and you know without the                                  to install a lot of different                                 things to be able to start cutting so x                                                                                                          in my life and it was quite easy to get                                 started but as far as remember becoming                                 a programmer was never one of my dream                                 jobs I think it's because for me and                                 programming has always be about adding                                 fan trying to solve problems finding                                 solution to these problems learning new                                 things being able to make the machine do                                 stuff for me right I like you know                                    G's I like to explore new worlds so I've                                 always seen writing code as a B and not                                 really as a job and when I grew up I                                 started to think about you know creating                                 my own company because being an                                 entrepreneur was my dream job actually                                 so that's what I did at the school I                                 created my own company which is about                                 web development and I'm quite interested                                 in understanding how people decide to                                 choose and a web related job from my                                 experience as someone who hire of you                                 know web developers and project managers                                 very few people actually wanted to do a                                 web related job in the first place as                                 essential we have people having so many                                 different backgrounds and that's very                                 Raji and really interesting and a couple                                 of days ago I asked this question the                                 question about your dream job on on                                 Twitter and the question was target                                 specifically for women why because they                                 are underrepresented in our industry and                                 I don't really understand why this is                                 the case I mean Alice women are                                 underrepresented in France in Europe                                 probably in the US and I know that this                                 is not the case everywhere in the world                                 it's not so this is probably you know                                 related to some cultural issues and if                                 you ask me we need more girls in our                                 industry we need more girls doing web                                 related stuff                                 why you know they have a different                                 approach to solving problems and that's                                 a good thing it adds a lot                                              point of view different perspective for                                 the problems we have to solve so I got                                 quite a few answers to my question and                                 they were quite interesting some of                                 course we're already interesting in                                 doing in working for the web but the                                 vast majority of them were dreaming of                                 something else and the most popular job                                 seems to be astronaut yeah that is quite                                 surprising an architect was also quite                                 popular and I think it kind of makes                                 sense you know a good developers must                                 also be a good architect so you work for                                 the web you are a freelancer you are                                 working for a big company you are                                 probably working for a small web shop                                 but you are all working for the web and                                 you are all using open source software                                 obviously but why why have you chosen to                                 work for the web and why on earth I will                                 chosen to work with up and switch                                 software I mean this is a great choice                                 no question about it but working for the                                 web is not an easy job that's for sure                                 the web is evolving at a very fast pace                                 the technologies are changing all the                                 time so this is a very demanding job                                 with very few rewards so because working                                 for a web is so difficult and exhausting                                 at times I would even say that working                                 for a web cannot be considered as a                                 regular day job right when I say dead                                 job I mean something you do for all the                                 money not necessarily for and because                                 you love the job and when you do                                 something you know only for the money                                 you tend to limit your involvement to                                 what is required for the job to get done                                 and to be a good developer you need to                                 do a lot really a lot I'm also web                                 developer but it is definitely not my                                 job I've been                                 gramming for the last                                                  programming is my passion and I think is                                 his height should be for everyone                                 walking for a web is more passion than a                                 job if walking for the web is just                                 another job for you you are going to be                                 in trouble I can tell you what because                                 the web ecosystem evolves very fast you                                 know in the old days probably the first                                 Earth of the last decade developing a                                 website was really easy you had to learn                                 some HTML perhaps some masculine PHP and                                 you know that was really easy and all                                 things of websites was also                                 straightforward install PHP my sequel                                 Apache done or choose from the many                                 Austin companies that provide the same                                 for a very cheap price but it was a time                                 where you had limited choices and the                                 majority of people chose the same stack                                 anyway the famous lamp stack and the bad                                 news is that most of the time this is                                 not true anymore the web is becoming                                 more complex every single day and of                                 course now you want to scale your                                 website to under more traffic you want                                 to benefit from the latest innovation                                 and the current best practices so it was                                 you know Ajax everywhere some years ago                                 it is about the web sockets nowadays the                                 rich client again with JavaScript the                                 possibility to under more than one                                 devices the dev ops movement and so on                                 so we are now in a world where you need                                 more techniques and more software even                                 for the simplest websites and it's not                                 going to stop quite a contrary and                                 that's why I love doing web development                                 it's great to be part of the web                                 revolution you can and you probably                                 should literally learn something new                                 every single day this is really exciting                                 and of course open source apps a lot                                 here it has never been easier to learn                                 new stuff it has never been easier to                                 have a look at others code and learn                                 from it and if we are talking about web                                 design I think this is the exact same                                 story the possibilities nowadays are you                                 know almost overwhelming we studied with                                 a very simple simple web pages yeah we                                 talked about pages some years ago with a                                 very limited HTML language and now you                                 can use videos animation it's all about                                 html                                                           responsive design and you still need to                                 find innovative ways to work around the                                 many constraints the web still else                                 right even project management is                                 evolving very fast the way we worked                                 some years ago is very different from                                 the way we we are working nowadays right                                 and if you are still doing web project                                 the same way as before which is what is                                 you know explained on the screen you are                                 in trouble and new customers are in                                 trouble as well so if you don't want to                                 constantly challenge yourself if you are                                 not willing to reinvent your job on a                                 regular basis yeah then look for a new                                 job the web is definitely not for you so                                 being a web developer must not be your                                 day job but your passion don't kill me                                 here is a tweet from a couple of days                                 ago during drupalcon and this is yeah                                 kind of embarrassing really but I don't                                 want to blame you right                                 but not choosing a version control                                 system when developing a website                                 nowadays well this is a big no-no right                                 it was not the case ten years ago but                                 now it is there is no question about it                                 you must use a version control system                                 for all your projects and the good news                                 is that we have awesome tools now and                                 the fact that many Drupal developers do                                 not use version control system yet not                                 yet is just another proof that keeping                                 up with all the changes is really                                 difficult this is true for best                                 practices but also for the basics right                                 so time for a commercial now I cannot                                 speak at a conference without mentioning                                 HTTP because the web you know would be                                 nothing without the beauty and the power                                 of the HTTP protocol so I have the same                                 question at every single session and I                                 do how many of you have already read the                                 HTTP specification okay so see not that                                 many I know you are not all developers                                 but you know everything you do with                                 Drupal is powered by the HTTP protocol                                 and with Drupal                                                       even more important for Drupal                                 developers so if you are a developer and                                 if you have not read the HTTP                                 specification yet it's about time there                                 is a lot of interesting stuff to learn                                 here and instead of feeding the original                                 specification this is the first link                                 with the HTTP peas document instead this                                 is a right of the original specification                                 so it's not a new version of the HTTP                                 specification this is still HP                                         this document clarifies the HDPE                                 specification and the organization is                                 also much better so you can read just                                 one chapter tonight on another one                                 tomorrow and be done by the end of the                                 week I mean it really you should do and                                 I think that even you know project                                 managers                                 should read your HP specification and at                                 least very fast but they will they will                                 they will understand a lot of things by                                 reading the specification and if you are                                 not a developer and if you you know if                                 you don't really understand how a web                                 developer think work and you I recommend                                 you this book and actors and painters                                 and it's really a great and if you you                                 are a developer you can definitely read                                 it also so learning it raining the HP                                 specification keeping up to date with                                 everything takes a lot of time and you                                 probably don't have much time at work                                 right for such activities so this should                                 mostly be done on your spare time right                                 so the web is complex the web evolves at                                 a very fast pace so keep learning right                                 to become a good developer you need to                                 learn allow things up front that's for                                 sure but then you need to keep learning                                 new things to stay up to date you need                                 to learn about you know the new best                                 practices the new standards the new                                 software the new technologies but                                 learning is not enough you need to gain                                 experience and nothing can replace                                 experience let me tell you another story                                 this is a sad story really and it took                                 place during abuse                                                       a                                                                      years old man were married but they                                 decided to split up and add it happens                                 quite frequently in such a situation                                 they kept adding arguments about a cell                                 phone you know sending text messages it                                 to each other right and that's a typical                                 real life situation but at some point                                 ramazan                                 this text message to his ex-wife it                                 means anyhow whenever you can't answer                                 an argument you change the subject                                 nothing special in the message but not                                 is that there is a mix between the I                                 letter we all know that with a dot on                                 top of it but also some I letters                                 without the dot but as ramazan cell                                 phone could not reproduce the I letter                                 without that right isn't this message                                 instead the problem is that even if you                                 know the message is quite the same the                                 dots added on top of the                                            change the meaning quite radically night                                 means and you won't offensive language                                 read anyhow when is whenever they are                                  you you change the subject and I                                 don't have to explain why Amin Amin was                                 shocked when she received such a message                                 but well in the first place ramazan did                                 not anticipate this issue because for                                 the meaning to be different you also                                 need to replace the last letter of the                                 world from A to E right so knowing that                                 the vast majority of the cell phones in                                 Turkey were not able to deal with the                                 dot less I and because it didn't send                                 the ending of the world he thought that                                 the message was safe right but any red                                 message quickly and she did not realize                                 that she actually miss interpreted the                                 meaning so I said it was a sad story and                                 here is why shocked by the message I                                 mean showed it to her father and a                                 feather and really called ramazan and                                 the accused aim of colonies daughter a                                 prostitute so ramazan went who is wife's                                 arm                                 to apologize and to explain the                                 situation but it was attacked by his                                 wife her father and two sisters it was                                 studying chest but is succeeded in                                 grabbing a knife is having his wife and                                 getting away the father and the sisters                                 were arrested and put in prison Amin                                 died and of bleeding and ramazan killed                                 himself in prison that day the lack of a                                 single dot over letter caused by a tiny                                 technological constraint close a chain                                 of events that ended with very tragic                                 consequences and if you are thinking                                 well it's only about cell phones in                                 Turkey so I'm not concern at all you're                                 wrong you're totally wrong as a matter                                 of fact if you have already worked on                                 international websites you know that                                 localization is difficult time zones                                 parsing and displaying death Pershing                                 and displaying numbers is playing                                 currencies etc that's a lot to care of                                 but that's the easy part as you know if                                 you don't get it right it is easy to                                 party issue and to fix them and actually                                 latest version of PHP gives you all the                                 tools you need to get it right but the                                 doubtless I'll later is slightly                                 different and kind of unique and again                                 if you have already worked with on                                 international website with some users in                                 Turkey you it issue at some point it was                                 probably at nightmare to identify the                                 problem why because you know some random                                 users you think that it what it is about                                 random users they reported the website                                 does not work at all for them right it                                 works for you it was for everybody but                                 some you know if user it seemed to not                                 work for them then you have a look at                                 the error logs and you are not able to                                 understand how is it even possible to                                 have such random errors it looks like                                 they don't                                 have the same code exhibited how is it                                 even possible right you have just                                 experienced the turkey issue this is                                 such a tricky issue that someone create                                 a logo that you can use when your                                 software pass and this is what it calls                                 the turkey test so what is it about this                                 is because in Turkish they really have                                 two different I letters one with a dot                                 and one without that right two different                                 letters so let's see if PHP itself PS is                                 the turkey test so let's say we have a                                 user the user is able to choose is local                                 and choose this Turkish so this is the                                 very first line here on the screen and                                 by the way if you don't understand the                                 code no big deal you will definitely be                                 able to understand the consequences of                                 the code and if you are a developer you                                 can try this script down and then we                                 have two lines and it is very easy we                                 have you know two straining we want the                                 lowercase version of the first one and                                 the abacus version of the second one                                 right and this is the output it's                                 totally messed up right doesn't make any                                 sense how is it even possible and if you                                 think that this is just you know a small                                 annoying display issue again you're                                 wrong try this now so this is the same                                 script we have the Turkish local we                                 create a new class test it and then we                                 create a new instance of the class I                                 think phantom and now if you are not                                 aware of the problem with Turkish if you                                 have not identified that the error only                                 occurs where the user selects the                                 Turkish local you lost why would a class                                 not be found only randomly that's                                 because of the problem I've just                                 explained by the way the burb was                                 reported for PHP in                                                     the only software to have this issue and                                 the good news is that the fix was                                 actually merged about three month ago                                 yeah no comments on the fix itself so                                 how many of you were aware of the                                 Turkish issue one two three four four                                 people right okay for the others well                                 you have learned something new today                                 good so that's part of your

           have a weird / quiz you know like a                                 class that does not exist only for some                                 people you will remember his dog and if                                 that ever happens please send me a tweet                                 so but this story also tells us                                 something else as people working for a                                 web web developers web designers or any                                 other related job web related job we                                 have great responsibilities but we are                                 in charge of software that are used by                                 millions of people they are using our                                 software to do their job to the business                                 to our people so try to not screw that                                 up at you need to get it right keep                                 developing websites gain experience that                                 that that's important but there is                                 something else you need to actually be a                                 good web developer this is the curiosity                                 be curious to learn about you know you                                 practice best practices new standards                                 new software new technologies and you                                 need to look around don't limit yourself                                 to the community you know able to get                                 other languages have a look at other                                 technologies as a matter of fact simply                                 is fully example                                 where we borrowed some ideas from other                                 frameworks with in many different                                 languages I am sure this is exactly the                                 same for Drupal so for instance in                                      I started to use gmail in symphony for                                 configuration files and because you know                                 I used it a lot when I was doing pearl                                 and and we are still using Yammer for                                 configuration file and now Drupal                                      also going to use Yammer for                                 configuration file and tris did a small                                 demonstration of that dream is keynote                                 but sometimes simply borrowed ideas from                                 technologies I've never ever used myself                                 and most of the times these things                                 happened during conferences and speaking                                 at many conferences are in the world but                                 when attending a conference I don't like                                 drinking beers that much I know it is                                 probably not good to say that drink                                 conference happening in Munich but yeah                                 that's the truth but I definitely love                                 bookstores so whenever I got a good way                                 conference I need to visit a local                                 bookstore even if if I don't you know                                 speak the local language I by many books                                 mostly technical ones I love books                                 sometimes I read them sometimes I don't                                 the one in Japanese for instance it                                 doesn't matter i need to buy books and                                 so for years ago i was attending the                                 mass equal conference in the US and as                                 always I will I was looking for a good                                 book treat I stumble a pound piece book                                 about spring spring is a Java framework                                 so I've never learned java I've never                                 written a single line of Java but the                                 book looked interesting and I was                                 curious about how spring solved web                                 problems by the way Craig wash is a                                 great author and he explained things in                                 a very easy way so after reading the                                 book i grasp dependency injection and                                 why you wouldn't need a dependency                                 injection container if you don't                                 understand what a dependency injection                                 in container doesn't matter                                 and at that time I was working on yet                                 and as our symfony                                                  pretty happy with everything but you                                 know I was this something that annoyed                                 me a lot how to manage dependencies                                 within the code so i read this book and                                 suddenly you know everything became                                 clear man ma'am what I needed was a                                 dependency injection container so I read                                 the book in one fell swoop and two hours                                 later I started to curl my very first                                 dependency injection container prototype                                 our study to dig Java code I got                                 inspiration from the Java code and a few                                 days later it was red a fully-featured                                 dependency injection container written                                 in PHP bathe on the spring I jeez of                                 course the code was not different from                                 jail one but the concepts were similar                                 and the names too so instead of trying                                 to reinvent the wheel I based my                                 solution on a proven one one that has                                 been popular for so many years in                                 another language of course the concept                                 had been adapted to the PDP world but                                 the solution for the problem i add you                                 know it is quite similar and since then                                 i've tried to adventure lies on my new                                 knowledge and i talked about a                                 dependency injection during in many                                 confirm scenes and as a matter of fact                                 nobody is almost all major PHP                                 frameworks are looking into using a                                 dependency injection container for their                                 next version and Drupal a is no                                 exception yes there is some Java                                 framework philosophy embed into Drupal                                   that's scary yeah I know but this is my                                 advice drink left peers read more codes                                 read more books                                 so you some big curious benchmark have a                                 look around right also because you know                                 people do not realize that developing                                 web site is still challenge there are so                                 many things that can go wrong we still                                 have problems with you know                                 compatibility between browsers we can                                 have asking issues scalability                                 multi-device this report perform                                 instability and bugs everywhere                                 requirements changing all the time so                                 many things are not ready yet for prime                                 time right so we do do call our industry                                 you know computer science but in reality                                 we are still craft name our website are                                 still and made craftsmen who are                                 changing the world changing all the                                 other industries one at a time but we                                 have not built our own industry yet we                                 are craftsmen but we should also be                                 artistic because you also learn a lot by                                 experimenting trying new things stupid                                 things and Alec chain challenges I like                                 you know to push the limits it helps me                                 learn new concepts and it started very                                 early in                                                                 french magazine it was challenged and an                                 interesting experiment for me it was                                 about cutting a full game in less than                                                                                                         you add a limit for each line of code                                 this is the first line well frankly I                                 have no idea you know what it does and I                                 have tried to you know it doesn't                                 doesn't make any sense anymore but it                                 was my first published could ever and                                 probably my first free piece of software                                 very proud of that and                                 and from time to time I still do you                                 know some experiment some years ago I i                                 did some experiment with twitter i                                 wanted to see if it was possible to                                 embed a free working program in a tweet                                 written in PHP which is you know really                                 a challenge because p                                             verbose so my first successful attempt                                 was a framework that fits in a tweet so                                 this is a framework an MVC framework                                 naturally now we don't have the humic                                 chili and yappy speeds of you so we have                                 an MVC framework here and later on I                                 also published published a dependency                                 injection container that fits in the                                 Twitter if you don't know what a                                 dependency injection container is this                                 is it it was not really serious you know                                 but I wanted to prove that it was at                                 least possible to do something like that                                 I also wanted to prove that you know the                                 big names we have for a design patterns                                 all the nails we give to some concepts                                 like you know frameworks dependency                                 injection container are actually much                                 simpler that then what most of us think                                 and it also adds to make a difference                                 between a concept and an implementation                                 right oh I like this one and I'm not the                                 only one to have fun we scaled some time                                 ago someone open an issue and Twitter                                 bootstrap project and get AB yet a                                 problem and when using gjs mean on the                                 bootstrap code you know to minify the                                 code yeah bootstrap is is written in                                 JavaScript and it was not working so                                 apparently the developers of bootstrap                                 do not lack the semi co-write so for I                                 aesthetic preferences I think so they                                 don't use them right so you have two                                 lines of code there is no semicolon at                                 the end and this is totally valid in                                 JavaScript but sometimes you need to put                                 a semicolon to avoid ambiguities and so                                 the perp was closed I pretty fast but                                 Douglas Crockford studied flame war in                                 the commands for this issue when he said                                 that is insane                                 stupid code learn to use semicolons                                 properly and then many people started to                                 give their opinions and things got out                                 of control pretty fast as you can see                                 more than two android commands on the                                 single issue it was closed right away                                 but the interesting part is that someone                                 found the description but the semicolon                                 quite funny and it created a new                                 language where the only valid characters                                 are semicolons and spaces if you don't                                 understand the code this is a way to                                 print hello world actually it works so                                 be curious try new things explore new                                 worlds often don't stay in your comfort                                 zone I would even say don't reinvent the                                 wheel just to understand how things work                                 do create your own CMS do create your                                 own framework but please be pragmatic                                 don't use them for commercial work I                                 mean most of the time                                 and yeah you know most of the time the                                 things you are you create are not robust                                 enough even if they are extremely                                 valuable from learning experience so                                 sometimes using you know using custom                                 code at the sort of problem is is easier                                 right you have something to solve and Q                                 you just write some code javascript PHP                                 whatever just works and it's probably                                 easier than learning existing libraries                                 and frameworks and Seamus's but it is                                 always a great learning experience and                                 much better to actually learn how things                                 are done by authors right remember this                                 how many of you have already used                                 netscape two point oh wow you are old                                 okay so so working for the web is                                 difficult but at the same time we are                                 very lucky because we understand how the                                 web works right and so yeah you are old                                 enough so you so you know you you grew                                 with the web so most of us followed all                                 the incremental changes you know on the                                 web and and the web you know some years                                 ago it was just about HTML static pages                                 and that was all now we have more                                 complex one so if I start to talk about                                 pop smtp are see each other whatever you                                 are going to understand what I'm talking                                 about it was it is probably not the case                                 for the orders I mean our parents and is                                 probably not the case anymore for the                                 younger you know at least the barrier of                                 entry is gigantic for them right I think                                 it is a problem there is disconnect                                 between people who know us and the one                                 who don't know and                                 you know most of you probably think that                                 the younger people are feeling                                  comfortable when browsing the web I'm                                  not so sure many people just do not make                                  any difference between the Internet the                                  web a browser and address bar Google or                                  Facebook right if you don't believe me                                  let me tell you a story you've you've                                  probably heard about this one in early                                                                                                          on facebook and the title was facebook                                  wants to be your one true lucky the                                  article itself was about a deal on AOL                                  and Facebook and but that's not your                                  interesting part let that are now half                                  an hour and after the publication the                                  number of visitors on this article                                  started to grow significantly and after                                  just an average article which number of                                  visitor and average article might see in                                  an entire day so something strange was                                  happening and the commands on the                                  article said looked really weird and                                  totally disconnected from the contents                                  of the article a deal between AOL and                                  Facebook why would you let me sign in                                  all I wanted to do was log into my                                  facebook account I don't like this new                                  way I need your facebook this one is                                  very bad and androids of similar                                  commands what was going on if you want                                  to log in a facebook you probably open                                  browser you type facebook com into                                  address bar right is your enough or you                                  create a bookmark for it so that it is                                  easy to access but apparently many                                  people do not do this instead they go to                                  Google they tap type facebook login in                                  the search box and                                  they blindly click on the first result                                  but that day we were thought that the                                  rid web web article was the most                                  relevant page for the log in facebook                                  keywords and so it was first in a result                                  page so people are using a search to                                  Google as a navigation tool as a                                  bookmarking tool some scary yes yes it                                  is so at some point a website at where                                  this more text to explain the situation                                  to visitors these side is not Facebook                                  this is a website called with where web                                  that reports on news about Facebook                                  right to access facebook right now click                                  here for future reference type Facebook                                  that coming to your browser address bar                                  we recommend that you then say Facebook                                  as a bookmark our but unfortunately to                                  understand that text you need to know                                  what browser is what an address bar is                                  and what a boot mark is so people did                                  not figured out that it was a blog post                                  about Facebook not Facebook itself well                                  even if you have a quick look at the                                  page looks pretty obvious now the logo                                  the colors it cannot be Facebook so                                  people get stuck pretty easily and as                                  web developers we have huge                                  responsibilities we make the word work                                  or not we have the power to make things                                  easy or complicated I'm talking about                                  web developers but I think this is                                  really about all the people working on                                  the web for the web you know the web                                  designers responsible for                                  signing user interfaces even project                                  manager I think so you should don't                                  believe me that this is a large number                                  of people you're probably thinking this                                  is just a small proportion of the                                  population it cannot be true and here is                                  a video recorded by google in                                           this is scott from google we're here in                                  Times Square New York to find

                                                    countries and it took                                                   Industrial Revolution to achieve the                                  same results as you can imagine that is                                  particularly relevant for developing                                  economies this demonstrate a positive                                  impact of the internet and the spirit                                  which it delivers there and that's                                  because everything around us is turning                                  into a computer your phone is a computer                                  your camera your television your car                                  your fridge you name it and mostly                                  everything you do now involve the                                  computer reading a newspaper reading a                                  book booking your utter room playing                                  games buying foods listening to music                                  and all those things you can do on a                                  computer as mostly possible thanks to                                  the internet internet is probably the                                  biggest revolution ever right and so the                                  instant the internet is changing the                                  world one in straight time but I believe                                  that most innovations on the internet                                  are not driven by a big corporation like                                  Google Apple Microsoft whatever I                                  believe that the major changes of our                                  world are initiated by people who are                                  passionate enough to do big things and                                  most of the time there are people like                                  you people who understand the web and                                  the Internet is a great neighbor really                                  it's still
