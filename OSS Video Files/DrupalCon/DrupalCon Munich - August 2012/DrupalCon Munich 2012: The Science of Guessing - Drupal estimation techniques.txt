Why this panel is good:
- Because experts who have been down difficult estimation roads will share their knowledge and help you to interpret the client's needs.

What you will take away from this session:
- Ways to identify issues around estimation, and solutions to solve them.

and during project management for about                                six years and I'm currently taking a                                short break between jobs to do some work                                on Drupal                                                               owners and come talk to me afterwards if                                you have questions are you want to talk                                more about project management hi                                everybody i'm mateus axes own from                                happiness web agency in stockholm sweden

invited                                by Shannon to take part in this and I                                happily accepted a bid you in Drupal                                since                                                        co-founders node one now mundo crowd all                                right so this is a panel originally but                                we figured it would be better to do some                                talking beginning to maybe recent topics                                and get some ideas going so when we're                                doing our part here if you come up with                                any ideas question anything feel free to                                tweet here's the hashtag at the end                                we're going to go through the question                                list i'm going to ask your questions as                                a panel at the second part of this                                presentation                                in case you can't see it it says dresta                                mate like drupal estimate yeah your                                estimate alright so why are you here ok                                so when someone asks you what you know                                to do an estimation for me how many                                people have this reaction right here                                kitty scared not good how many of you                                have this one sad kitty doesn't like                                estimation what about this one I'm going                                to straight up murder you if you want me                                to do an estimation no well I hope it's                                not any of those but if it is guess what                                you're in the right room we're here to                                talk about this and at the end if I                                don't skip over the slide there it is at                                the end what we really want is for you                                to feel like happy kitty doing your                                little estimation dance I know what I'm                                doing so we're going to cover what is an                                estimate what not to use them for what                                affects them and how you can do it then                                at the end you get to ask your questions                                so remember to use that hashtag we're                                going to be checking the feed so we can                                get those questions all right so what is                                an estimate so the Technic explainer                                estimate is it's a calculated calculated                                approximation of a result which is                                useful even if input data at may be                                incomplete for surgery and like we said                                essentially with the little information                                you have try to come up with a likely                                scenario and then we believe that a lot                                of your product managers is that true                                how many of you are produce managers                                alright so majority so you're probably                                this is youth that's the idea you're a                                lady deal with it yeah and these are the                                questions you have what is it what's in                                an estimate and what advice can we give                                you all right so estimates concern work                                some kind of like the effort required to                                finish a project                                and estimates estimate should encompass                                a number of tasks and not just the work                                itself so if you look at all the bubbles                                here in arrows first of all we have the                                bubbles to the left the loop the                                attentive work you do including                                requirements clarification writing use                                cases your refinement theming                                development and testing and then when                                the party is over you also need to                                figure out how to put the site live                                deployed and you also in many cases you                                also need to provide training for the                                customer and during the whole course of                                project you time would require this                                 approach manager to to provide guidance                                 and to make steer the project all right                                 so on to requirements requirements                                 clarification so one example how you can                                 clarify requirements is by working with                                 these cases now a lot of a lot of                                 requirements come in terms of use of                                 stars is this a format you guys are                                 familiar with user stories all right can                                 we see some hands all right so I don't                                 think they need in a further explanation                                 user stories are pretty brief they                                 talked about who does something well                                 they do why use case on the other hand                                 they're way more extensive that's all to                                 develop it with need to actually to                                 declare all ambiguities and all                                 different ways you can interpret a                                 requirement so that's something you                                 probably need to do a lot of the                                 functionality in order for developers to                                 really understand what the customer                                 needs to do and this is going to take                                 time it is something you tested me for                                 likewise the UI often it starts with a                                 simple simple markup someplace with a                                 wire frame and over the course of the                                 project as you understand more about the                                 product requirements they go from                                 wireframe to maybe a comp to maybe a                                 finished mock-up the real work this is                                 what will you should think about one                                 estimate this is stuff we estimate but                                 it's just a fraction of everything the                                 coding and the theming and know that                                 everything that's included there testing                                 it can be a simple serving someone                                 clicking on the website and see there                                 aren't any bugs or any defect but in                                 bigger projects it becomes more more                                 important to do automated testing big                                 products become so big that you can't                                 possibly as a human being figure out                                 every combination of content of pages or                                 anything and you also have what we call                                 regression Ares bugs that reappear or                                 appear later something that used to work                                 suddenly doesn't work because you did                                 something I broke the functionality the                                 best way to avoid that is they have an                                 automated test then automated test                                 simple piece of software to make sure                                 that the other piece of software does                                 holy and again this is something                                 else you take into account finally                                 finally training training your customers                                 training editors training staff anyone's                                 going to use the website how it works                                 and and what you need to think about in                                 this slide you can see it's also to                                 deployment and even if you're not                                 deploying the site even the customers IT                                 departments doing it they are going to                                 have a transept answer questions you                                 probably have to be like a Drupal see                                 sobs consultant and that's time that's                                 going to take time and you need take                                 that into account and charge rate all                                 right so they the PM part here so I'm                                 talking about this because I've seen                                 this happen a lot in the Buffs that I've                                 been holding people don't always account                                 for p.m. time or even a percentage of it                                 and I'm here to tell you that's a really                                 big mistake that's really really common                                 in estimation always include your p.m.                                 time it's valuable it's going to keep                                 everything on track account for it and                                 plan for it in your estimations and                                 we're going to tell you the percentage                                 that we usually do later on in jacob's                                 part all right my clicker is not working                                 all right so why do we need estimate                                 well so these are the questions of                                 promptly section how does an estimate                                 help you plan the project what does it                                 communicate and how does help your                                 budget now estimates are for good and                                 for bad and we're going to get to the                                 bad later used for planning budgeting                                 and communicate                                 regarding the project on the project                                 planning is the most obvious and common                                 use for a for estimates say for example                                 that say for example he estimated                                 probably will taken                                                   that teacher with team members can work                                                                                                        they could work for essentially five                                 days and including that is also part                                 smashing time like this oh you got your                                 calendar plant perfect that's one way to                                 use to estimate it will give you an                                 indication how for how many days to need                                 to book your resources your developers                                 your testers your theme arisa designers                                 and that's also often assuming that the                                 project will be like a straight road do                                 you know the the pedal to the metal and                                 just race ahead but in reality produce                                 you should turn out more like this like                                 an old packet rail up in the andes with                                 mudslides knowing and holes and even                                 worse and more often i would like it                                 looks like a traffic jam in new york                                 these are things that happen and a lot                                 of many estimates and many project                                 planners don't take this into account                                 and how can it happen well a lot of                                 projects as guys gives you like this                                 this is a team or this is a small team                                 at a company and the managing three                                 projects in parallel project be for                                 example is its plan to take seven days                                 but but but we figured week and a half                                 later customer comes back and tells them                                 they have added a few major adjustments                                 it is super important so you your team                                 has to work weekend meanwhile project a                                 is running the green one here and it                                 really looks fine you know emphasis                                 running on time really happy until like                                 two half weeks later turns out you have                                 tons of bugs and they are their business                                 critical maybe it's an e-commerce site                                 and they're not making any money they're                                 losing money every second and meanwhile                                 you're front-running project see and                                 with this kind of planning what's going                                 to happen it's going to a very tired                                 development team eventually                                 yeah and they're not going to be that                                 kid I think so budgeting there's a                                 second part the customer what can it get                                 and for what money essentially what they                                 want and what the red prepared to pay a                                 lot of cases customers know what want                                 but you don't know how much effort it's                                 going to take it to the end of the                                 project do you know how much you don't                                 know how much it box ways until by the                                 end it makes it easier if the customer                                 can put a price tag on it you can                                 actually have an idea of its worth to                                 the custom in terms of business value                                 but that is not always the case if the                                 customer can provide an estimate how                                 much value each of these features                                 provide for them you got halfway I mean                                 thatthat's thatthat's good progress                                 because i'm going to show you later well                                 that's useful information then suddenly                                 we can weigh the business value against                                 the budget all right this doesn't tell                                 you the whole picture cuz actually to                                 need to estimate how much time it's                                 going to take and for that you need to                                 use your team your team can rate the                                 feature in terms of how complex it is                                 how familiar you are with it and whether                                 it's depending on out on other functions                                 they built or or external API sort or                                 such factors that will influence the                                 time it takes to complete it and you can                                 post it as a yellow posted like a sailor                                 on the side of box so they think that                                 this box here which has a best value of                                                                                                       deliver so with this information we can                                 suddenly compare the estimated effort                                 compared to the money and they have and                                 that is provided well provided this                                 information is pretty accurate you can                                 make some interesting you can make some                                 choices here now we keep you put the                                 value in the effort / risk on two axes                                 here now they are at risk you can                                 explain that briefly the more effort                                 uplink it takes you should that also                                 reflected higher risk so something that                                 takes two                                 to make you sure has a higher risk of                                 running over that estimate                                 proportionately you want to usually want                                 to go friend things in the sweet spot                                 the low-hanging fruit the things that it                                 used to do and leave it a lot of                                 customers the value to the customer and                                 reversely there the stuff you want to                                 avoid the red sector the stuff that's                                 that expensive and doesn't leave a lot                                 of value that stuff you would rather                                 actually avoid at all if you could then                                 you have this stuff that actually makes                                 a lot of value but a lot of work but the                                 underhand it was a lot of work it's a                                 lot of risk which means that it could                                 potentially run over budget so using                                 this grid here this quadrant you can                                 rearrange your features and get a visual                                 idea of what stuff you should go after                                 first and what stuff that's most you                                 know potentially run over budget                                 generally you want to go for the                                 low-hanging fruit and for the hard stuff                                 first so the top left and top right the                                 problem once you would want to plan                                 early in the project and get done with                                 so you can focus on the riskier and less                                 valuable stuff later on and but this                                 assumes that the team is actually pretty                                 sure but they won't be sure until the                                 end of the project usually you don't                                 have a clue about the difficulty and you                                 want to turn to think into what they                                 know not what to think well what do you                                 know so finally estimates aren't just                                 numbers there aren't just list of                                 numbers and features and and there                                 should tell a lot more your team must                                 make sure the custom understands what                                 they're asking for and the custom was to                                 make sure that your team understands                                 what they expecting in many situations                                 when you get an RFP a stirring with the                                 lowest estimates you should not what you                                 should do you should actually come up                                 with a number where the customer fields                                 is it's a reliable the communicated you                                 understand the complexity of the task                                 and that you have the required                                 experience to completing it and if                                 you're in good terms you have the same                                 estimates and now everything goes well                                 your friends were their customers                                 so so yeah I'm going to talk about risk                                 and risk management can I ask how many                                 of you are using risk management in your                                 project yeah some of you you probably                                 already know everything I'm gonna say                                 but I think it's much easier to estimate                                 with for existing clients it's much                                 harder for a potential or new client                                 because you don't have any insights                                 about their business needs and you don't                                 have any experience from working with                                 them so you're kind of on unknown                                 territory yeah it's on the right in                                 there oh yeah there we go I I actually                                 served in the Swedish army and one thing                                 I learned from there is that risk                                 management can help you see when the map                                 and the territory don't agree and let's                                 look at some of the burning questions                                 here why should I care so so much about                                 risk early on how do I manage and                                 communicate risk and order common risks                                 with Drupal and what's the point of all                                 these questions of course we want to                                 help you to avoid unpleasant surprises                                 and corrects like this fine transom all                                 crashed don't hassle the hoff don't                                 hassled off yeah and in when you perform                                 a risk analysis what are the steps there                                 are three simple steps the                                 identification face the assessment phase                                 and the mitigation phase and let's start                                 looking at risk identification face here                                 you hear you're going to try to identify                                 all the factors that may jeopardize the                                 success of the project                                 and of course experience is a key                                 component here if you've been in the                                 business for several years some of the                                 bits pitfalls are obvious but if you                                 also plan it's really important with the                                 knowledge and experience with a client                                 so it can be good idea to survey uses                                 and stakeholders and try to ask and                                 extract knowledge from the client and                                 what what is risk two factors impact and                                 probability sometimes it's quite obvious                                 if there is a critical risk but if you                                 don't if it's if it isn't obvious you                                 can use a tool called composite risk                                 index or composite risk rating to to                                 evaluate evaluate risk and it's kind of                                 easy it's a value the impact on the                                 probability on scale one to five so                                 let's look here on the index here's the                                 index with identified risks we got a                                 video component rated as a high risk                                 both impact and probability are rated                                 high so the risk rating is maximum the                                 integration is medium risk it's like                                 quite time on both numbers and the                                 migration is quite a low risk and the                                 asteroid is extreme it's it can be it                                 can be called a Black Swan yeah and like                                 asteroid it's really interesting but an                                 example from the reality is that pizza                                 incident I had with my team some year                                 ago me and all the dev team went to                                 pizzeria had pizza everybody had the                                 same pizza everybody got the stomach                                 disease were knocked out for a couple of                                 days                                 the project were a bit late and it                                 wasn't so fun and to manage the risk I                                 could have sent half the team to                                 mcdonalds but still that's maybe a bit                                 too much so Oh biggest autosys they sort                                 of split                                                               case one crashes you know it's not a                                 death of the company so but did you know                                 like a pizzeria is a perfect example I                                 think you know so don't forget a bit of                                 black swans yeah watch out for them yeah                                 so look let's look at some monitoring                                 yeah okay so this is an example of risk                                 management and classification so if                                 you've got high level risks that are in                                 that red zone between                                                  your opportunity to say okay how do I                                 want to manage this and how often really                                 do I want to look at these risks because                                 you're not going to look at your risks                                 every single day but if you have some                                 that are in that high region maybe it's                                 a good opportunity to look at them on a                                 daily basis if they're going to                                 completely blow up your project or look                                 at them for triggers what's what's an                                 example of this risk is really active                                 and happening right now on a weekly                                 basis for some of those high ones and                                 then all the way down to maybe you                                 ignore them if they're really really not                                 important they have not much impact and                                 you can totally accept that risk so                                 thank you here's an example of what you                                 would do then once you've got your nice                                 little risk register and you've listed                                 out your risks and you're aware of them                                 you're doing your estimation process and                                 you know how these things might might                                 affect you one thing that you can do to                                 communicate this risk clearly to your                                 stakeholders is to do a risk chart so                                 this basically has your impact up here                                 on the right side and your probability                                 down below and if you've got something                                 that's got an impact of                                         probability of for like the migration                                 here you'd stick it in that slot up to                                 over                                                                 that lives so this is a sort of low risk                                 that you don't want to met you know                                 monitor a lot and I've even gone ahead                                 and scheduled some special                                 classifications at the top so that one                                 falls under dude seriously so we need to                                 watch out for it and this is one way                                 that you can look                                 risk chart and kind of see as your as                                 your project evolves what should I be                                 looking at how often should I be looking                                 at it and it's also really easy to                                 communicate out to stakeholders so this                                 is a good tool it's a really good visual                                 too I call it a risk matrix on the                                 really really good for showing for for                                 decision-makers to take decisions and                                 yes you identify the risk you assess                                 them and the now it's time to manage the                                 risk or two to mitigate the risk and                                 first of all you can accept risk and                                 take no action sometimes risk can be                                 good and if the business impact is                                 minimal maybe this is a good idea you                                 can also try to eliminate the risk and                                 for example remove it from the scope or                                 lift it out of the scope like if you are                                 having a fixed price on the larger part                                 of the project but if you identified a                                 critical risk you lift it out them and                                 try to work with that on a running                                 account basis for example and you can                                 limit or shared risk for example by just                                 by working agile I think that's a that's                                 a really good thing that in in kind of                                 sharing the risk between you and the                                 clients yeah so yeah let me tell you                                 true story from the reality about risk                                 management this was some years ago we                                 were approached by television network                                 and they wanted to build an online                                 community where users could upload and                                 share video and we don't divide the                                 encoding of videos as a critical risk                                 different video cams have different                                 formats and to encode these formats to                                 own to the site was at that time quite                                 tricky                                 we found a third-party component on the                                 market but we had no experience from                                 using it so to reduce the risk we                                 suggested further research but the                                 client wasn't interested and they found                                 someone else who could take care of the                                 video component part what would happened                                 of course it went very bad it took a                                 very long time and it didn't really work                                 and the project was late so I was quite                                 happy I didn't hold the bomb there when                                 when when it went off but still it's no                                 fun to be in a project where things                                 don't run smoothly and I think it can                                 affect your business long term because                                 the product went bad and the client                                 you're part of the project and a lesson                                 learned from me we're with this story is                                 that communicate the risk to all                                 partners not don't just use it for                                 yourself free estimate for your internal                                 planning take the risk matrix and send                                 it out to all all parties in the project                                 yeah and finally let's look at some of                                 the usual suspects in Drupal specific                                 projects here and the first one the user                                 interface is easy to change or I fix it                                 later this it's always a huge risk                                 postponing and it's a good thing if you                                 work agile with scrum you always have a                                 review when the demo when every sprint                                 so so watch out for that one and the                                 second API is stable when the                                 integration should be easy this is this                                 is a mistake I made several times to                                 underestimate to underestimate                                 integration it's really hard and                                 sometimes you have to reach out to the                                 main expert and seek help before before                                 even starting isn't it out the reeboks                                 a client it happens it happens to me                                 love that the clients expect more                                 functionality and I think a way you're                                 handling this risk is to educate the                                 client and be really clear about what's                                 not out of the box and there's a module                                 for that this one is really interesting                                 because there are so many modules and                                 there I think there is a module for                                 almost anything but as you probably know                                 just because there is a module is it                                 isn't quick quick it can be a diversion                                 and so on yeah okay so let's let's talk                                 about techniques so we've covered what                                 is it why do we need it what are we                                 going to use it for how to properly plan                                 and avoid pitfalls of the risks what are                                 the common ones now let's actually talk                                 about some techniques that you can use                                 to estimate your projects and who's                                 still awake out there can I see okay                                 good everyone's doing good okay so I'm                                 gonna steal the clicker thank you so                                 first of all questions what are they how                                 do they work what do I use them for when                                 help okay we're gonna help you so next                                 estimation is like a walking stick in my                                 opinion it's it's like a walking stick                                 for a blind man you can use it and it                                 will help you to not walk into a wall                                 but it's not gonna give you site said                                 old Chinese proverb it's Shannon but no                                 maybe not we can't really wasn't sure it                                 was just her so we wrote that this oh                                 it's an old Chinese proverb as far as we                                 know okay so we've got three example                                 techniques for you today and at the buff                                 that we're holding tomorrow at                                 eleven-forty-five in athen we will do                                 some examples we'll do some run throughs                                 so if you're really interested in trying                                 out some of these techniques be sure you                                 come tomorrow to the ball so the first                                 one ballpark top-down estimation who is                                 used this before or knows of it can I                                 see some hands okay so I'm surprised not                                 to see more hands because I think this                                 one is really really common people like                                 oh my client is an estimation                                 and he's got a few things he wants to                                 know what the budget is going to be I'm                                 just gonna give him a ballpark answer                                 maybe i'm going to ask my developer if                                 I'm a really good cool boss or cool                                 project manager I'm going to go and ask                                 them but this does not always happen                                 sometimes people just guess well it's in                                 many cases maybe get a request by email                                 someone said we want to build this site                                 we have this much money you can easily                                 in our head do the math to realize no                                 that's not going to happen anyone okay                                 can I kind of talked them into so the                                 lower than de scope somehow so I think                                 this one is actually fly way more                                 company you would think so the way that                                 you would use this correctly would be to                                 assemble some of the features and                                 discuss it with your team I would say                                 more than just the developer because as                                 Jacob rightly pointed out there's a lot                                 more that goes into an estimation than                                 just the real work in quotes you know                                 the coding in the PHP and the testing                                 that's not everything there's peripheral                                 things that need to happen so i would                                 estimate it with your team and put                                 together some guesses and the reason why                                 you'd do this is to really just get a                                 ballpark vision that you can use                                 strategically this is not something                                 that's going to be super accurate super                                 long term useful so it's a short-term                                 solution next you have the weighted                                 estimate so this one is a little bit                                 more it's a detail how many of you know                                 of the oral estimates lecture I did in                                 Copenhagen in Chicago lots of you have                                 seen this this is very similar yeah you                                 take the features you figure out how to                                 do them what actions you need to                                 undertake and then you figure how long                                 would take to complete each action and                                 then the point here is just to try and                                 break the dead project all its parts and                                 see why what things can be potentially                                 hard difficult so forth you put them in                                 a matrix like this you estimate them you                                 type in the likelihood that it's going                                 to take longer than that what we call                                 the confidence here in my verse was                                 called degree of experience it's the                                 same thing more or less and the end you                                 get a you get a range abolish this is                                 really useful to level set expectations                                 with your client as well so you're not                                 saying it's going to take exactly                                    hours                                 and this is exactly when we're going to                                 do it this gives you a little leeway                                 where you can actually be realistic when                                 you're setting expectations and say look                                 we think it's going to take from this to                                 this this is reality we can't predict                                 everything that's going to happen this                                 is our guests the problem though is that                                 the customer is going to think oh just                                 can do two three hours you're like                                     yeah you know then we breathe everything                                 over                                                                     an experienced customer that doesn't                                 render Stan how to read this true too so                                 the final method is the Delphi method                                 how many have heard of this Oh more than                                 I thought how many have heard of                                 planning poker okay so a lot more than                                 they're the same thing it's also a                                 momentum by the rand corporation assem                                 it is but it's the idea is the same                                 Moorhead's more brains more brain power                                 better results right so oops IX nice                                 keeps good so what you're going to do is                                 put a team together of experts who have                                 experience with a specific feature that                                 you want to estimate and in planning                                 poker they're all going to explain their                                 estimates and you're going to try and                                 come to a consensus general you have a                                 stack of cards you have a scale and                                 everyone gets a vote but you don't see                                 what the other person is voting until                                 you put the cards on the table if                                 someone puts a                                                           know like you either receive this                                 someone that the person with                                            doesn't know or the entire user story is                                 not clear enough or the requirement is                                 not clear enough and then the point is                                 for them to discuss until they can agree                                 on the estimate you not move on until                                 everyone is agree it's an agreement I                                 feel that this estimate is good enough                                 and accurate exactly so finally when                                 should you use what and these are just                                 some indications that you can take away                                 with you so ballpark top down that's                                 when you want strategic decisions you're                                 looking for decision-making not accuracy                                 so the pros it's easy in a fast solution                                 but it's a short-term solution so do not                                 do a ballpark estimation and use that                                 throughout your entire project please                                 you'll make your the builders very sad                                 kind of build a calmer sides in few                                 hours so do that then you have the                                 Delphi method for specific features and                                 you need several experts to do                                 it's going to be smarter and more                                 accurate but it's going to be feature                                 specific you can't use this and develop                                 an entire project estimate you need to                                 reuse this several times in order to get                                 a full project solution we're good is                                 we're going to discuss the problem with                                 estimates to get to get to that in more                                 detail and finally you have waited                                 estimations which is what Jacob                                 explained pretty well so it's used for                                 getting a variance like a range of                                 things you can work with but the only                                 drawback is that it takes some time but                                 you know you can use it to help level                                 set expectations okay so can you                                 overestimate the answer is obvious here                                 because I basically told you that you                                 can so what happens in when the estimate                                 you show us that you start off you                                 really have no idea what you're working                                 with you learn more you try to think                                 about potential solutions you try to                                 make educated guesses about the                                 customers expectations the problem with                                 this is that the more you work the more                                 confident you get your confidence goes                                 up as a Purple Line shows but the                                 problem is that the more confident you                                 get the more likely is that fact that                                 random things will affect your judgments                                 your estimate will actually get worse                                 you more your work with it it's a bit                                 it's been this finish observed in many                                 many cases so that's better to just put                                 a reasonable amount of effort into                                 estimates and not too much because I can                                 actually give you wash yourself don't                                 get too comfortable I think is the                                 takeaway all right so i mentioned that                                 we're going to talk about don'ts of                                 estimates and i know that many people                                 think that it's it's a really bad idea                                 and often they are the idea that we                                 could early on look at a project and                                 based on a lot of variables we have no                                 idea what they are come up with a number                                 for a customer yeah that's often pretty                                 ridiculous idea estimate though they are                                 useful they can be they can be used as a                                 means of communicating something setting                                 expectations if someone comes to you                                 wants an e-commerce site done a simple                                 estimate will tell you that it's                                 probably our custom at least a thousand                                 hours because you know that ecommerce                                 sites are their business critical in a                                 high degree of reliability quality                                 testing and so forth so estimates serve                                 the role but                                 but what's often the case with estimated                                 their use for people higher up in                                 management to get people that do bill                                 exercise to commit to estimates and then                                 use that to push the blame when things                                 aren't delivering time and so forth yeah                                 the whole you said you were gonna do it                                 in                                                                      it's                                                                     this is not to be done people don't do                                 that it's not going to help your team                                 and all you're going to do is demoralise                                 everyone in that project secondly it's                                 important to realize a lot of features                                 are like icebergs you'll only see the                                 top of them and imagine you're on a ship                                 at the North Atlantic and tons of                                 icebergs and a lot of fog first of all                                 the ice pick to see right ahead you know                                 that they're bigger than you look but                                 then once way ahead you can't even see                                 them in many agile projects you start                                 with a backlog and something and one of                                 the ideas of agile is that you learn                                 more and more about the project's go on                                 you know you make decisions as as                                 reality becomes apparent to you what                                 I've done at one point was that i sat                                 down with a customer and they said yeah                                 we have                                                            backlog so I sat down with our one                                 mounted developers and we estimated the                                 entire backlog at detail but I realize                                 what I was doing I was doing waterfall                                 by agile I was doing waterful project                                 management in an agile project water                                 jile yeah so so what's important is to                                 actually accepting it customers                                 understand it you can probably plan the                                 next spin to this point after that it's                                 like it's like flying a tracer bullet                                 and see what's ahead of you and that's                                 as far as you can get everything ahead                                 of that is just are just epics you can                                 just make educated guesses and trying                                 like like we said here work your risk                                 management to sort of to deal with these                                 but you can't you can't make any you can                                 make anything nearly even nearly                                 accurate and then nearly record                                 statements about these things you don't                                 know what problems you're going to hit                                 until you're actually in the water                                 zooming towards that giant iceberg and                                 then you can you can figure out how to                                 mitigate the risk which is I can peer                                 down into the depths of the Atlantic                                 Ocean is like going today okay so yeah                                 that's been off for time                                 so those are some some estimate issues                                 and the last one don't do it in a vacuum                                 don't don't do it by yourself now that                                 neither should a project manager be all                                 by themselves and a team of developers                                 should not if you want to if your                                 project manager don't make estimates                                 yeah just don't ask your team it's not                                 your job it's not your you're not the                                 one doing the work you're not the one                                 who can say how long this is going to                                 take get your team together more than                                 just development and discuss it as a                                 group this is the only way that you're                                 really going to cover all of your bases                                 in estimation so if you're just going to                                 your development team you're making a                                 mistake if you're just a project manager                                 you're making a mistake it should be a                                 group effort it's it's it's a lot of us                                 we're specialists we're going to burn                                 for what we do but that also makes us                                 vulnerable because we also look at you                                 know if all you have in hammer is hammer                                 everything looks like a nail it's                                 special true in this case developers                                 saying they can develop themselves sort                                 of problems dishonestly they can assign                                 themselves sort of project problems                                 project manager think they can plan                                 themselves lateral problems so just                                 relying on one of your one of the people                                 at your team with expertise will make                                 you blind to all the alternative                                 solutions are so finally our takeaways                                 we've got some things that we want you                                 to remember hmm okay what you wanted                                 this computer yes I wanted to like do a                                 hypnosis thing everyone watch my hand                                 now remember this okay so first of all                                 management by estimate it's a very bad                                 idea this is what we were talking about                                 we're using management of your estimates                                 as a blame factor you said                                              didn't do                                                               project failed that's not the right way                                 to motivate your team it's not the right                                 way to get better accuracy on your                                 projects all you're going to do is                                 create a culture of fear where people do                                 not want to even estimate they're afraid                                 that you're going to point the finger at                                 them and say you're wrong you're putting                                 responsibility on them in a in a way                                 that makes them at fault where the                                 better solution is to focus on lessons                                 learned and to focus on trying to find                                 techniques and identify the reasons why                                 the estimation was off                                 so that's that's number one yeah an                                 estimate uniqlo more than just                                 development like I said it's I do you                                 have to show you remember all those five                                 bubbles in that big arrow that stuff and                                 also make sure you involve people that                                 do all of those parts and they're just                                 more the numbers like a like in the case                                 of before estimates communicated the                                 customer how you perceive their problem                                 and it cut to it tells them how you                                 would go about solving it so remember                                 that even estimates have a subtext they                                 actually carry a message more than the                                 number more than the sum itself and use                                 management yeah usually to avoid the                                 problems you can identify it's a                                 sometimes I ask the developer how long                                 how long is it how long so long it's the                                 corner a steak and a i get like oh it's                                                                                                          it may include so it's really good to                                 discuss it with the with the team just                                 add one quick note to that when you're                                 doing this you know risk analysis and                                 risk assessment you got your pretty                                 little chart you don't just want to                                 identify them you know and try and say                                 oh well I think it's going to be huge                                 someone to put the impact is five really                                 try and understand what is the impact is                                 it if this thing breaks does the project                                 lose all of its value what really is the                                 the monetary impact is something you can                                 measure as well if you know the value                                 that the client is provided so there's                                 lots of ways that you can use this                                 really to increase accuracy and to                                 prepare for the inevitable problems that                                 might arise yeah sometimes it's worth                                 just avoiding something altogether just                                 going to lead to trouble ahead and I'm                                 not yes they know all right roll the                                 move rule of thumb you're in charge                                 sorry                                 no we don't all the no no no all                                 right so we behind last to ask you to                                 review this tell us what you think about

when you go that                                 link there should be a button or tile or                                 tab some button click and sort of review                                 this

suggest getting quote by in from new                                 clients when we're explaining the agile                                 process that's a great question so                                 basically what can we do to get our                                 clients to it                                 cept agile there's lots of things I                                 think the opening bands how much time do                                 you have I think we've got about                                    minutes for questions my general answer                                 this question is that waterfall is so is                                 usually about an incorrect assumption or                                  perception about control like you as a                                  customer yours customer or in a better                                  position if you can control more factors                                  that control Hybris is it's a complete                                  illusion a lot of products are driven                                  driven about requirements and I did a                                  session in Vienna about this called                                  upgrade your offer and i believe we as                                  drupal companies need to focus less                                  requirements and more on the kind of                                  business value there are solutions bring                                  our customers and it's when you should                                  focus the business values you're going                                  to realize the requirements are just                                  secondary they are just one idea how to                                  actually bring the business value about                                  in a website my suggestion is that you                                  throw out the requirements in a sit down                                  with the customer and try to figure out                                  what is the business value eventually                                  you'll see it's a pretty concrete thing                                  it's a number you can see the right off                                  of that investment you can actually                                  translate it to actual money and in that                                  and when you do that then you can see                                  what what what's a reasonable budget a                                  lot of customers they haven't even done                                  this way they haven't even thought this                                  work because there's a tix reasons for                                  building a website the building internet                                  are often taken at a management level                                  and the IT in IT department our task                                  would you know drafting the requirements                                  because they've seen so many requirement                                  documents and they're the ones task                                  returning to you for you to produce a                                  number on a document which may not be                                  relevant at all and so the big case is                                  saying the projects which are focusing                                  on a business value nor an agile in                                  their nature will deliver better results                                  they worse delivered what you I mean                                  it's actually if you can't deliver                                  everything what should you focus on and                                  there's really no way of knowing it                                  unless you know the actual business case                                  where project yeah so try and understand                                  what what does your client want why are                                  they there where's the value and I would                                  say if you can try and start small start                                  with something that's going to provide                                  value for a small amount of effort so                                  that you can start off with a win and                                  you can gain that trust because I think                                  one of the reasons people shy away from                                  agile is because they're very afraid of                                  the risk and as Jacob was saying they                                  don't know what to expect them so they                                  want to plan everything out but if you                                  can get a win then you're going to gain                                  some client trust and you'll have some                                  capital to work with especially                                  inexperienced buyers there's a book                                  called the Lean Startup by Eric Ries and                                  he talks about something called a                                  Minimum Viable Product you can build                                  rupal site almost the same way you can                                  take a feature a blog for example you                                  can make a simple blog using fields and                                  views and you can just have headlines                                  and pictures and now we still we editor                                  and you show the customer this is a blog                                  it took us two hours to build is this                                  what you did or do you need anything                                  else and it turns out this fancy blog                                  that there may be there advertising                                  agency come up with it's a real in a                                  sterile this simple blog with a bit of                                  theming will be delivery the action                                  business Val that will achieve what they                                  need to do it will be it will cover the                                  needs of that certain target group and                                  it will it will fulfill their needs in                                  terms of user experience it's very hard                                  to it's very hard to have an opinion                                  something you cannot try and if you can                                  build a prototype quickly grupo which we                                  can this replace an amazing prototype                                  meet all the customer can make the                                  decisions early on and they can decide                                  right away okay we're going to scrap                                  this requirements that is up they could                                  never do with with with a waterfall                                  that's something that agile                                  methodologies provides uniquely okay we                                  got another question here so how do you                                  deal with what seems to be a habitual                                  tendency for engineers to underestimate                                  the amount of time needed to deliver so                                  basically why are you engineers not                                  giving us numbers that are high enough                                  blame game again but you have some                                  pretty good thick thanks for that well I                                  think first of all having a risk                                  management discussion with your                                  engineering team is one way to make them                                  understand that everything is not                                  peaches and roses things are going to                                  happen things are going to go wrong and                                  you need to discuss that with them so                                  they think about the impact and you're                                  not just saying okay well I'm not very                                  comfortable with assessments i'm going                                  to add like                                                            I really screw up bad need to cover my                                  butt what you want to do instead is say                                  what is the actual impact what do I                                  think this might set me off and if I                                  don't know then maybe I should look into                                  it a little bit instead of going into it                                  blind and just saying I think I'm just                                  gonna slap on on these hours do a little                                  bit of testing do some prototyping get                                  some experience and find out even if                                  it's just you know for your own                                  knowledge you know what what is the                                  potential impact of this try and learn                                  something before you you take that leap                                  I think is the safest thing to do so                                  definitely discuss it with your team and                                  do some critical thinking instead of                                  just oh I don't know I'm scared that's                                  not going to help you in the end I think                                  the best advice I can give is sort of                                  bringing the team and customers close                                  together as possible don't be some proxy                                  between the customer and the team                                  estimation by proxy it's not a good idea                                  yeah also planning poker is a really                                  good good thing because when when we                                  started to work with planning poker the                                  estimates were more much more accurate                                  than before when we when we didn't work                                  with the planning poker so now we're                                  going to do planning poker tomorrow in                                  the buff if you want to see how it works                                  yeah if you haven't done it this is this                                  is the opportunity to try it with a                                  bunch of people who also are excited yay                                  um so are you saying the teams aren't                                  excited well now maybe they are not                                  raise your hand if you're excited to do                                  estimation okay well maybe half of you                                  are you need to come to the ball and                                  then you'll all be raising your hands                                  emphatically both of them that would be                                  chocolate will go buy some chocolate now                                  apparently there will be okay so how                                  about another question um pre-project                                  workshops are very helpful with more                                  accurate estimates but how can we help                                  the client understand that so basically                                  doing discovery before the project is                                  helpful how do we convince the client                                  that this needs to happen                                  Shannon to someone talks too much I can                                  but I'm hogging the mic it's bugging                                  them like look so it's a can you repeat                                  the question how can convince clients to                                  discovery well what we've been doing for                                  a long time at node                                                   been doing pilot studies we basically                                  what we call video we did a salute we do                                  that we'd suggested a solution almost                                  like a recipe and under the reason that                                  this the work we do here it's going to                                  be valuable to you regardless of turn to                                  us another agency essentially you're                                  going to be rode them for building your                                  site and Drupal and we're going to use                                  our expertise never figure out all the                                  all the traps and you know and the                                  pitfalls and everything in that would                                  pretty well in most cases in almost                                  every case that could turn to us about                                  the site but they delete we've got to                                  get a document from us which wasn't just                                  which was actually genuinely actually                                  had actual value for them so if you can                                  sell your discovery as that as a sort of                                  a a pilot study which will help them get                                  better prices and save money in the long                                  run then they will gladly pay for it but                                  it tastes take some sales work I think                                  it's a good idea to show some of the                                  work you've been doing for other clients                                  if it's possible because then it's much                                  easier to understand for a for a new                                  client or a potential client that oh                                  this this free project workshop can                                  really be you can get out so much                                  information from it and you can use it                                  either you choose to work with someone                                  else later or if you continue the                                  cooperation how many you use workshops                                  as a way to get to requirements in place                                  ok cool I think I think we're chips are                                  super super because the customer gets                                  involved too and if you can involve the                                  team even better not that that's a                                  advice piece of advice can give you more                                  workshops they can also use it for                                  marketing sometimes if they're if                                  they're doing that workshop and like                                  talking to users that's also a great                                  wait for them to gather information                                  directly from their base so there's lots                                  of avenues for marketing that you know                                  solution to                                  your client okay so another question any                                  preferred tools for risk management                                  during estimation I'm going to put                                  together some of the different resources                                  and give that information at the ball so                                  if you want them you have to come                                  tomorrow yes haha good our school                                  spreadsheets yes we've got some                                  spreadsheet so we'll share so um let's                                  see here what's another one that we can                                  ask so how do I manage the sales team                                  when they want me to reduce my estimate                                  sales is like no that's too high that's                                  out of their budget well it's like what                                  did I say to be addressed abuse it's                                  like a bus like you can't argue with the                                  weight of a bus a bus wait waits a                                  certain number of attacks and estimate                                  this a certain aside you can't negotiate                                  with it if you want it's like a                                  negotiation if they want the lower price                                  they got to give something else that                                  would be reduced to scope or something                                  ya like like you told me a great example                                  actually you had it do you rember what                                  you said before oh I remember I'm gonna                                  quote mattyas so he said basically that                                  you should only um you know negotiate                                  how much you're going to do negotiate in                                  the effort not on the on the actual                                  value of that effort so if if your team                                  is coming to you and saying you know                                     hours is too much forex feature then say                                  to your team okay how can we reduce the                                  effort necessary to produce X feature                                  instead of okay well I guess we'll just                                  knock off fifteen percent because we                                  need to come in under budget that's the                                  surest way to be wrong absolutely wrong                                  in your estimation and you know either                                  that's a risk that you're willing to                                  take as a you know shop for your client                                  we're going to accept the risk that                                  we're going to be probably you know                                  wrong on this estimate and then we're                                  going to eat that but I don't suggest                                  that solution I think it's better to go                                  back to go she ate with your client and                                  say this is a problem we need to reduce                                  scope because we think for XY reason                                  this is going to be too much effort for                                  what the value that you're talking about                                  so let's find a way to I                                  you know share the risk will do                                           free you do                                                          change the scope change the architecture                                  of the solution to make it simpler so                                  that it does fit into your scope or                                  maybe just go straight out to your                                  clients say look this isn't going to                                  work how would you like to handle it                                  because we don't want to take on the                                  risk of of this thing becoming giant and                                  having to fix it ourselves because                                  that's not fair to to us in our business                                  relationship an estimation is also not                                  just something you do the custom of the                                  customer can actually estimate the                                  distance value you can wonder like if a                                  project would bring them maybe                                       money something in terms of value maybe                                  there's not the smartest to have a                                  budget of a thousand to build that                                  project but if the ratio is more like                                  one to ten the project will build ten                                  thousand money something                                                  value in cost you a thousand to build                                  then it's a much easier equation so do                                  that math and wondering like like how                                  close do you want to cut it okay so                                  let's let's do one last question so this                                  one is how do you combine a requirement                                  for a fixed price with an agile                                  development planning approach so                                  basically how you do a j'you have a                                  fixed budget I think this is a really                                  really common situation in the buff that                                  I had yesterday we had this question as                                  well so thank you we tried this we've                                  been playing with different versions                                  here to try and get customers and sign                                  up to this and I would say don't I mean                                  I mean I like something's got it's okay                                  if you have a fixed budget then you get                                  have a fluid scope you can't have both                                  first and you can't poor quality then                                  it's not agile so be honest to yourself                                  like and get the customer to realize                                  that the importance is deliver the                                  things like they showed in the like I                                  showed in the quadrants before the                                  diagram there was a top left folks in                                  the ones that least effort more most                                  value first and then cut cut the not so                                  important stuff and that means if you                                  can't commit to the scope yeah your                                  client needs to understand that it's                                  give and take they cannot have all the                                  points of the triangle all the time if                                  they want to fix budget they're going to                                  have to be flexible                                  on other things and they need to agree                                  to this from day one if they don't then                                  I would say don't do the project because                                  you are going to really be hurting at                                  the end of that because you're going to                                  have to take on all of the risk of you                                  know building this thing that you you                                  have no control over because your client                                  is going to dictate your scope to you so                                  I've seen this happen and it's a really                                  tough time for the team I don't I don't                                  think you should do it if you can change                                  the fact that the scope is you know                                  unfixed or say okay but guess what for                                  this fixed budget you're only getting                                  our intern where you may take a hit on                                  quality but the work as much as you I I                                  don't want to be an intern at your                                  company it's an example of another way                                  if you have you know people that you're                                  bringing up in teaching maybe if you've                                  got this high-risk fixed budget project                                  you can bring in someone with less                                  experience who you know presents more                                  risks in the client say okay if you if                                  you don't are not going to pony up then                                  we are not going to you know take the                                  time from our best developers and put                                  all of our other projects at risk                                  because when one project goes in the red                                  and you have to you know try and save it                                  sometimes other projects can be affected                                  by that like we saw in the ABC you know                                  diagram so that that's probably answer                                  yeah I agree it's a it is a problem                                  because lots a lot of the tenders you                                  get you have to come with a fixed price                                  and at the same time a lot of companies                                  and organization wants work agile and                                  it's kind of a its kind of having a                                  twilight so now and and it have to be                                  you have to be clear about some of the                                  on the lowest prioritized stories are                                  are not going to happen in in the in the                                  project so that I don't think we have                                  time for any more questions well we have                                  more there are more questions two                                  answers have come to both tomorrow and                                  ask all you want yeah we're going to
