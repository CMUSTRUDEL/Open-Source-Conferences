of all to                                developers that have developed the nice                                iPad app will be showing today and show                                you how it we created it and we got the                                chap who's asking questions who's                                showing you kind of how this last one                                was working so I and a mobile developer                                who's building model website and ipad                                application yeah and first of all let me                                introduce very me garage with the main                                speaker here on this track and his idea                                relevance is also a really cool chief                                chef so um let's start                                so I've heard and that this mobile is                                saying that this kind of cool and I                                really no one to know why do I need to                                go mobile what do that getting me yeah                                there is a plenty of reasons why you can                                do it our first both you get a better                                user experience your site users will                                like it very much and that is why you                                get new visitors and you will also                                compete with other websites and one of                                the major reasons you really shoot to do                                it is that about fifty percent of                                traffic is going to be mobile by the                                                                                                       percent of traffic I singer by a new                                restaurant and have to calculate one                                moment over so I'm sold on that idea but                                how could my my site be mobile I mean I                                have a side it's a great website for                                seven obviously what else how could it                                be mobile wow I first of all it should                                look like a native iOS Android                                application and it also should to be                                optimized for mobile devices and you                                need to go to the App Store okay um this                                app store saying it sounds really nice i                                mean i would love to have it i would                                love to have this this drupal website in                                this film but as I imagined kind of a                                Drupal website is kind of big how does                                it fit in such a small phone and it                                tells whether complicated how much does                                it cost I can't spend some I have some                                budget but the elements well it's                                actually it is not difficult to do it it                                is actually very easy if you use Drupal                                phonegap and the mag module yeah let me                                give you a little rest perspective                                because this session is kind of                                follow-up session                                we had in denver in Emily first                                introduced the mobile app generator                                which is the acronym the mac is standing                                for and them as a bit to things that                                people by really asking for mobile app                                generators were later shall allows you                                to easily take a Drupal website and                                you'll click button and do some other                                things and it's a mobile app and but                                when Singh two things were kind of the                                most often asked questions and that was                                the first thing was well it's still                                looking like a Drupal website it's not a                                nap so how can we design things how can                                we seem things how can we make things                                happen but this mobile website is now                                more looking like a nap this kind of                                what will show in the first part and                                then we'll go more into the into the                                mobile app generator part where we will                                show some very cool thing because the                                other thing that people ask was well I                                can generate my app now I can have a nap                                I can update its to the App Store but                                it's too slow what really most people                                want it is in app updates and we got                                that and that's what we are also show                                later so you littles good but how could                                they make Drupal look like a native iOS                                or android app do you mean like this                                well uh wait amount let me let me see so                                so i got my kaiserschmarrn my apple                                strudel my lost part worcester and here                                also some vegetarian options bavarian                                snakes you know what do you think i                                 think this could work so really i tried                                 to make generator sing there in denver                                 am but what was not so good happening                                 was that I had some text and I couldn't                                 scroll                                 I tried miss one finger was two fingers                                 with three fingers in Miss five fingers                                 just didn't work so how can he make this                                 I spoiled for bus yeah I do this one                                 so yep that looks about right I like                                 this you like this to wait so I have                                 used i scroll library written by                                 material Spinelli you could download it                                 on the website kubik that org slash i                                 scroll it is very nice library and                                 here's what you need to do you need to                                 do you need to add couple of divs a                                 positive is a rapper the determines the                                 size of the scroller and the second is a                                 scroller content area which contains                                 some content samuele a text and whenever                                 and also you need to add some see simple                                 CSS for the rapper where position                                 relative is actually some CSS tweak and                                 that indexes like making it to be on the                                 lower comparing to other objects and you                                 also may set of wheels but it's actually                                 optional parameter and the height and                                 you can set our flow which could be                                 alter or scroll and actually to skip                                 this parameter land will it will work                                 well and if you want like to make                                 experimenting with the horizontal or                                 vertical scroll bars you could use                                 aeroflow dash X and overflow dash Y and                                 what else you need to do is to in the                                 javascript file you need to add a new                                 behavior and attach the functions that                                 will find all unprocessed scroll divs                                 and will initialize create new scroll                                 object and will store it in the data so                                 it's used because if you using some kind                                 of jquery to show in high elements                                 I scroll works only for the objects that                                 I shown the page so every time you are                                 showing or changing Adam you need to                                 trigger a Drupal behavior to enable and                                 refresh all existent i scroll objects                                 there yet just to explain this a little                                 more um now in my role as developer of                                 that we first had a little different                                 approach but it turned out to be not as                                 well so um really the thing is this is a                                 Drupal way to do things you're really                                 using the usual Drupal behaviors and                                 then we are just storing the data here                                 in the in the object where we edit the                                 ice pole on and the reason is that                                 whenever you are now showing something                                 you just select Drupal attach behaviors                                 and then this gets called again so we                                 didn't show this kind of for complexity                                 but the only thing you need to do is you                                 have to kind of at the same code like                                    squared protest dot each you are just                                 doing this the data i scroll dot refresh                                 and that's all you need to do and then                                 you have it working nicely with within                                 the drupal framework it will also work                                 for a jake salaban's really nice hope                                 so this was good with this robust I                                 really liked this carousel but how can I                                 quit it and can I just add new slides so                                 yeah actually you can add new slides the                                 slides is a note and this is a view and                                 it supports the touch input from your                                 mobile device from the ipad exist and to                                 do it you need to use roundabout jquery                                 plugin by Fred LeBlanc and use around                                 the belt model by Alex mayor Phillips                                 Meyer and to make it happen you need to                                 install views around the bell jquery                                 update modules and roundabouts plugin                                 also you may need to install event drug                                 and you can drop plugin that you could                                 download from treetop Mediacom it is                                 needed for a touch support and you may                                 also want to create a bu page and a view                                 blog and set roundabout format feet and                                 enable dragon in the settings or so this                                 so this is all nice and good bit I think                                 when the app starts I would like to                                 introduce the user to the app and i                                 would like to also have like a little                                 info where user can touch and then he                                 can see some information about this app                                 so to understand it better yeah heroes                                 example of the pop-up of the model                                 dialogue and there is plenty of models                                 in the drupal the torque and lots of                                 JavaScript plugins that allow us to do                                 dialogue but it's actually they are not                                 very convenient to use                                 run the JavaScript you could do it they                                 are perfectly integrated with some other                                 Drupal modules but what I've found is                                 was simple model it's jquery plugin                                 written by eric martin and it's actually                                 not a drupal model yet but it is very                                 easy to use so you need to do like this                                 select the proper element that you want                                 to show us the content in the dialog                                 using jquery and run model method and                                 also you may want to use your own HTML                                 to be shown there and if you want to add                                 some animations like fading and find out                                 what you need to do is run this with                                 special parameter on open which actually                                 contains a function which will fade in                                 the early and fading them container and                                 then shove the data you could use this                                 snippet I like this simple model very                                 much and it has very nice features like                                 you could manually automatically resize                                 and position your dialogue it supports                                 model and no model modes you can control                                 overlay pacity and youth show and hide                                 animations it's very cool i hope it will                                 be integrated with some drupal model                                 like a dialogue api or something like                                 this you strive so so far we got a                                 carousel we got a nice scroll bars i got                                 some pdfs way people can download my                                 menu they can look at it and it's all                                 drupal views I like that it's very                                 extendable but I really need a detailed                                 page so that I can can just select                                 something from the menu at the top and                                 then I want to show the history you know                                 in my restaurant we are only having                                 meals that are certified by Wikipedia                                 like this there's nice transitions                                 between the males                                 Oh                                 that looks good cool so doing something                                 like this like a little scrolling etc                                 it's very easy there's two plugins to                                 use for that there's a local scroll and                                 the scroll to plug in and it's very easy                                 usable you just have a normal container                                 like Ephesus cool bar and then you have                                 just the usual H name angels or for the                                 diffs you have angels you can just use                                 the href and it will automatically                                 scroll their score to is very very                                 powerful because you can even have a                                 grid and you can scroll this in that                                 quit wherever you want and it was all                                 working really nice yeah it was working                                 really nice and then I so when there was                                 a lot of slides and it started to work                                 extremely slugsy iPad what was heaven is                                 there any way to make some hardware                                 acceleration yeah what was happening was                                 it was working on the iPad then and we                                 were just looking at it and in a                                 sluggish it didn't look nice also the                                 carousel after some were trying and some                                 rning was also sluggish and the reason                                 is that all of this was using the usual                                 jQuery animations and we really support                                 an initial tests had shown that it                                 should have worked that the ipad was                                 powerful enough just to calculate the                                 animations better turn out it is not and                                 so we had a little problem because the                                 client was our client here's a chef is                                 now really very it well what about my                                 budget do I have to redo all of this                                 animations again do we have to create a                                 new roundabout pack in with css                                  animations unfortunately it turned out                                 nope there's a very very very very and I                                 could at hundreds of                                 is more cool library which is called                                 jQuery trended who knows it one or two                                 okay this library allows you to use your                                 normal animate functionality that you                                 are used to from jQuery animations and                                 it will automatically translate those                                 into series of sweet properties that                                 means with just very very little code                                 change usually it's just to exchange any                                 made through transition you'll be able                                 to write CSS three animated things and                                 that's really cool because css                                  animations are nice and but I still                                 found them like it little difficult to                                 use and I'm so used to the jQuery                                 animate way and there are also lots of                                 third-party libraries kind of depending                                 on this end it turned out that you can                                 really just just exchange things easily                                 so how we did solve it for the was the                                 scrolling of the menu and the reason why                                 it was slow was a big background images                                 because the more big as background                                 images got the slower it got and also                                 what was happening is from the                                 background images we once had position                                 fixed instead of squirrel you can't                                 believe how slow with God and when we                                 got back to position scroll it worked                                 better and then we had scaled the                                 background image because CSS allows you                                 to do that also yeah and the last level                                 then when we just did an image cache and                                 youth the right and also the Esperance                                 he was changed their so well there was a                                 semi-transparent slides that was touring                                 and the opposite he was changing and the                                 transition really helped us to make it                                 work very fast yeah the transparent with                                 us a problem so um what it's very easy                                 to use as I said so what we're just                                 doing we are calculating the new X                                 offset and with jquery trends that                                 allows us it gives a new property to CSS                                 so instead of changing the                                 left property you're changing a new X                                 property and this X property directly                                 maps to the transition property at                                 translation property also CSS way and                                 that way it's very very easy and we now                                 had two cases now go back we now had two                                 cases one any main case and one                                 non-animated case and it turned out that                                 you can just use the same code because                                 if you were always animating what would                                 happen is people would click on it from                                 the main screen and then it would just                                 school there and people were like                                 confused what is happening there                                 continue you can grow your head so you                                 might ask yourself kind of because the                                 promise is no session description or                                 because you're curious what additional                                 modules can be used for going moombah                                 but other things can you use to make                                 your mobile experience more rewarding                                 what we have a mobile site at all so                                 there is it two big categories of the                                 models one you need for the mobile                                 website while other you need was a                                 mobile app let's consider their mobile                                 website models first so there is a                                 mobile tools model which actually has a                                 lots of functions it allows to detect                                 the user device using browser cap and                                 provide contextual switching of the                                 content the layout it could also do                                 automatically direction to the site                                 based on a specific device group like if                                 you have an mobile a smartphone you are                                 directly on the one side if you have a                                 tablet your direct it on the other side                                 and if you use just bc you are using the                                 main side and this model also supports                                 spaces and it features and there is a                                 mobile bookmark pop-up and much more but                                 it's pretty complicated and then how can                                 we in size shell that it's not better to                                 use this model if you saw the Acquia dev                                 cloud demo that was like him if this                                 model is installed                                 I give you minus                                                    something like this because it's a                                 problem of vacation and so you could use                                 simple alternatives like a model same as                                 switch sim and models which is which do                                 actually the same with addition of them                                 use of simple model resurrect module so                                 the problem fication was if you're                                 having a single website with the same                                 URL for different devices and you have                                 lots of visitors you may want to cache                                 the content but actually you could not                                 do it because for the different group of                                 device you probably have a different                                 content different a bit different blocks                                 a bit different CSS and some other kind                                 of stuff so what you need to do is do                                 tech device and resurrect it the                                 specific website that as a specification                                 configuration for this group of devices                                 and this is possible to do with it with                                 these models em but still you might have                                 a need for example that you have a site                                 and it has now a mobile context and                                 you've set up everything correctly that                                 you're showing kind of some things on                                 the one device the other thing on the                                 other and you're having a redirect to                                 your mobile website there no no next one                                 next slide I'm talking about mobile                                 context context mobile detect yeah I do                                 um okay so what was happening was that                                 there was a big transition day and                                 people by like coming to the side and                                 they were just totally confused because                                 they were used to the normal side it was                                 working on the mobile device and now                                 they get redirected to another side and                                 it was looking completely different so                                 I'm what the client at that time want to                                 do was to just show a little message box                                 and for this we get this                                 little project conducts mobile detect                                 written by Adam here in the front and                                 this allows to do that but connect                                 mobile detect is depending on something                                 else that's quite cool and that's also                                 by browse kept is not a good solution in                                 that where you really want to do the                                 mobile detection is in your first pair                                 of caching and that for most                                 high-performance sides would be varnish                                 so there's a possibility to set up some                                 device detects dot vcl it's called you                                 can easily google it and then it will                                 just give sweep options to the Drupal                                 site and this will be pc tablet or                                 mobile and based on this you can show                                 different blocks so and this is because                                 it's kind of working this environment                                 completely comfortable with the other                                 approach and then you can also do some                                 redirections there etc so it's highly                                 recommended for this combination also                                 use the browser cap block and a browser                                 cap CTools browser cab blocked module                                 almost do the same for the its adds some                                 settings configuration to the default                                 blocks of Drupal if you are not using                                 context and the browser kept CTools add                                 some conditions and contexts to the page                                 manager module which could be used                                 actually in the panels and then creating                                 your own pages to detect device based on                                 specific group and there is also some                                 kind of useful models like a laser                                 loading module so if you are viewing a                                 big website on the smartphone you                                 probably not often use Wi-Fi you may use                                 a                                                                     and some kind of edge technology so you                                 don't want to all site to load and all                                 images to be loaded so you could                                 actually use image lazy loader module                                 which will show on these the images for                                 the specific area your site users of you                                 and the same happens with the block                                 laser loader which                                 lots of block for this area then here is                                 the doors view um just to give you an                                 idea of how this is working let's say we                                 got an image way down the fold so this                                 is a scroll bar here's a fold this is                                 our image if you're just looking at this                                 why should we load that image there's no                                 need to sew but when the users quotes                                 down down down here we're coming near                                 the image so quickly we load it and once                                 the user camps he sees it so there's no                                 problem with the user experience usually                                 and you just really appreciate it                                 because if you don't have to load like                                                                                                     faster and that gives you a better user                                 experience oh it starts and the mobile                                 app there are several models that you                                 could use for the model application one                                 of them is a smart up banners that is                                 used for your mobile website if you are                                 viewing your website from the mobile                                 device so you may want to view on the                                 Android or iOS use your native                                 application so this model shows nice                                 welcome a banner to install then you're                                 a pet over android application it takes                                 the user device based on the group and                                 it also detects if they're a business                                 doubt and a few generation of this could                                 maintain context as poss and parameters                                 to the mobile application there is also                                 model push notifications and push                                 notification is I think really cool and                                 something you need in that we worked                                 hard and push notification support for                                 this app it works The Verge                                 notifications module allows you just to                                 to send push notifications directly to                                 Apple to google for android etc so you                                 can sensors but you will still need                                 something else just to receive the push                                 notification for server but their server                                 server modules they can just help you                                 there but this makes it really easy to                                 send out the push notifications for                                 this mobile app we actually ended up                                 using a worship and that probably also                                 put the mobile app generator will                                 support kind of out of box they have a                                 free plan that I don't know millions of                                 messages and that's probably sufficient                                 enough and it was easier to use in that                                 context but we evaluate push                                 notifications was working great oh add                                 some some description for the push                                 notifications so if you like using the                                 client server technology the only client                                 could initiate connections so if you                                 want to get update automatically from                                 the server using the client server                                 technology you need to print server and                                 then get some results but imagine if all                                 your applications will do it in the same                                 time you probably get lost lots of                                 traffic and this is not needed the push                                 notification allows server to be my                                 client yes what we need to when we are                                 want to say you know that there is some                                 useless some new item since many you you                                 want to show you want to see it and                                 updated yeah obviously what's also                                 happening if the user is not actually                                 using you app give no way of informing                                 them well there's a new slide available                                 check out the new meal come to a                                 restaurant what about visiting today                                 Friday night and really want to do this                                 for marketing purposes so what do you                                 want to do is send those push                                 notifications as kind of in app updates                                 and out besides about dates and if you                                 own an iPhone or something you will                                 surely know this little batch there                                 which is just incrementing when new push                                 notifications are received and was                                 looking yeah and now I know yes we want                                 to present you a special module from the                                 Fabian are you prepared for it welcome                                 model AB generator Mario and you might                                 know it already because the demo session                                 is linked but we are present you the new                                 version of the mobile app generator and                                 as many many new features but for the                                 that don't know it yet you really have                                 your drupal site you select some pages                                 you want to export inside of a menu or                                 they're so far also some patches for                                 other approaches you take this batch put                                 it for example in zip file then you                                 translate it to your machine where you                                 are developing for your iOS application                                 or even you can use something else I                                 come to later and then you put in this                                 zip file and you create your mobile app                                 asset and that really makes it very very                                 easy for everyone to create a mobile app                                 it's not just that you need special                                 knowledge or something but you can do it                                 and really the new things are we have                                 this inept synchronization support we                                 get as a support of pushing to an                                 external server we get the push                                 notifications via humor ship and a lot                                 of other cool stuff so it's really                                 really too easy to use another thing                                 that was kind of limitation still in the                                 end mobiles you would need to switch                                 your theme first it's no longer                                 necessary you can just just select you                                 seem you want to export so you can even                                 have a mobile app on your main website                                 and have some content so you don't have                                 to create a placate content this is how                                 it works yeah keeping our usual mobile                                 app you've seen already you can go to                                 some slides etc and then at the top this                                 admin menu and probably too difficult to                                 see but there's a mobile app generator                                 and generate mobile app and they're                                 different settings you can use first of                                 all this setting for the past and we are                                 pushing this to s                                                   select which menu to export and what's                                 new is there's a version number so all                                 what you are pushing is versioned that                                 means if user is a one version they can                                 still update you a new one but there is                                 no conflict and if you now generate it                                 we're just pushing everything up to                                 sweet and once you put a new version the                                 client will now we see a little later                                 and can then download the update but                                 strict that looks really cool but what                                 is it for gap and how it could be                                 cooking so Android let me ask hope you                                 know found gap orchid over some but not                                 all so forget is something orchid over                                 what is now called something that's                                 making it possible to use kind of web                                 application that you're creating and if                                 you're creating this with mobile app                                 generator or by hand it's not really                                 such important so I think the mobile app                                 generator obviously is a little easier                                 but what you can do is you can run this                                 code native for example on an iPhone on                                 an android on a windows mobile and                                 really would phonegap allows you is what                                 you can do if you're just running from a                                 website is to access all of the devices                                 native functionality for example you                                 could check and that's what we did for                                 those app if a video if the app is                                 running in sweegee so just having a slow                                 network connection or if it's on the                                 vilas or if it's having no network at                                 all and depending on that you could for                                 example show videos which are inside of                                 the app and browser small but if say on                                 a Wi-Fi you don't want this more videos                                 but you rather want to have some a                                 pop-up where they can see the videos                                 from youtube or some other service like                                 Brightcove and you can just omit the                                 code and again it's just tubal                                 programming so you all can do this you                                 all can do create mobile apps and you do                                 not even need to own all of this SDKs                                 because there's a phone gap cloud or                                 cordova cloud ever get build service and                                 they can just upload a git repository of                                 your files and it will automatically                                 kind of                                 read your files there so finger cloud is                                 to say this commercial but you get one                                 app for free and if you are not selling                                 this if if your code is not proprietary                                 but you can kind of have it like a                                 public repository then you get more apps                                 free yeah if your support was a good                                 yeah this is kind of the device matrix                                 of phonegap so it supports a lot of                                 operating systems it allows you to                                 notification vibration storage storage                                 is very needed for this module so we can                                 do the in app updates you can select the                                 network can do a photo with the camera                                 and upload it is media have a comp ass                                 and they're really fun and probably the                                 future version of it will can do like a                                 cooking serving and some other kind of                                 stuff and so I didn't want to go into                                 too much detail now on phonegap because                                 we have a limited space here but i                                 rather encourage you if you have not yet                                 done so to check out the session from                                 denver it's linked from the session                                 description from here and you'll have                                 some fun I assure you that and you'll                                 learn everything about phonegap oh cool                                 and how does it all can work together so                                 it all works together there was kind of                                 how it was working in in Denver still we                                 have the mobile app generator generate                                 the app put it on the phone done yeah so                                 I would make I want to update like for                                 example if I want to update menu what I                                 need to do yeah what you would have                                 needed to do is you would need to                                 generate a new mobile app put in the new                                 folder push the update we're at the                                 apple store and have users download it                                 manually through the apple store but you                                 know if you just want to promote                                 something that's yeah putting a whole                                 update just because you want to promote                                 your party tonight is probably not what                                 you want another possibility was like                                 services                                 you can do this you can just set up your                                 Drupal sites to connect to the server so                                 certain things in your mobile app need                                 always network connectivity that's                                 working this out problems so can really                                 use all your skills you have in terms of                                 services in mobile etc here as long as                                 it works in the browser it will mostly                                 work on the phone with some little                                 exceptions but still there was not                                 enough because they say well we really                                 like it that you don't need a network                                 but we still want to push updates when                                 users are online and this is kind of how                                 it's working so you generate the mobile                                 app you then pushing the mobile app to                                 Amazon asleep or another cloud service                                 that allows you to download via HTTP yes                                 for example because we are expecting                                 quite some traffic for the application                                 which is still a little secret you could                                 use for example the Amazon CloudFront                                 service which would then allow you to                                 kind of have it really fast everywhere                                 on the world but here we have this                                 Amazon s                                                              from it and it's like working like an                                 awesome synchronization so there's an                                 md                                                                      are really transferred so you don't have                                 problems with like big downloads after                                 you've initially think so and how it's                                 working if the app is when the episode                                 is spring for the push notifications is                                 also doing a very little ping to the s                                  and checking is there a new version                                 available and if yes then it says okay                                 let's prompt the user and download it so                                 periodically we check if there's new                                 version and the best event do this is to                                 check when the device gets ready                                 phonegap has the device on an event on                                 device ready and we're using that that's                                 mostly the best because when the user                                 starts up the app or resumes your app                                 you'll be able to kind of check if                                 there's an update available obviously                                 only if you have network so and another                                 event then obviously is                                 when the network gets available so let's                                 say the users on the train as half no                                 network but then get into a region where                                 he has network again epp can see oh                                 there's an update available and prompt                                 the user so and then it's download to                                 the iphone again and initially once you                                 need to do this mr. JavaScript app and                                 so you once exported to zip do it like                                 normal like in Denver and then you can                                 synchronize began it again again as                                 often as you want and this is now it's                                 working with push notifications very                                 easy you're just standing push                                 notification to the iphone the                                 JavaScript app is prompting the user                                 again the user can download this is                                 really like well we pushed an update                                 there's a party in three weeks come                                 check it out so just adding new slides                                 right and then run this module yeah and                                 then it automatically will send to the                                 Amazon s                                                              just the s                                                          notification is standing automatically                                 to the mobile device yeah and it's kind                                 of very easy to make updates but what                                 you really need to be armed yes ok so                                 let's summarize what we need to do so                                 the Drupal website can go to the App                                 Store first of all you need to create                                 your application seam and use such kind                                 of scrapes and plugins such i scroll                                 roundabout

slide                                 please thanks a lot but before we get to                                 that as I already said you once exported                                 we are public for example Mac take this                                 put it in phonegap and then afterwards                                 you just push to s                                                   this case it's relying on the Avs amazon                                 module and on the s we I'm fired back                                 end module but if you have a crazy                                 service or you need it for Akamai or                                 something and you have a Drupal                                 connector so everywhere where drupal can                                 send its fires but ruble can write files                                 to you can use it with mobile app                                 generator so then you compile code into                                 a native application using phonegap and                                 if you're using this organization                                 support there's a little change from                                 Denver here you putting your app into                                 the ww static directory and the Lord of                                 the mech extras to the www directory the                                 reason is if you have the loader and                                 there's a problem with the files for                                 example the download is corrupted you                                 don't want to have to break you just                                 want to download it again with the last                                 stable version that was okay and so                                 there's this lauder that's just checking                                 that everything is still fine from the                                 Downloads safety measures so then you're                                 updating your content obviously you have                                 lots to say and you pushed you new                                 update for your mac and but just one                                 caveat you can update java script via                                 that because it included in your app                                 obviously but if you push bad JavaScript                                 you can under certain circumstances                                 break the downloader in such break the                                 in app update functionality so I                                 wouldn't                                 push to have a script via the content                                 updates service I would really do a new                                 release on the app store then another                                 nice thing is what you could do you                                 could just you have your app like                                       so it still fits into downloadable vs                                    and then you can push more content when                                 the users on a by five so you can have a                                 very slick application on the App Store                                 and then just get on more content when                                 needed yeah it's cool and also you need                                 to it's better to install smart head

this is kind of a pop-up the starting up                                 at the beginning we invite you you'll                                 probably also just publish it so it's                                 online later with blog post and then you                                 can click you can drag just take a                                 little yeah you're semi half you your                                 orders here has little boxes we can                                 upload download content or your school                                 bus everywhere the menu at the bottom                                 yeah there you have your resume to you                                 okay there's still bunk beds oh yeah                                 here's me I mean that's it can't happen                                 obviously you don't get this markings                                 when you're actually on an iPad here and                                 the menu doesn't like us today so we                                 probably do it without don't download it                                 again to show a little more for dragging                                 the carousels very nice you can drag it                                 with with your hand or in this case with                                 the mouse um yeah it's actually working                                 okay if you are doing its touch screen                                 yeah so                                 we really have some more time here I                                 can't believe there are no more                                 questions you can ask everything about                                 mobile it doesn't even need to be                                 totally to this session yeah you're                                 welcome yeah                                 it is not yet available that's why we                                 are showing you the Bavarian restaurant                                 instead because we were thinking like oh                                 it's not yet out it would be a very                                 difficult thing to sell the branding                                 it's currently in submission process so                                 we are sitting in the restaurant there                                 at the pollen and we were just seeing                                 what could we do and we were eating like                                 Bavarian food and suddenly we got what                                 we'll do a restaurant yeah okay so the                                 question was if you're setting up your                                 mobile apps in your mobile app and this                                 mobile app should have commerce                                 integration that means that you can                                 publish things can purchase things and                                 you need to take care of all that                                 security so what in this case I would do                                 I would kind of do a link between the                                 application that's running here on the                                 phone and your vet aside because for all                                 of this processing they usually need to                                 be online anyway so what you can do is I                                 would just forward them to your website                                 and do the purchase there I mean you                                 could obviously do all of that kind of                                 in-app then you could either use some                                 native como el things because with                                 phonegap it's very easy kind of to                                 excess native functionality I've written                                 two or three plugins which will also                                 publish with that that are kind of                                 allowing little things and nice                                 functionality here for example we've not                                 shown that but the pdfs for the menu we                                 don't have any pdfs here now allowing to                                 have a little child browser which is                                 coming up which is like a very nice                                 ebook reader and this little sad thing                                 but i guess when the app is out we'll                                 talk a little more about it in the blog                                 post time yeah so I think you also need                                 to make you can use it you can make it                                 different ways maybe with a service                                 module or backbone GS and what you also                                 can do is just here like embed some real                                 HTML from your website to be shown on                                 their mobile app but it should be doing                                 secures I'll use some tokens and some                                 authorization some kind of stuff like                                 this yeah further questions please and                                 can we have also input forms in not log                                 in but the for example that you go to                                 page one page free with the iphone iOS                                 formative I did get the question could                                 you please repeat yeah yeah sometimes                                 you have to selector in html                                            content is it possible as well yes it                                 should be possible I do think that                                 kotoba has clipboard support at least                                 the WebKit hair so you have say usual                                 JavaScript functionality available so um                                 yes WebKit has support for the clipboard                                 as you have access to the JavaScript you                                 can program it but mobile app generator                                 or something won't get you had something                                 like that he would custom code that and                                 I are the plans for order or the jQuery                                 tools you mentioned to to create a                                 beautiful module for that we are                                 thinking about it I still have to supply                                 the patch for the roundabout because                                 round about before was not working                                 really good because kind of the text was                                 residing with normal JavaScript and when                                 we just changed this to jquery translate                                 it was like this smooth that it's really                                 it's really hard for accelerated resized                                 and bed worked much better so I don't                                 think we have so many plans yet but very                                 miss a big Drupal contributor has also                                 working on core etc so he's probably                                 wanted to fulfill your wish at some time                                 in the future say to say if you have any                                 ideas any budgets you can submit welcome                                 it and you'll get the list of the one of                                 the commuters to the mag model so you're                                 welcome yeah but I'm I think you're                                 right it would probably make sense just                                 to just to put those libraries that are                                 not yet having Drupal projects us into                                 little Viper set up along this                                 functionality to be used a little more                                 easier than having to work with all of                                 that there's a question please say with                                 number                                 yeah there was a device detection module                                  that the blue you are FL so is that                                  needed in this scenario now as the                                  device detection module was really only                                  needed for your normal mobile website I                                  mean for people not using your app and                                  that's kind of the beauty of it you                                  could for example have a normal website                                  with a responsive same or an extra                                  mobile theme and then you have certain                                  pages that you want to export to your                                  mobile app that you want to have always                                  available we want other pages that                                  should linked to user to the website                                  experience so you can mix it all up and                                  then you just have to select the right                                  pages to export in those pages that are                                  not exported be directly linked to link                                  the user back to your completely mobile                                  website and that way you can very easily                                  connect the best of the mobile world                                  that's the best of what you are doing                                  currently kind of it with your mobile                                  website anyway thanks sure hi are there                                  any options for mobile caching so for                                  instance you have a news website which                                  need an internet connection to fetch                                  news items you can read it in the subway                                  or whatever this is possible what I mean                                  with Mac now you could just extend it a                                  little I mean we can also export files                                  really every file you want to have                                  exported you only need to do fire safe                                  pass on it as soon as you do this                                  sometime somewhere in the page                                  generation code what will happen is is                                  that it's very easily possible and to                                  export any content so what I would do in                                  that case is ever take services I would                                  statically take the JSON from the                                  services and I would save this with a                                  mobile app generator and then would Lord                                  this JSON so if you've got an update to                                  push in your news items we would just                                  push this JSON file and your application                                  would Lord the new days and things                                  without having to be online and you get                                  automatic part                                  Ching through this content publication                                  service good thank you we can take any                                  gracious more yep                                  hmm I think dusty fall application                                  should be designed by good design or so                                  say they have a special design                                  guidelines how to do it and it really I                                  need to be looking like is application                                  so the process of the submitting is very                                  long Teddy and could tell you a bit more                                  about it yep and so if you want to                                  publish to the app store especially                                  Apple has some guidelines to follow                                  that's true Android and other platforms                                  are usually a bit more light on that so                                  probably it's the most difficult to get                                  into App Store but according to the                                  amount of Cordova apps that are on the                                  App Store many of them having in up in                                  update functionality I'm not assuming                                  any problems there so the question was                                  how hard is the application process for                                  App Store and what guidelines need to be                                  followed further questions please anyone                                  yep yep                                  so the question was if there's a better                                  user experience to switch theme or to                                  have responsive design the answer is as                                  always it depends if responsive design                                  can work very well if you are kind of                                  not willing to change your content but                                  you're just kind of so your copy remains                                  the same but you want to still give the                                  user a different experience and you want                                  to hide some blocks that are really not                                  necessary on a mobile experience you                                  also want to lighten the load a lot in                                  that obviously usable to download this                                  blocks because just responsive and                                  you're just hiding or reordering etc on                                  the other hand and if you're creating a                                  true mobile same you can obviously                                  optimize it very much so with most                                  people end up doing is if they're doing                                  a true mobile seemeth that they are also                                  using custom copy for that so this is                                  custom copy you will have not only the                                  user experience from the design Taylor                                  to the user of a mobile device but also                                  the content copy and that's kind of what                                  i would say in that respect last                                  question your chance to get an answer                                  for me or for me yeah                                  time

     never guess yeah come on take the survey                                  rate the session                                  I hope you enjoyed it yeah thank you for
