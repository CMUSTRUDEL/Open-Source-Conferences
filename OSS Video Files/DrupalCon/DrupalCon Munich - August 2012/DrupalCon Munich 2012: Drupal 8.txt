	                              all right i think i should start hey                               everyone so I didn't make slides for                               this session because i felt like it                               already you know spoken about hey Angie                               I've reserved the chair for you you're                               in you're in good company though so if                               Angie and then catch my two kome ain't a                               nurse for Drupal                                                   pull them in you know if you guys are                                cool with that so again I've no slides                                for this session because I've already                                spoken about Drupal                                                there's been sessions by each of the                                initiative leads you know Angie just did                                a session on Drupal                                                 like we've talked about Drupal                                        and so I didn't want to like you know                                talk about it again you know in a formal                                manner and instead I wanted to make the                                real conversation because it's a core                                conversation is the name of the track                                and so there's a few things I didn't                                want to say but I very much hope that                                people have questions for the three of                                us or for me or for other people in the                                audience and I you know talk about                                things which are on your minds and let's                                see how it goes so before I start I                                wanted to maybe do a quick brain dump                                about how I'm feeling you know and so                                I'm feeling really well and yeah and I                                think every Drupal development cycle                                goes through phases like in the                                beginning of a Drupal development cycle                                people are very nervous because nothing                                seems to happen it's like why is nobody                                working on code and realities most                                people are still upgraded their modules                                and so there is this angst but slowly                                but certainly that starts to change and                                anthem of development starts to pick up                                and so right now it feels like you know                                there's quite a bit of momentum you know                                big patches are being submitted lots of                                people are working on things and so you                                know a lot of great things are happening                                and that's because we're getting closer                                and closer through the you know code                                freeze date and because people are                                finally you know moving away from you                                know upgrading their modules the Drupal                                                                                                      about what they want to do around Drupal                                                                                                        the momentum I'm also very happy with                                the issue queue and the way the issue                                queue is being managed and you know big                                kudos to catch and not not only for not                                only for coming up with the you know                                with our new system of there being                                thresholds right for criticals and major                                bugs but also for you know managing the                                issue queue so well and you know Angie                                and others as well so I feel really good                                about that however there's things that                                I'm worried about which I'll talk about                                in a second but but I do want to tell                                you between now and the next drupalcon                                we may feel different because what's                                going to happen right now is you know                                there's going to be more attention about                                getting things done before the code                                freeze date and that makes people a                                little anxious and because they're a                                little anxious you know the mood may                                change a little bit and that's what has                                happened historically and so I just                                wanted to give people a heads up that                                that may happen and I think we should                                maybe maybe we can discuss this in this                                session you know is there things that we                                can do Proactiv you know in a proactive                                way to not only recognize that that is                                going to happen but are there things you                                can do now while we're in happy zone                                that could prevent some of that you know                                stress and tension before the code                                freeze day to to be less or maybe you                                know even go away so that's an                                interesting thing I think and it's a                                challenge to all of you to think a                                little bit about that I mean                                we make some suggestions it's gonna it's                                going to happen because I'm now in a                                position where I need to start saying no                                more often right so in the beginning of                                the freeze of that development cycle                                everything pretty much goes like yep                                great idea let's do this and let's do                                 this but now we're slowly getting to a                                 point where we need to be a little bit                                 more restrictive as what we can still                                 start like if there's a giant initiative                                 that somebody wants to do well we need                                 to carefully consider if it's still you                                 know a good idea to do it at this stage                                 because chances are we will not get it                                 on it also all right so that's one thing                                 the other thing is even with regards to                                 the existing initiatives right I think                                 engine yours your presentation you                                 showed you know here's what we were                                 planning to do here's how much we                                 actually got done and here is how much                                 you still need to do and we actually                                 need to do a lot of work there's a lot                                 of work left and so that means that you                                 know me and catch and Angie and other                                 people need to start saying no a little                                 bit more and that we need to think about                                 what is a straight line from where we                                 are today to you know getting something                                 gone by the end of the code trees and                                 sometimes we tend to go like this right                                 or you know we can do this and we can do                                 this and so I think we need to start                                 saying no to some of these things and                                 here's one example and it's just an                                 example I don't necessarily want to call                                 it out but the annotations patch that                                 went in great work I love annotations                                 I've used them extensively in the past                                 but technically speaking it's something                                 which wasn't strictly necessary to do                                 the things that we wanted to do we could                                 have kept using info hoops for you know                                 another release and so these are the                                 kind of things that we need to carefully                                 take in mind because the annotation                                 patch took quite a bit of time you know                                 several weeks I think three weeks or so                                 of work and it took a lot of                                 different people to review it to provide                                 feedback and so it's actually taking                                 away a lot of our time and attention                                 from other things which we could be                                 doing which arguably could be considered                                 to be in the critical path to say                                 getting you know the symphony stuff in                                 or getting web services completed and so                                 one of the things I'll have to do more                                 and more of as we get closer is to be                                 more critical about these kinds of                                 features if we monitor if we want to                                 manage towards this code free state now                                 the big thing here is that I cannot do                                 that alone neither good you know web                                 check ketchin i do this alone it's                                 really if we want to scale as a                                 community we all need to be critical                                 about these things and we all need to                                 help say no through these things because                                 I can go around and look at all of these                                 issues and you know figure out if this                                 really necessary where is it's nice to                                 have and and so this is kind of a call                                 to action to all of you people working                                 on on you know core to be critical about                                 the things that we are working on and                                 it's I know it's difficult in a                                 community where people work on things                                 that they're passionate about them we                                 can't really tell people what they work                                 on and what not but we just need to be                                 smart about it or we're going to have a                                 lot of stress and tension towards the                                 end of the co trees in the feature                                 freeze right because people are going to                                 say well we have all of these work left                                 to do and so I think if we can try to                                 avoid that that would be great all right                                 so another thing that I'm worried about                                 is performance you know we're adding a                                 lot of things to core and it may affect                                 how fast we can surf pages at the same                                 time I was talking to chicks is he here                                 I don't know                                 oh you were hiding that's a chick's came                                 to me yesterday was all excited and he's                                 you know we all know chicks when he's                                 excited right we all we all liked it but                                 it was all excited but in it was very                                 positive in a sense but like you know                                 the issue with the issue queue is really                                 well managed and he's like so what will                                 we do between the code freeze and the                                 actual in a release date that we put                                 forward because he's like well there's                                 only                                                                   in a month and then we have like five                                 months left he said is that true chicks                                 do we have that on the records and so                                 you know me and I think there's a lot of                                 true I mean I don't think that's going                                 to happen that's what I told him I think                                 there's a lot of things we needed to                                 work on and you know hopefully we'll be                                 in a better situation than we were                                 before you know before we had like over                                 a hundred critical books but hopefully                                 that will give us more time to work on                                 performance as well right so so                                 performance is something that I'm                                 worried about are there things you guys                                 are worried about that naming I've might                                 think so I'm worried about managing                                 towards this release and making sure we                                 work on the most important things and                                 then performance these are kind of two                                 things that I'm worried about I don't                                 know catch or ng if you have other                                 things um to your point about is this on                                 yep yes sorry I mean to your point about                                 the fact that we're in a happy zone                                 we're soon to be not a happy zone one of                                 the things I'm kind of worried about is                                 that we don't yet have any kind of                                 infrastructure in place for supporting                                 conflict resolutions and things like                                 that and i think the number of conflicts                                 in the cork you even in the happy zone                                 have been rising just as passions have                                 been in flared and and some people have                                 em how do we put this tactfully a a                                 creative expression of their anyway some                                 people                                 some people just kind of like can get                                 fixated on something and it's just like                                 we don't we don't have a process for for                                 for solving that other than like ping                                 web chick or paying Randy fee or                                 whatever I'm a little worried about that                                 and so I think the work that we've done                                 and the governance you know stuff is                                 really important to try and get that                                 community working group in place before                                 the unhappy season that we have some                                 sort of a structure to handle this as we                                 as we go on so I'm always worried about                                 performance but yeah the game away and I                                 think the other thing is the we've got                                 like a lot of we're trying to put as                                 much infrastructure as we can so that we                                 can use it but we're not really using a                                 lot of things yet very much so we could                                 end up in a situation where we have like                                 the new stuff and an old stuff is still                                 there which we always do every release                                 under same with the entity                                             just about you said no Andrew boy but I                                 would really love it if we didn't do it                                 so much ginger break that we actually                                 got like we like to reuse plug-in system                                  like pot as many plugins as you                                 can and we have like popular request                                 response handing for as many page                                 callbacks and books as we                                 possibly can so that we don't have this                                 like half-assed like four things that                                 like one of them was added in                                         was added into                                                                                                                               still haven't ripped out the old one                                 because we never actually got to the                                 patch it did it so any any stuff looks                                 like finishing that good which which                                 gets back to which goes back to a                                 question of what we're going to do in                                 between november and februari and                                 artists and that and that and that                                 question that we discuss often and among                                 initiative leads and all kinds of people                                 who work on all kinds of stuff is that                                 is that it would be good to have some                                 more clarity on what's the kind of                                 non-feature thing for conversions things                                 to conversion of things to the                                 infrastructure that were built in and                                 if you can provide examples of what you                                 think that would be feasible there so                                 that would help us focus on really the                                 features or the infrastructure to build                                 in and then we can do the conversions                                 and the rest later so am I get into                                 trouble but for me like what what I want                                 to do ages ago was basically if we kept                                 under thresholds just allow if we kept                                 under thresholds we would gradually                                 lower the threshold soon code like their                                 fees fees and if we stayed under any old                                 crap can get in why we're under because                                 it means within well we can still                                 release and you can put API changes you                                 a change stuff on that like we might not                                 do that but what I think if we're                                 comfortable look we can release then we                                 should try to convert stuff because even                                 if someone's motor boat gets messed up                                 in march next year like everyone's mod                                 report in September will be considerably                                 easier so from my point of view by it we                                 need to get time and tighten tighter but                                 we should right we're trying to get api                                 editions into                                                        look i'll give me a look because i think                                 your question was slightly different you                                 wanted to know my my well maybe it's not                                 different but it it's like takes emi                                 because i know cmi a little bit better                                 cmi has a bunch of things that have to                                 happen for example you I to convert or                                 to do synchronization import/export                                 because the thing I toten the video                                 isn't actually in core it's it's a patch                                 that we rejected because it was so                                 unintuitive that it would yeah it                                 totally it's ready to go now and then                                 another thing that needs to happen for                                 cmi to succeed as we need to do                                 conversions of all of the settings pages                                 to cmi and i think the question was more                                 like can we punt some of that kind of                                 stuff until after feature freeze right                                 is that what you ask sir yeah there's a                                 lot of intricacies there so those                                 conversions turnout issues for a moto                                 lingo that might turn into features that                                 we figure out really missing so I'm not                                 saying that should be postponed I'm                                 saying that that if if it needs to be                                 postponed then                                 what what to what extent it's totally                                 okay because we are just it's not                                 features so but I don't think we know                                 yet right I think it's all going to                                 depend on how things are at when we                                 freeze and you know if we're in really                                 good shape I don't I personally don't                                 think it's it's meaningful to release                                 Drupal                                                                  my personal opinion we can discuss that                                 as a community obviously and maybe we                                 should but so if you ask me right now I                                 would say if we're in really good shape                                 um you know we can keep adding features                                 effectively and I think that's along the                                 lines of what you know catch is hoping                                 for I think as well with a system and                                 things like changing like a variable get                                 to like a config getting stuff but it's                                 like borderline API changes and we                                 should just we should we have to get                                 done so if like we just have to call                                 them like major tasks I think an                                 important thing about so one thing maybe                                 quickly introduce yourself and then ask                                 you a question so people know okay I'm                                 just I'm xjm oh thank you and I think                                 that a thing that is different about the                                 cmi conversions is that if those don't                                 happen cmi as a concept doesn't work                                 whereas a lot of these other sort of                                 like API clean up refactor things that                                 we want to do on like the configurable                                 stuff if if core doesn't use its own API                                 for that like if if node types don't get                                 converted that's kind of crappy for DX                                 but at the same time we can still ship                                 with it so I that seems to me like                                 something that's much safer to do much                                 later in the release cycle and I mean to                                 agree with that I because it and things                                 that are being introduced for the                                 initiatives that I'd like that are like                                 new as part of their API think is                                 probably different from stuff that's                                 already a part of core that we're                                 changing so that was my and I agree and                                 you know actually suggested that to come                                 back to the annotations example for                                 example actually suggested that you know                                 annotations could have been it's a good                                 an example of something which could have                                 been done later because                                 I mean a but anyway you disagree well                                 for all annotations in particular I                                 would say that it made views conversion                                 go a lot faster probably but no so the                                 thing is there's always an argument to                                 do something but yeah it will make views                                 conversion faster it yeah it did alright                                 any questions from the audience because                                 I could keep talking but I really want                                 to make is a conversation Doug got green                                 I already asked Meyers this question                                 carries on your take of it I'm a little                                 concerned that we don't I don't know who                                 the major corporate customer is going to                                 be as a beta user you know we had so                                 many bugs we found through examiner and                                 Acquia you know gardens baking this in                                 early and I don't know if we have anyone                                 like that doing that with eight well                                 that's a good question I don't know                                 either anyone planning to use Drupal                                   early on                                 it's so solid chicks thinks he can be                                 done ahead yeah I think it's you know                                 well it were a little bit too close I                                 think but not too close we're a little                                 bit too far away from Drupal                                         ready enough I mean it's still a year                                 from now but hopefully some companies                                 will emerge six so because everybody is                                 harping on this if you look at the state                                 of core we have a couple hundred tests                                 with about                                                             consistently pass what I was referring                                 to Trish yesterday was that last fall                                 when we have introduced the thresholds                                 and begin to refactor drove very                                 seriously we made an agreement that we                                 can comment out tasks to get some reef                                 actors in and open criticals for them to                                 fix this was the process that we agreed                                 that we never needed to do that actually                                 so this is why I said that we are in a                                 surprisingly good very surprisingly                                 solid state and this is why I believe                                 that we are at a much better place than                                 we were when we were doing Drupal                                       example it took about a year to get the                                 upgrade paths fixed now we have upgrade                                 over the pass a test and we have a solid                                 upgrade pass so all those things that                                 were hindering the seven-year cycle is                                 not it's clearly not happening now it                                 doesn't mean that we did not find new                                 things but I think I still think that we                                 are in a very good shape and that's                                 because of the tests that solid that                                 always pass now for a question do we                                 have any ideas of what we are going to                                 do to stop patches getting committees                                 from a nice review state what do you                                 mean by that question sorry well what                                 we're going to do to stop patches being                                 committed from a needs review state                                 instead of the route DBZ state um but                                 that doesn't happen often does it                                 I mean I don't remember I do have                                 examples I don't know well I think at                                 the end of a date seems like it's I mean                                 I should give your example but I think                                 it happens once out of a hundred patches                                 not not even I think so quite probably                                 but this was a particularly big one very                                 recently because the bubbler patch went                                 there why I will actually when you come                                 he did it I was actually reviewing it to                                 cancer there was not our TBC know in                                 case you didn't see so that I really                                 would like that not to happen it                                 whenever it happens it's really annoying                                 it's very it it's hard enough to keep up                                 with the RT bcq but to keep up with the                                 CNR Q in case it gets committed that's                                 impossible all right so it's look at                                 these on a case-by-case basis I mean I                                 don't remember the details of the bundle                                 patch right now but I believe it had                                 been our TBC have been worked on and I                                 looked at it and you looked at it                                 together even with Angie and an Alex and                                 others and we felt it was good to go so                                 you know we can always go back and fix                                 things after it landed yeah and just to                                 point out that um core committer is                                 generally or coroner's because they were                                 really kick-ass patch reviewers before                                 so like I don't I don't necessarily                                 think that that's us should be a rule                                 that we can't commit something from                                 needs review but yeah if you see                                 something that's effed up mark it back                                 to needs work you know we always                                 reiterate on stuff that we in it and if                                 there has been instances where patches                                 were committed that broke things                                 terribly whether they were art did you                                 see or not and then we roll them back                                 it's usually not a not a big deal                                 basically what I guess the the concern                                 that I have is that we are doing only                                 have three months left and we're doing                                 some major changes                                 and especially when we're looking at                                 what's happening with the templating                                 engine and stuff like that if we are in                                 a good state where we only have you know                                 that small amount of bugs etc you know                                 these there a possibility or should we                                 be looking at possibly extending that                                 analysis time to kind of you know really                                 work out what's happening like in                                 regards to how the templating is going                                 to work into the scotch and how Scott                                 just going to fit in with the back just                                 seems like there's a lot of work there                                 and you know possibly need a little bit                                 more analysis with that all sir so it's                                 a good question so the question is                                 really are we going to extend the code                                 trees I mean how are we that that you                                 know because it's such a big change you                                 know it really really is mum how                                 confident are we that come three months                                 time that we're going to have and as I'm                                 kind of more even just talking about the                                 front end stuff let alone you know a lot                                 of what's going on there and just                                 because of the all the interaction with                                 everything you know how confident are we                                 that we're going to be able to be in a                                 state where we're going to have ironed                                 out a lot of that so we don't end up                                 with a Drupal                                                           we want happening but because we didn't                                 get everything in there we still having                                 to have a lot of exceptions in there for                                 things it's a tough one because um I                                 mean we set a date you know the date has                                 been set for a while right and I think                                 it's our job to try and work towards you                                 know that date and whatever date we set                                 you know if we extend it there's going                                 to be other things which are at the face                                 where you know the team system is right                                 now and it's always going to be this                                 discussion always just going to mean                                 these things get in but then these other                                 things which we then started you know                                 and so I don't think I don't think that                                 actually solves any problems it just you                                 know a lot of certain things to get in                                 but then it's still frustrating for                                 other people in the end so like right                                 now I'm not planning to extend the code                                 freeze eight                                 Karen yeah I'm Karen Stevenson Karen                                 statements and Karen s you talk about                                 having like a big example site to sort                                 of test things on and the other thing                                 that really gives an opportunity to test                                 things as control modules right so when                                 contribs starts converting a lot of                                 times that's the thing that sort of                                 flushes on the fact that something's not                                 working so my thinking is you know and I                                 don't know the best I mean it's one                                 thing to just go tell everybody can oh                                 hey contributed to d                                             changing constantly which is really hard                                 to do but just kind of any kind of thing                                 to me and there's some big changes here                                 and and I know as a contributor like                                 until I came here I felt like I was                                 completely losing track of where some of                                 these things were going in it you know                                 so you got to do this whole education                                 process and get your head around what's                                 going on and then and then do the work                                 of doing the upgrade so anything that we                                 can do to support contribs in getting                                 upgraded to d                                                            good testing of how this actually is                                 working out in reality and this is                                 actually a good time to bring it up as                                 we're getting closer to code freeze it                                 also means you know effectively once                                 sorry feature free sigh keep mixing them                                 up but you know once we're a feature                                 frozen but let me actually be a good                                 time to start you know making sure                                 things like go your module work again                                 and like all of our documentation is in                                 good shape to help people with those                                 integration so if you that effectively                                 means you know that the maintainer of                                 code or module this sort of needs to you                                 know start working on getting their                                 module ready for Drupal you know for                                 Drupal                                                                  a good time to start you know to Karen's                                 point to start you know building up the                                 machine to help you know well to help                                 first of all                                                      converted from Drupal                                                   then even bigger is to you know we need                                 to now educate tens of thousands of                                 developers around the world on all of                                 these changes and we need to                                 you know make them symphony developers                                 and so how are we going to do this and                                 it's a giant massive project and I think                                 it's another good reason why it makes                                 sense to have a long go trees frankly                                 because it's going to take people you                                 know quite some time to learn all about                                 all of the changes and to feel to get to                                 a point or have enough confidence in                                 their Symphony skills and like I don't                                 know it just it's a going to be a big                                 process in my mind I don't know if you                                 want to add something ng or or catching                                 in terms of well we need to do there you                                 don't have to if you don't have anything                                 well one thing that would help support                                 that a little bit is on we thanks to the                                 work of Jennifer hodgdon and a couple of                                 other people we moved to this you know                                 in the past when we tracked our API                                 changes it was an enormous wiki page of                                 doom that crass chrome when you looked                                 at it because there's so much crap on it                                 so now it's a little better it's like                                 little nodes but the nodes also keep                                 track of things like does this have a                                 code or upgrade rule attached to it yet                                 and does this have the documentation                                 updated and where does the documentation                                 that affects this live is it themer                                 documentation is it site builder                                 documentation and stuff like that so I                                 think there's a lot of people may be in                                 this audience as well as may be                                 listening after who you know you don't                                 feel like you're one of the hardcore                                 people that are in the cork you                                 twenty-four/seven and notice things like                                 patches getting committed from these                                 review but you do care about Drupal                                   and you really want to help in some way                                 these sort of infrastructure related                                 tasks would be really great move so you                                 know if you are able to port code or                                 upgrade to Drupal                                                    little rules for each of the things in                                 that list and start checking them off                                 that's going to completely accelerate                                 the velocity of getting people to use                                 Drupal                                                                 think I can speak for the coder module                                 maintain errs and they say they don't                                 want that responsibility are they here                                 by to ourselves I see Doug and I know                                 cell is somewhere sorry that                                 right so now dog is them maintainer Oh                                 perfect so if you're interested in                                 helping with that Doug is going to be                                 leading a sprint tomorrow so you can                                 help help help kind of get that                                 infrastructure in place because it's                                 extremely valuable if you want your work                                 to have a big impact it's hard to have a                                 bigger impact than helping hundreds of                                 thousands of developers contributed                                 modules and custom modules and                                 everything make the jump from                                          easily next question one of you things                                 you brought up was worried about                                 performance on like how perform at drupa                                 lates going to be I'm curious if right                                 now we have tests that relate to like                                 except from for whatever that's called                                 for automated testing of performance and                                 also for that on the front end side of                                 it doing stuff like webpagetest                                 automated testing and javascript testing                                 unit because right now as far as I know                                 there's not anything right yeah yeah so                                 there is no real performance testing                                 right now in an automated fashion and                                 it's something that we've dreamt up for                                 many years to be honest like we've                                 always talked about how great it would                                 be to have continuous performance                                 testing the other thing with that is not                                 something you can do with Drupal                                        Drupal                                                               install profiles mm-hmm you could create                                 some tests around install profiles and                                 automate that and they would bring in                                 contribute as well for performance                                 testing news there aren't any ballet is                                 a sandbox I've gotten where it's gone                                 but either boo jeebus or marks all                                 around is the maintainer and there is                                 stuff in there like there's a thing that                                 will let you one like herb basically a                                 simple test test and then get the XH                                 prof output from that so if anyone wants                                 to work on that that would be really                                 amazing because we've known it for years                                 mutineers we don't have it the chances                                 of getting it on the test spot like                                 usefully for Drupal                                                having things that people could run                                 locally would be good and having it sort                                 of you have it like early in                                           be good now like if we want it for                                 Drupal nine someone needs to start                                 working right now and get it running and                                 like because that's that's it could take                                 a year to really really get going but                                 like if if you care about this like                                 manually profiling cool like I had a                                 quick look the other week and we were                                 running like                                                             page because I like a one liner in cash                                 back end like stuff like that still goes                                 in so you just get gigs put any page                                 about finding something open issues for                                 it hey you know and if you don't know                                 how to use it but you do there's a good                                 way to learn and I think it's actually a                                 great way for people to get involved in                                 Drupal I mean it's can probably be a                                 little bit challenging but just                                 profiling and you know performance                                 testing Drupal core and you know finding                                 things and then digging into code and                                 like trying to figure out what why it is                                 slow it's a great way to learn about                                 Drupal and it actually builds up a great                                 skill a skill that's much wanted you                                 know there's a lot of organizations that                                 need these kinds of people that can help                                 them make their Drupal sites faster so                                 it's a great way to learn about Drupal                                 it's a great way to build up some unique                                 skill sets that many many people don't                                 have so next question yeah I'm Thomas                                 Ransome                                 and if we look today Drupal now is a                                 multi-year release between majors and                                 it's not really until you start trying                                 to build sites and there is a healthy                                 amount of contributes where you start to                                 discover that a lot of functionality ink                                 or is actually incomplete to take the                                 country token module                                                     of available tokens and those kind of                                 animals missing tokens in core and                                 wouldn't it be good if those things can                                 be added easier in point releases and                                 not have to live in course you already                                 contribute yes I think it would be armed                                 so that the thing we're always balancing                                 is became more relaxed over time but we                                 have a policy of you know once we have a                                 major release of not breaking api's and                                 you know making sure that websites can                                 easily upgrade and so early on we didn't                                 allow for any new things to be added                                 right now we do have a policy that we                                 can add new features and functionality                                 as long as it doesn't break existing                                 websites and we're a little strict about                                 that though because you know because we                                 don't want to like you know we don't                                 want to break any websites basically                                 when people upgrade you know going                                 forward I think one conversation that I                                 would like to have and it's not just                                 today but like it's going to be quite                                 the conversation is do we want to change                                 our position on backwards compatibility                                 like you know I'm slowly warming up to a                                 model which basically maybe maintains                                 backward compatibility for one release                                 and so that gives us potentially the                                 best of both worlds where we can make                                 API changes we don't need to maintain                                 them forever we need to maintain them                                 for one release right and so Drupal                                   module will run straight on Drupal                                       example however                                 so we would basically the problem though                                 is it would be more work for the core                                 developers so we need to talk about                                 these trade-offs another advantage is if                                 we did maintain backwards compatibility                                 for a release we may be able to do more                                 releases and that could actually get                                 more core developers into Drupal and we                                 could do maybe a yearly release or                                 whatever you know rhythm we choose as a                                 as a community and that would to loop it                                 back to your question that would enable                                 us to you know to make you know maybe                                 bigger changes                                 right but i think it's it's a bit it's a                                 great topic it's been an ongoing                                 conversation I think it will continue to                                 be a conversation I don't think we need                                 to resolve it now but i don't think i                                 would change our position right now but                                 maybe as we wrap up drupal                                            six months of what do we do that would                                 be a great conversation to have and then                                 we know once we start duple nine you                                 know we can implement the change like                                 this if we choose as a community to                                 pursue that so I chime in here one quick                                 SEC sorry chicks but um just to point                                 out we have actually added a number of                                 features to Drupal                                                    filled out a number of missing holes and                                 Drupal                                                               move the entirety of entity API module                                 into core or anything like that but um                                 you know a lot of places where contribs                                 running up against you know shoot                                 we don't even have a hook to inject                                 right here so I can alter a I don't know                                 a widget info or something like that and                                 so we're like okay well let's make sure                                 that there's a hook there you know and                                 so will we actually do as contributed                                 module offers hit problems as long as                                 the issue gets to RTP see and and it's                                 and it doesn't break anything and we you                                 know David Rothstein is amazing at                                 telling he can Percy the future of any                                 kind of things are gonna have a stuff                                 but he's really good at like analyzing                                 that stuff and there's actually a number                                 of things that we've we've committed to                                 Drupal                                                                 that because we have all the automated                                 tests so I think as we go forward and in                                 project we can get more and more loose                                 as we get more experience with it but I                                 think right now I think we have the                                 right balance between like we could add                                 that but that might break other people's                                 sites so we're not going to do that that                                 has living trip but this thing totally                                 makes sense and the risk is very low as                                 with that in but it is pretty much case                                 per case basis at the moment tricks                                 again yeah so about the drop our goal                                 aight country boss was needing to learn                                 symphony that i just want to reassure                                 everybody you probably won't need to do                                 it because most of the symphony things                                 are not going to be visible an emotional                                 level v most likely won't get there it                                 was it second thing that I begin to                                 think about this and one thing that                                 people actually warmer                                 the company's people work for good help                                 well is to have free trainings for                                 contrib ulcers because the training that                                 the country browser needs is very                                 different from what the site builder                                 needs and obviously most of them don't                                 have the money for training and they                                 need training because if you look at                                 most country modules so that was an idea                                 people couldn't see his face but so the                                 s                                                                        is a probably aware I just wanted to say                                 before you Apple albert is that eight is                                 not a good play but nine is probably is                                 because we are getting it to the point                                 where the code is not the spaghetti it                                 was so that better like I deserve two                                 good points we couldn't do it it just                                 wanted to say that we couldn't do it                                 before because the whole code was so                                 interconnected that you change one API                                 and everything breaks so it was really                                 impossible to do bc is so far all right                                 thank you good point Ryan I had a                                 question about views in core basically                                 okay um I actually like this in court                                 but it's one of the things that gives                                 users a surprising amount of ability to                                 shoot themselves in the foot and it's                                 been kind of nicest and contribute on                                 low Drupal core anything you can click                                 together in Drupal core should perform                                 and the best drupal's job to make that                                 happen clearly that's not true for views                                 you can make things that perform very                                 poorly has been any thought to adding                                 hooks to allow either country                                 to allow either can trigger core to give                                 users guide lines on either how to write                                 views or a very large set of examples on                                 common views for sites I think I think                                 chicks wrote a module that tells you if                                 you have bad joins in your views uh-huh                                 so um I don't know it does that work                                 chicks know it never detected any better                                 for much it existed hahaha if the module                                 exists in my Blair do you mean like an                                 actual light in core you make a really                                 bad view and it says you look all you've                                 done perhaps or at least examples                                 because you can never like a user will                                 always be able to find a new way to do                                 something poorly but examples for like                                 common idioms and I know that the work                                 for getting views in isn't but at least                                 getting the discussion started about it                                 I hadn't heard it I mean it it would be                                 cool to have like an issue to discuss                                 whether that would be like a feature we                                 could add like I would think probably                                 biomes want to talk about how to do it                                 it's like beginning make of unity get                                 big red warning and it says your view is                                 going to destroy your site and the guys                                 look like three nodes and four users but                                 yeah I mean but something all these all                                 these making sure it's still easy for                                 chick this module to work or yeah but                                 i'm but also let me find me know are                                 things in caller perform really badly                                 that you can weaken you can you neighbor                                 statistics module one module and stuff                                 like that well forms actually not as bad                                 as it used to be no sorry add a thousand                                 feels yet so many nothing compares to                                 something that you would expect to be                                 able to do                                 no no thanks a technical issue it's a I                                 think in general it's a great principle                                 that would like we should try and                                 protect users from you know destroying                                 their sites so I think I'll you know                                 we'll take it as a call to action and                                 hopefully we can have a discussion                                 around it mark yes just a comment about                                 the automated performance testing idea                                 so you like I said we looked at that                                 little while back and doing some of the                                 profiling on Drupal                                                     patches I found it's a little more                                 complex than what we would get from that                                 because it's not as if we have patches                                 going in and we can say that we had this                                 performance aggression and it's because                                 of this patch it's we have incremental                                 changes going in like so say the colonel                                 to we bootstrapped much farther to even                                 instantiate the colonel to get                                 functionality that we had earlier in the                                 bootstrap before so right now we have a                                 much much larger code path when that                                 went in but it's not to say when you                                 look at that issue it's like well we                                 have a ten percent regression we need to                                 or we can't put it in its we just maybe                                 to make sure to follow up and take out                                 all the old code we don't need anymore                                 because like working on the HTTP cache                                 there I found there's a lot of code                                 there that's really redundant with                                 what's in the colonel not yet so I have                                 a opening issue this week which is like                                 a critical task to fix sort of                                 performance and questions while many                                 other so what I want to try and do is                                 this the issues that we know like                                 request performance and then list the                                 issues that are going to fix them in                                 some way whether they were late it or                                 not necessarily so that we can check                                 that because we because we are we are                                 like I'm lonely committing patches that                                 have performance for questions and                                 sometimes unknowingly but it's exactly                                 to that we put stuff in and then we                                 might not even use it and we don't have                                 a performance question and said it's                                  used by every core module like six                                  months later so but I really don't want                                  to wait to come out and be southern g                                    which was sold into /                                                ninja proof live like there would be                                  nice to actually get or any I think if                                  we go if we go all the way through what                                  we've done                                  then there's so many wonderful things                                  that we will be able to do to make                                  people slides blazing fast like both fun                                  and performance and service like just                                  service I'd performs and scalability                                  everything could be lovely if we get                                  there so but like as we're getting                                  closer to code freeze I'm quite happy to                                  bump the issues that have to finish this                                  to not have regressions two critical                                  tasks because if not we have like nasty                                  nasty performance go patients in eight                                  months so but so please help I'll fight                                  for the issue up somewhere and if people                                  can help by identified what what what we                                  do then we can like figure out where we                                  really need to focus on line performance                                  over the next six months and maybe we                                  can make it part of our default you know                                  workflow like we have these meta issues                                  like you know one issue one thing broken                                  down into                                                               be and step                                                               got in like you know step                                              performance testing and maybe we can                                  start by tracking it better I don't know                                  all right fix come back checking taxes I                                  mean six module but it's about                                           of code it's trivial                                                   her name avoid avoid great okay I'm                                  seeing two more people that they are                                  doing joins that they shouldn't really                                  do all right thank you                                  my name is Sebastiano co um I have a                                  question regarding how well you think                                  you're doing engaging people to come                                  into core the thing is I know drupal a                                  year now maybe more and i think the the                                  curve to learn the through the website                                  is a bit too steep and i think it                                  shouldn't be it's not actually that                                  difficult but maybe I haven't found the                                  waist through the website or through the                                  initiatives that are really like but you                                  say in German for cone like preparing                                  you to to be able to engage into into                                  work that is really needed and                                  everybody's asking for so I think we can                                  always do better at this however I do                                  feel like we as a community are pretty                                  remarkable in terms of trying to get                                  people in through a lot of different                                  things we do from tagging issues to                                  organizing sprints and you know Jessie's                                  a prime example of somebody who is very                                  passionate about getting more people                                  into the door you wanna say a few things                                  of it okay so I'd like to point out                                  specific things that we are actually                                  doing to try to engage new core                                  contributors one thing is there is we do                                  office hours twice a week in the drupal                                  IRC channel the premise is that anyone                                  who has some drupal site that the                                  experience can come and get a                                  self-contained task to work on an issue                                  in core so all they have to do they                                  don't have to have any special skills                                  and it won't be any special particular                                  issue it might be something that's as                                  trivial as you know like clean up the                                  comments and a patch but that gives them                                  a chance to interact directly with core                                  developers another thing that we're do                                  what you actually doing this is a great                                  lead-in and thank you i wanted to                                  mention some anyway we're doing a sprint                                  on friday um that is if you haven't                                  contributed to core before and you're                                  interested we have a free training that                                  Addison Barry and the Drupal eyes me                                  team are doing to train people sort of                                  bootstrap them and this is what these                                  are the tools that you need to                                  contribute to core here's how you                                  navigate the core issue queue here's the                                  kinds of things you can work on                                  and we're going to be doing more of                                  those trainings we've done six so far                                  this will be the seventh and they'll be                                  there's one today we'll do another one a                                  bad camp and so on there's another thing                                  i'd really like to highlight is on the                                  drupal ladder initiative drupal.org is                                  the URL this is a program where um it's                                  designed for local user groups to make                                  part of their their weekly meetups be                                  learning how to contribute to core and                                  then taking a particular issue in core                                  and working on it as a user group so                                  that's like there's like three different                                  paths that we can take and um I guess                                  sort of making people aware of them is                                  is a big deal because I mean all these                                  things all these things have been here                                  for people like a year now all these few                                  things have existed so if anyone has any                                  suggestions on how to promote that                                  better and how to make people more aware                                  that's great but I guess the biggest                                  thing is word of mouth you know tell go                                  to your local user cup and say hey come                                  to office hours hey do you want to try                                  this Drupal ladder thing and I'm sure                                  that the people who are working on that                                  would love to help yourself Thank medias                                  so how amazing is that

and Jessie beach                                  and I work with women leaders in for the                                  past three months we have been working                                  our asses off on the spark distribution                                  which is for Drupal                                                      the goal has always been for spark to be                                  you know recommending authoring                                  experience improvements to Drupal                                         and we're using Drupal                                                 for that in order to allow people to                                  actually try the stuff on real sites and                                  and stuff like that I would love like                                  we've done a lot of sessions we've done                                  a lot of buffs we've had some great                                  discussions here I would love to get a                                  sense from the room as to whether or not                                  we have agreement that this stuff would                                  be awesome in core and we can go                                  balls out trying to get it into Drupal                                    or if we should stick to contribute any                                  buddy have any comments on that so all                                  right quick oh yes yeah we need to do a                                  pole art um I I haven't seen many of the                                  workshops but I've looked at some of the                                  videos online and I've downloaded the                                  demo thing and how to play and I think                                  it is incredibly awesome I just want to                                  say that and I would be incredibly                                  excited to see that n                                                 concerned if it's too much work and we                                  don't get him in there do we have                                  anything and so I was talking to nate                                  quick sketch it is here about the sort                                  of like the low end version of                                  improvements you know is that you know                                  if we if we can't make we can't have all                                  of the wonder of spark what's plan B I                                  think the all the wonder of spark                                  requires a lot of the architecture stuff                                  that has to have                                  for other initiatives anyway so be a way                                  of funneling in resources to Drupal                                    that don't exist right now because                                  they're on Drupal                                                      smart people that are awesome so I think                                  that the plan B would just be you know                                  if we if we work our butts off and we                                  try and get all of these things like                                  blocks and layouts in place and filter                                  system improvements in place in this                                  other stuff and let me get to the end                                  and we we don't quite have the the                                  WYSIWYG patch ready yet or this that                                  knee other thing they would they would                                  continue living contributor polite but i                                  think i don't know i would really like                                  to work on it um do people agree yay                                  okay does anybody want to hit me with a                                  tomato okay tomato bomb yeah did you                                  want to my kid all right thank

talked about the                                  problem of core developers                                  sustainability core contributors                                  sustainability in general which is                                  something that I think concerns a lot of                                  people and so I'd like to repeat                                  something

                               lead for whichever initiative ever you                                  want you hear over and over again these                                  converse shoes every
