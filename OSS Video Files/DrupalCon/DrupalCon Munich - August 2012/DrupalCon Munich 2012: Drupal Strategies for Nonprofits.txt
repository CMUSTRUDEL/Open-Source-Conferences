specifically I'm going to                                go over some examples of Drupal sites                                that we've done for non-profit clients                                and then Scott's going to talk about                                distributions contributions and                                collaboration with the community but                                first I'd like to get an idea of who's                                here so how many of you in the room work                                in designer development shops or are                                freelancers okay okay great and how many                                of you work for nonprofit organizations                                or agencies fantastic that's wonderful                                great well I am NOT a designer or a                                developer although I work with quite a                                few very good ones but I do have some                                nonprofit experience I was actually                                raised in west africa i spent about                                   years there as a child with my brothers                                who also work for Aten and during that                                time                                living in the people group that we lived                                in we saw some of the severe issues                                facing people and I know that that goes                                beyond the group that i was living in                                too many parts of the world issues that                                are threatening lives and livelihoods                                political unrest lack of education lack                                of clean water lack of health care so at                                this point in my life I'm just very                                grateful to be a part of a team that's                                helping to do this kind of good work for                                larger organizations who are doing large                                international good work as well it's an                                interesting niche to be in today but I'm                                just really appreciative of that                                opportunity so um I'd like to talk about                                Drupal a little bit Drupal is Thanks                                yeah that would be great can you get a                                bit of things fast becoming a leading                                solution for some of these issues that                                are facing nonprofits and we don't have                                a lot of time to get into the detail but                                I want to cover a few of those points                                first we're seeing that financial                                partners donors and funders for                                nonprofits want to give their money to                                groups that are doing the most good and                                creating the longer lasting impacts and                                also to groups that are able to maintain                                a very high level of accountability                                about the work that they're doing so                                donors want to know what's happening                                with their money and they want the most                                out of it this requires a level of                                accountability from nonprofits that                                depends on quick communication and the                                ability to quickly share information                                this was not possible in years past                                certainly much of the world it can in                                much of the world it can take and has                                taken weeks to get reports from one                                country to another as an example when I                                was a child my parents kept in touch                                with their colleagues on a radio every                                morning and as a teenager the closest                                internet connection was eight hours away                                 over dirt roads and then once you                                 arrived there you could only get                                 internet access if the phone lines were                                 up and the power was on and they often                                 or not so we've come a long way in the                                 past decade and a half part another                                 issue with this idea of accountability                                 is an expectation by funders and a goal                                 by nonprofits themselves to see                                 the money going to the actual work that                                 they're doing so for example if i'm                                 working with a non-profit for children                                 in africa i don't want that money                                 scooped up into admin overhead in paris                                 or DC I want to know that those children                                 are actually being provided for out of                                 the funds that were managing so again                                 the web has been changing it continues                                 to change and it's being used less today                                 as a billboard style marketplace and                                 more of a robust tool for communication                                 collaboration information sharing                                 there's an ability to literally invite                                 the entire world to be a part of your                                 work it's pretty awesome and then to                                 provide those partners with the tools                                 they need to confidently continue their                                 involvement organisations can now keep                                 the public and their donors up to date                                 on their progress and on their needs                                 this raises awareness which is great it                                 also creates more funding which is great                                 and ultimately it advances the good work                                 that's being done so this is where                                 drupal comes in Drupal provides the                                 tools needed by the nonprofit and the                                 tools that partners financial partners                                 are looking for and because of the large                                 community collaboration in the Drupal                                 community it's very similar to that of                                 the nonprofit community we see that time                                 and costs can be saved so Scott's going                                 to talk a little bit later about                                 functionality and customization                                 available in Drupal and in the                                 distributions and how that can cut                                 overhead for web development while still                                 answering specific and varied needs for                                 different clients so like I said earlier                                 we've worked with many nonprofits over                                 the years and each of them have had very                                 different missions goals for their work                                 but we've noticed some similarities in                                 their web development needs it was these                                 similarities and a lot of contribution                                 that led to our release of the open aid                                 distribution and open aid is our                                 response to some of the issues facing                                 nonprofits and sort of how to respond to                                 those so I'd like to share some examples                                 of the client work that's helped to                                 clarify these needs and then eventually                                 to shape the open aid distribution                                 International Center for journalists I                                 cfj strives to be a catalyst for change                                 through good journalism they believe                                 that independent media is crucial to                                 improving the human condition the work                                 is pretty awesome they are partnering                                 with the Poynter Institute which is                                 another journalism program organization                                 to provide training and support for                                 journalists around the world and                                 specifically in countries where it is                                 extremely difficult to tell the truth                                 about things and often life-threatening                                 to do so I cfj seeks to strengthen                                 societies through accountable                                 relationships with their partners like                                 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation                                 and the knight Foundation in addition to                                 this providing of tools and resources                                 they are also trying to educate the                                 public on what they're doing so during                                 our discovery process with ICF J we                                 found they had some specific                                 requirements for their web presence and                                 we'll just go through some of these                                 slides that might be a bit a bit quick                                 the screenshots an image carousel I cfj                                 uses an image carousel to quickly                                 communicate the work that they're doing                                 and the stories that they're covering                                 the new section is presented in a blog                                 style it includes search capabilities                                 multi author blogs I cfj has a variety                                 of blog contributors worldwide so this                                 gives them the opportunity to present                                 author information on the right and then                                 the blog's down the middle profile pages                                 provide detailed information about                                 contributors and partners with space for                                 related projects and social media                                 coverage program pages this section                                 allows I cfj to focus on their projects                                 so they can include video images                                 information about the individuals                                 working in those projects and event                                 information mapping on I cfj site is                                 worked into their program pages so                                 basically if you click on a point on the                                 map it takes you directly to the program                                 page associated with that area and                                 partner profiles this is of course                                 extremely important to any nonprofit it                                 gives a place to present                                 partner information and these of course                                 are the groups and people making the                                 work possible and a resource library                                 this provides out I cfj provides a lot                                 of resources on their site and these are                                 searchable by language so the second                                 client I'd like to go over as                                 international center for transitional                                 justice I had no idea who these people                                 were when we started this project and                                 this idea of transitional justice was a                                 new one to me I see TJ works a                                 transitional justice refers to measures                                 taken in the wake of massive human                                 rights violations so this group is                                 coming in after things like genocide war                                 crimes child slavery gender oppression                                 and they're partnering with government                                 and non-government organizations to I                                 don't wanna stay clean up societies but                                 they're working with the criminal                                 perpetrators and also with the victims                                 to make sure that people who are                                 responsible for these atrocities are                                 being held accountable and to work with                                 societies to make sure that there's not                                 repeat atrocities it's if you have a                                 chance to look this side up it's pretty                                 amazing so during our discovery process                                 with I see TJ we define the following                                 requirements for their website an image                                 carousel like I cfj that we saw before                                 they're using an image carousel here to                                 quickly communicate their work to their                                 audience news section these items are                                 presented chronologically there's                                 associated topics listed on the bottom                                 of each item for more reading profile                                 pages again this gives a space for                                 detailed information on ICT Jays                                 leadership their staff and their                                 partners program pages there's a lot of                                 room for images here with room for news                                 and updates on the sidebar and mapping                                 this map works a little different than                                 the first client that we saw these in                                 this site the program pages are actually                                 the country so the maps been customized                                 in Drupal to work in two separate ways                                 for two different clients that needed                                 two different things I see TJ uses a lot                                 of photographs to communicate with their                                 users                                 so there are several image galleries on                                 their site that they can use for that                                 and a resource library these resources                                 resources are listed by publish date                                 they're searchable by type country issue                                 and language and the final client I'd                                 like to go over is knowledge for health                                 k for health is a USAID funded                                 organization they manage and distribute                                 evidence-based information and tools to                                 provide health care health services in                                 developing countries what that actually                                 means is that by providing health                                 information in audience friendly fashion                                 to multiple people groups around the                                 world they're able to help save lives                                 and create sustainable practices health                                 practices in developing countries                                 they're run by the Johns Hopkins                                 Bloomberg School of Public Health Center                                 for communication programs so we worked                                 with them to improve their web products                                 and to redesign their primary web                                 presence and during that process we                                 discovered the following items that they                                 would need for their site an image                                 carousel the spaces again allowing them                                 like the previous examples to quickly                                 visually communicate to their users a                                 new section this is another good example                                 of Drupal customization the new section                                 here like the previous example is                                 presented in a blog style                                 chronologically whereas the first                                 example is searchable by categories and                                 date range profile pages on K for health                                 site include an image bio copy and blog                                 post links and program pages this                                 presents a zoomed in view of the map                                 specific to that area so we see here                                 Ethiopia with the map of Ethiopia the                                 mapping this one on kafir health site                                 operates similarly to that of ICF J so                                 you just click on a point on the map and                                 it takes you directly to the program                                 associated with that area and finally a                                 resource library much of what K for                                 health does is to provide resources                                 around the world so these are searchable                                 by type and topic so through the three                                 cite examples I cfj ICT J&K for health                                 we see that one of them is journalism                                 one of them is transitional justice on                                 one works in healthcare so they all have                                 different goals and missions but they                                 have very similar knee                                 for their web presences each of these                                 clients has specific and complex                                 functionality that we obviously don't                                 have time to get into but I think it's                                 good to just look at this idea of the                                 commonalities and the differences and                                 how we've been able to optimize both for                                 the needs of the client so during our                                 work with K for health we learn that in                                 addition to their own website they're                                 responsible for rolling out websites for                                 affiliate organizations their affiliates                                 and USAID affiliates so we had an                                 opportunity to come on with that project                                 as well and to build a platform that                                 allows their internal developers to roll                                 out these micro sites for their                                 affiliates it was during that process                                 that we started to see the similarities                                 and thought hey outside of USAID and K                                 for health there's probably a number of                                 nonprofits that could benefit from this                                 platform so with a lot of work by our                                 team and their team and many other                                 people we looked through some of the                                 work that we had done and came up with a                                 list of consistent needs for nonprofit                                 sites and this list is going to look                                 pretty familiar this is our list of                                 consistently utilized nonprofit and NGO                                 features an image carousel news                                 multi-author blogs profile pages program                                 pages mapping partner profiles image                                 galleries and a resource library so with                                 a lot of intentional contribution from                                 the K for health team and our team at                                 Aten and many different levels of many                                 different organizations we were able to                                 release this platform as to open a                                 distribution on drupal.org we call open                                 aid a turnkey website platform designed                                 to help small NGOs and international                                 development projects create cost                                 effective program focused websites                                 quickly so Scott's going to talk more in                                 detail about distributions and open aid                                 and also about collaboration and                                 contribution okay before we get too far                                 into open aid and how that works I want                                 to back up a little bit and talk about                                 distributions um is our people familiar                                 with distributions in Drupal                                 yep it's like maybe half of you so                                 distributions are relatively new to                                 Drupal and we've had similar things in                                 the past that we've gone by a few                                 different names that were kind of                                 consolidating on how this works and this                                 is the documentation on drupal.org about                                 what a distribution is so I just want to                                 read through this to give you kind of a                                 technical overview such distributions                                 are full copies of Drupal that include                                 Drupal core along with additional                                 software such as themes modules                                 libraries and installation profiles                                 that's kind of the technical definition                                 of distributions but that doesn't really                                 give you a great idea of why                                 distributions are important how they're                                 going to change the way we work with                                 Drupal so I want to talk about why you                                 should care about this and the first                                 part of that is to talk about how do /                                 works on this is probably familiar to                                 many of you as well there's an                                 often-used metaphor for Drupal that it's                                 like a pile of Legos so when you get a                                 Drupal site you have a bunch of                                 different pieces modules that you can                                 put together modules and themes and                                 other things but mostly modules that you                                 can put together to make whatever you                                 want with Drupal but um when you first                                 install Drupal it doesn't actually do                                 that much an initial drupal install it's                                 kind of a blank slate to build whatever                                 you want so Legos are cool they're great                                 and Drupal is great you can make houses                                 and spaceships and dinosaurs or whatever                                 you want you can make whatever you want                                 with Drupal too but the downside of that                                 is it takes a lot of work to find like                                 the right pieces and put them together                                 in the right ways and we found that that                                 work is especially hard for nonprofits                                 which have limited resources and want to                                 put those resources as much as they can                                 in to their core work so that's kind of                                 a problem that we've had in the past                                 with Drupal that especially affects                                 nonprofits so the alternative to this is                                 kind of the playmobil approach and if                                 you're not familiar playmobil as a                                 product that comes preassembled so if                                 you want to make a dinosaur with Legos                                 you buy the dinosaur set or you buy just                                 generic Legos and put them together but                                 if you want to dinosaur with playmobil                                 you                                 go to the store and buy the preassembled                                 dinosaur and you're done you don't have                                 to put it together and make it work like                                 a dinosaur it already does that and this                                 is probably closer to how something like                                 WordPress works wordpress when you                                 install it it's a pretty full featured                                 blog product you you you can add more to                                 it but you don't generally have to add                                 more to it you can often just install it                                 and start using it on unfortunately the                                 downside to that approach is that it's a                                 little less flexible if you buy a                                 Playmobil dinosaur and you want to make                                 it green or you want to make it bigger                                 you can't really do that with Playmobil                                 and to a lesser extent that's true of                                 WordPress as well you can install                                 WordPress but if you want to make it if                                 you want to make your blog have a map or                                 have a donation system or something                                 that's much harder to do with WordPress                                 because it's not as flexible it's not as                                 modular so this is where distributions                                 come in and hopefully solve all of these                                 problems on distributions I think are                                 like preassembled LEGO sets so you buy                                 them but you don't buy them but I you                                 get them and they already do something                                 for you you don't have to put them                                 together to do what you want to do but                                 they also have the flexibility that you                                 can take them apart and make your                                 dinosaur bigger make your Drupal site do                                 something slightly different but it                                 already does something so you get all of                                 the advantages of both worlds which is                                 especially good like I said before for                                 nonprofits that have limited resources                                 so the idea of a distribution is the                                 technical team can install it and                                 administrators can immediately start                                 using it without having to wait for any                                 sort of custom coding if you're doing                                 custom coding you can start using it                                 while you're doing that you don't have                                 to wait on the technical process before                                 you can actually get some benefit out of                                 it so we've seen some ways that                                 nonprofits specifically are benefiting                                 from distributions and for smaller                                 nonprofits the first way is kind of like                                 what I talked about is the playmobil                                 approach smaller nonprofits                                 distributions are really great because                                 you can just install them and use them                                 you don't have to spend much time at all                                 if any actually using a distribution in                                 Drupal you can like I said customize                                 beyond so if you find a distribution                                 that does almost what you want it to do                                 you can install it turn it on start                                 using it but then like do the the last                                 ten percent or whatever of how you want                                 it to work for larger nonprofits                                 distributions are used like that but                                 they're also used in some other ways on                                 larger nonprofits get a big advantage                                 out of distributions in kind of                                 filtering conversations around what                                 they're doing so if you go through the                                 time to talk about your organization's                                 needs and your goals and pick a                                 distribution that you think meets those                                 needs and goals pretty well then as                                 you're having requests that come in for                                 additional functionality that is desired                                 if you pick something that meets your                                 needs and goals and you're talking about                                 something that isn't accomplished by the                                 distribution that's often a good                                 indicator that maybe you need to back up                                 and talk about what you're trying to do                                 and that is that actually part of our                                 organization's goals that's kind of a                                 non technical advantage of distributions                                 for larger nonprofits larger nonprofits                                 also can use distributions have the                                 opportunity whose distributions as not                                 so much a ready-to-use website but it                                 ready to build kind of development                                 platform and this is actually we're not                                 a non-profit but this is actually what                                 we do at addin with distributions                                 primarily we have a custom distribution                                 that we use internally that has all of                                 the Drupal development tools that we use                                 to build sites pre-installed so that we                                 when we start building a site we don't                                 have to download and enable views for                                 example that's already there and that                                 saves us a lot of time at the beginning                                 of a project so for larger nonprofits                                 that are rolling out a lot of different                                 sites this can save a lot of time                                 building something that kind of does                                 what you're going to do at the beginning                                 of every project and then you don't have                                 to do that over and over again like                                 Lydia said before this is also what we                                 built for the K for health team                                 they're rolling out a lot of sites for                                 their affiliates so we made something                                 that would allow them to roll out those                                 sites a little more quickly we                                 identified the common needs that they                                 had and made something that accomplishes                                 most of what they are using on any of                                 their sites and then they can do that                                 end customization without having to                                 repeat the same steps over and over                                 again and like Lydia said before as we                                 went through this process we recognize                                 that what we were building would be                                 useful beyond k for health and their                                 affiliates it and we put some work into                                 making it not just a development                                 distribution but an actual end-user                                 distribution and that's what we                                 eventually released as the open aid                                 distribution so based on our experience                                 working not only with K for health but                                 with many of the other nonprofit                                 organizations we've worked with we're                                 hopeful that Kate that the open a                                 distribution is a tool that many                                 nonprofit organizations can use to kind                                 of solve their base needs if not all of                                 their needs and fortunately talking with                                 the K for health team about this they                                 agreed that this would be a good idea to                                 release this as a contribution on                                 drupal.org so after we were done with                                 their kind of internal project we put                                 some additional time into generalizing                                 this approach into a platform that would                                 hopefully be more useful to a wider                                 community and that's what we released as                                 the open a distribution so this is the                                 list of features that open eight has                                 which hopefully by now looks really                                 familiar there's an image carousel                                 there's news there's multi-author blogs                                 profile pages program pages there's                                 mapping partner profiles image galleries                                 resource libraries in addition to all of                                 that open eight has some other                                 capabilities beyond that kind of base                                 level set of features including branding                                 accommodation for logos so organizations                                 can put their own logos in there we're                                 not like it comes open it comes with                                 like an open aid logo but we don't                                 expect anyone to actually run an open                                 aid site with the open a logo or                                 assuming they're going to replace that                                 with their own logos on theirs customer                                 will color schemes so everyone can kind                                 of brand the site to go with their own                                 look and feel automated translation                                 using translate this which is especially                                 useful for organizations working                                 internationally so they can have content                                 available to people speaking a variety                                 of languages social media links which                                 almost everyone is using now and a                                 mobile-friendly responsive design so                                 that open eight sites look good not only                                 on desktop and laptop computers but they                                 look great on tablets and mobile devices                                 which is increasingly important so this                                 is kind of what what it looks like to                                 install open a but also what it looks                                 like to install most distributions to                                 kind of give you an idea of why                                 distributions are useful um so this                                 looks a lot like the standard drupal                                 install process normally you have a                                 standard install option and a minimal                                 install option and if you download a                                 distribution you'll have a at least a                                 third option in this case you have the                                 open aid site option after you choose                                 that you go through the same language                                 and database setup that you would with                                 any Drupal site on and then you go to                                 the list of modules that are being                                 enabled by default open aid installs a                                 little bit more than a standard Drupal                                 site like in this initial process but it                                 doesn't actually do a lot more than                                 Drupal the big difference with open                                 eight is what happens after this you get                                 redirected to this page which hopefully                                 you can see this is a list of all of the                                 functionality that it's available and                                 open aid and the idea with open eight is                                 that after you install it you go through                                 this list and decide what do you                                 actually want to do with it so if you                                 want to do blogs you turn on the blog                                 feature if you want to list your                                 partner's you turn on the partners                                 feature and after going through this                                 list and deciding what do you want to do                                 with it and checking the boxes next to                                 the features that you want you just                                 click Save and all of that functionality                                 is immediately available like I said                                 before you have the option to customize                                 anything you want but hopefully it comes                                 pretty close to meeting your needs and                                 you can immediately start entering                                 content and that content will show up on                                 your site where you would expect it to                                 and your site is quick hopefully quickly                                 usable right after install so I want to                                 talk about some sites that have been                                 built on opening so far to give you an                                 idea of kind of how distributions are                                 used in practice the first of those is                                 the global health mini University and                                 this site is an annual forum that brings                                 together professionals working in global                                 health and they do presentations                                 somewhat like drupalcon I guess                                 presentations highlighting                                 evidence-based backtrack best practices                                 and kind of state-of-the-art information                                 in in the health industry so open aid                                 was designed as a web platform for                                 organizations to kind of promote their                                 own work and talk about what they're                                 doing the good work that they're doing                                 in the world but we found with the the                                 mini university site that it works just                                 as well for this kind of event based                                 site that has many of the same needs as                                 an organization so you can see for their                                 using the image carousel feature not to                                 show images of the work they're doing                                 but the show images of the event that                                 they did that they've done previously to                                 kind of attract people to the next event                                 and they're using what we're calling the                                 hero statement feature over on the right                                 there too rather than to talk about                                 their organization it talks about the                                 event and gives dates and information                                 about when the event is happening using                                 latest updates to give updates on the                                 event and they're using the partners                                 feature to list the event sponsors so it                                 we were happy to see that open aid was                                 proving useful kind of in this context                                 that we hadn't previously planned on it                                 being used in the next site I want to                                 talk about is the N health working group                                 site ml tha's a collaborative effort by                                 eleven different organizations to                                 promote the use of mobile technology in                                 the health industry so they work to                                 build capacity encourage collaboration                                 and share knowledge about how mobile                                 technology can work within a larger                                 global health strategy                                 and of course one of the most important                                 features of open a that was useful for                                 them is the responsive design of course                                 they're trying to promote the use of                                 mobile technology so they need a site                                 that works well on mobile devices and                                 opening just does that out of the box so                                 they don't have to do anything to get                                 that advantage the M health working                                 group site also like I said has a lot of                                 different organizations working together                                 they have they're doing a hundred                                 different projects in                                              countries and they're working together                                 with organizations like Catholic Relief                                 Services k for health Save the Children                                 so one of the big issues that they have                                 content wise is how do they promote all                                 of these different organizations and                                 like in a way that gets them all enough                                 attention that it's worth their                                 investment in this effort one way                                 opening does that is with this partners                                 page that is just a page that lists all                                 of the partners with their logos and                                 links to their sites to if someone's                                 specifically interested in who is behind                                 this they can go here and see them                                 another way open a does this is with                                 this partners sidebar interface and this                                 is a scrolling interface of again all of                                 the partners but it takes up a little                                 less space so it allows them to put it                                 throughout the site so if you're just                                 looking at some other content you might                                 notice the one of the partners and that                                 kind of give some increased visibility                                 to the people who are contributing to                                 this work m health also uses open aids                                 resource library and they're using the                                 optional integration with Apache Solr                                 which you can see over on the right                                 there that gives them a listing of the                                 different types of resources that                                 they're sharing in like how many and                                 that allows them to filter down and kind                                 of in a more of a browsable interface                                 with Apache Solr so they're using that                                 to share things like their meeting                                 minutes and presentation slides as well                                 as documents that they've specifically                                 created to share so that that kind of                                 gives them some increased transparency                                 and lets people see how their work is                                 happening not                                 what they're doing that like what how                                 they're doing it finally I wanna talk                                 about the malaria free future site this                                 is one of the first sites that launched                                 on the open a platform and I think it's                                 a good example of how you can kind of                                 customize a distribution like open aid                                 to work more specifically with your                                 organization's needs so malaria free                                 future is an organization seeking to                                 improve control of malaria and they work                                 with public and private organizations in                                 Ghana South Africa Tanzania and Uganda                                 and their goal is to scale up malaria                                 control and kind of solve the malaria                                 problem and the first thing you can see                                 here if you can see that is that they've                                 I significantly changed the navigation                                 of open aid that you get initial II for                                 example project projects what we're                                 talking what we're calling projects for                                 the malaria free future organization                                 those are all country specific so                                 they're referring to those as country                                 programs which is a little more in line                                 with the type of language that they're                                 their visitors would expect they've also                                 added a few items to the navigation that                                 are specific to the the focus of their                                 organization so they have a united                                 against malaria navigation item which of                                 course doesn't come with open aid                                 because that's not something that                                 everyone needs but it's something that                                 they specifically need and they're able                                 to easily add that to the navigation and                                 kind of work it in with the rest of what                                 comes with open eight out of the box                                 like I said before they're working in                                 several parts of Africa specifically so                                 they're using the mapping feature in                                 open aid already zoomed in on the                                 specific areas where they're working                                 which allows rather than having a global                                 map that only has points in a specific                                 area they've zoomed that in on the area                                 that they're working in so people can                                 click on Tanzania and see the work that                                 they're doing in Tanzania so that's kind                                 of like how you can change open aid and                                 some of the ways people are using up an                                 aid                                 we've set up a demo site at open a                                 destroyed org with everything that                                 opening does turned on so if you want to                                 play with that you can see everything                                 that opening does and that also that                                 that's as much as possible a bare                                 minimum install of course we had to add                                 some sample content so you can see it                                 but this is pretty close to what you get                                 like if you just download and install                                 open Abe speaking of which open a distro                                 also has a link to where you download                                 open eight which is just the project                                 page on drupal.org so if you want you                                 can download it and install it yourself                                 and hopefully that is a quick process to                                 see what open eight could do for you                                 we're of course excited about open eight                                 and how people can use open aid and we                                 have some flyers and buttons up here if                                 you're also excited about it but we                                 recognize open aid is not the solution                                 for everyone or even all nonprofits                                 that's not at all our goal what we                                 really want to focus on is open eight as                                 an example of using distributions                                 because we think distributions is a                                 great solution for a lot of                                 organizations including a lot of                                 nonprofits and there are some other                                 great distributions that are                                 specifically interesting to nonprofits                                 there are over                                                           blood right now and here are a few that                                 you might be interested in if you're                                 working for with nonprofits open                                 outreach is a distribution specifically                                 focused on kind of grassroots and                                 activist organizations so if that's the                                 kind of work you're doing you should                                 look at that open public is a                                 distribution focused on government and                                 public policy work so if you're doing                                 that kind of work that's a good thing to                                 look at and julio is one of the few                                 distributions that doesn't start with                                 the word open apparently they didn't get                                 the memo that that's what we're all                                 doing there's no reason distributions                                 need to start with open i was just                                 kidding so it julio is focused on                                 education and school work so if you're                                 doing stuff in the education sector                                 julio                                 something you might want to look at like                                 I said there's over                                                   and org and they solve a lot of problems                                 that many organizations have but of                                 course they don't they don't solve every                                 problem distributions don't quite do                                 everything yet so that is the question                                 of what do you do if you if you look for                                 a distribution that solves your problems                                 and you don't find something what I want                                 to encourage you to do is make your own                                 distributions beyond distributions in                                 Drupal one of the big things you want to                                 encourage is nonprofit contributions                                 back to Drupal and making a distribution                                 is a great way to do that I'll talk a                                 little more about kind of the things you                                 want to look out for and doing that but                                 I want to be clear it's a lot of work to                                 make a distribution it's and like I said                                 before you may think you don't have the                                 time to do that one of the great things                                 about the open source community and                                 specifically the Drupal community is                                 that you don't have to do that work by                                 yourself there's a lot of other                                 organizations that have similar needs                                 and probably a lot in this room so just                                 to like kind of demonstrate that who                                 here is working with an organization                                 that is membership focus like you have                                 members of your organization okay so a                                 few of you have that need and might want                                 to work with each other who here is                                 doing a advocacy or like petition based                                 work a couple people so you should all                                 look around and see who else is raising                                 your hand those are the people you want                                 to work with so those are just a couple                                 general level needs of nonprofits and                                 obviously this is a relatively small                                 sampling of the larger Drupal community                                 so the point I want to make here is that                                 there there's other people who are                                 trying to solve the same problems you                                 are and we could all be working together                                 more to to solve these problems                                 and we can get a lot out of that that                                 brings us to collaboration so that's                                 like I've hopefully indicated that                                 sometimes easier said than done um                                 collaboration in the Drupal community                                 means we can save a lot of time and                                 money and often find better solutions                                 than we would on our own but the first                                 part of that is finding other people to                                 work with find who you want to                                 collaborate with and that can sometimes                                 be difficult to do there's so much                                 opportunity in the community to find                                 commonly needed solutions and work with                                 each other but the first step is                                 figuring out where to get started on                                 fortunately we have drupal.org for that                                 drupal.org is a great place to find                                 other people doing similar work and to                                 find other people who have already done                                 work that you need to do there's                                 thousands of active projects on                                 drupal.org and there's people talking                                 about creating new projects and people                                 working to solve new problems with                                 technology the slogan on Drupal that                                 organ kind of the slogan of Drupal is                                 come for the software is stay for the                                 community but you could really just come                                 for the community the community alone in                                 Drupal is useful enough by itself and                                 it's a huge community full of all sorts                                 of awesome people which hopefully you've                                 experienced at drupal cotton somewhat                                 and it's also made up of a bunch of                                 smaller communities that a lot of people                                 working with drupal kind of miss out on                                 that there's hundreds of groups and                                 groups that drupal org focused on kind                                 of specific interest groups and I want                                 to encourage you to get involved in some                                 of these that are specifically relevant                                 to nonprofit interests so there's a                                 Drupal and education group if you're                                 doing any sort of education work I'd                                 encourage you to get into that there's a                                 Drupal for government group if you're                                 doing anything that interacts with                                 government work that's a good place to                                 go hopefully almost everyone in this                                 room has a reason to join the Drupal for                                 good group but just in case you don't if                                 you're working for one of those rare                                 nonprofits that's focused on evil                                 there's also a Drupal for evil group                                 which i think is mostly a joke but it's                                 it's fun to see what kind of stuff what                                 kind of conversations happen in that                                 group there's also groups for most of                                 the distributions we've talked about                                 talking about how they're going to move                                 those forward so there's an open                                 outreach group a julio group and we're                                 just starting an open aid group beyond                                 groups on groups that drupal.org i'd                                 encourage you to get involved in issue                                 queues if you're doing drupal work                                 you're using modules and if you look at                                 the modules you're using or even modules                                 you're thinking about using you have a                                 ton to gain from getting to know the                                 people who make those modules so that                                 when you need to interact with them you                                 have a established relationship with                                 them and so the first thing is to go to                                 drupal org and just look through the                                 projects and find the projects that                                 you're actually using and the next step                                 is to start interacting with those                                 projects in the issue queue a lot of                                 people with less technical knowledge                                  think that they shouldn't be there they                                  shouldn't be doing that but even going                                  in to an issue queue and saying                                  something as simple as like this is what                                  I'm trying to do I don't see a way to do                                  this with your project even if it's not                                  specifically mentioned as a feature that                                  kind of input is incredibly useful for                                  project maintain errs to kind of get                                  ideas of what people want to be doing                                  and kind of start conversations about                                  what what's going to happen next in the                                  Drupal community more generally I think                                  a lot of people get into nonprofit work                                  because of ideas like this this is a                                  quote from Gandhi it's be the change you                                  want to see in the world and I would                                  encourage you to apply the same sort of                                  approach to your Drupal work on so you                                  don't have just like you you're not                                  waiting around to improve the world                                  you're actually doing something about it                                  you don't have to wait around for                                  anything to happen in the Drupal                                  community all you have to do is say like                                  I want to see this happen it's not going                                  to like                                  magically appear but there's no reason                                  to wait the Drupal community gives                                  everyone a lot of opportunity to create                                  change and like influence how Drupal                                  works so I would encourage everyone to                                  take advantage of that beyond groups and                                  issue queues and distributions there's                                  several other good ways to get involved                                  in the Drupal community one is IRC if                                  you're not already on IRC you might have                                  no idea what it is it's kind of a simple                                  chat system that is used pretty heavily                                  by the Drupal community and there's                                  dozens of chat rooms where people are                                  talking about the Drupal work they're                                  doing and here's a couple that are                                  specifically relevant to people working                                  with nonprofits there's a Drupal NGO                                  channel an IRC and there's a Drupal edu                                  channel and IRC allows you to do like                                  real-time chat with people all over the                                  world who are doing similar work to you                                  so it's a great place to have more more                                  direct communication with people in real                                  time another great place to do that is                                  local meetups most larger communities                                  have a monthly or more often drupal                                  meetup and if you're working somewhere                                  that doesn't you should start one on                                  local meetups are less likely to have                                  people who are doing the the type of                                  work you're doing but I'll have a lot of                                  people working in Drupal who can answer                                  questions or give you suggestions on how                                  you might solve problems with the work                                  that you're doing in Drupal and you can                                  find local meetups again on groups                                  drupal.org um another great place to get                                  together and like start talking to                                  people who are doing similar work is                                  events like this like drupalcon we're                                  kind of coming up to the end of                                  drupalcon now but there's still this                                  afternoon too there's still an                                  opportunity to like create buffs birds                                  of a feather discussions and get                                  together invite people who have similar                                  interests to work together with you and                                  there's also plenty                                  opportunity for hallway conversations if                                  you saw other people raise their hand                                  with similar interest to your own just                                  walk up and start talking to them find                                  out what they're doing talk about what                                  you're doing and hopefully start making                                  stuff together however your get involved                                  in the Drupal community I encourage you                                  to start with the most general needs                                  possible it's really easy to get                                  sidetracked as soon as you find out that                                  you have slightly different interests                                  but we found the best way to do this                                  kind of work is to start with common                                  interests solve your common problems                                  first and then once you have a solution                                  that will attract more people who have                                  that kind of general need and then you                                  can find people who have more specific                                  needs and get gradually more specific                                  and eventually find that person who is                                  doing the exact work that you're doing                                  but if you if you look for that if you                                  look for that perfect match up front you                                  probably won't find it so I'd encourage                                  you to start general and get slowly get                                  more specific don't focus on the                                  specific stuff at first so after you've                                  worked with the Drupal community and                                  made something another great thing to do                                  is to contribute it back many                                  organizations and I think specifically                                  nonprofits are using Drupal but not                                  contributing back and the reason for                                  that is that it takes a lot of time and                                  effort and money to contribute back but                                  you also can get a lot out of that so I                                  want to talk about how you can hopefully                                  make that work and the first part of                                  that is to recognize that contributions                                  won't just happen you you have to be                                  very intentional about it if you just I                                  don't know if you kind of think that                                  contributions would be nice but don't                                  take any don't put any thought into how                                  you're actually going to make that work                                  it very likely won't happen so open                                  eight as an example started as an idea                                  on our project team like hey maybe we                                  should contribute this on but it                                  eventually required the buy-in from a                                  lot of different people in five                                  different organizations and                                  that's a lot of communication overhead                                  so it's very important to kind of get                                  your your message together before you                                  start talking about it it can be a hard                                  sell to say hey let's take this thing                                  that we've put a lot of time and energy                                  into making and give it away for free                                  that fortunately with open aid that the                                  organization is working with K for                                  health and us ad were very receptive to                                  that but a lot of people aren't if                                  they're not already familiar with the                                  idea of open source so it here's some                                  some ways I encourage you to talk about                                  that that can get better receptions um                                  first I focus on the overlap between the                                  goals of your organization or the                                  organizations that you're working with                                  and open source ideals a lot of                                  nonprofit organizations if you look at                                  your mission statement or the mission                                  statement of the nonprofit you're                                  working with will say something about                                  promoting the greater good and                                  collaborating with others and that's                                  exactly what open source contributions                                  are their collaborations towards the                                  greater good on second contributions to                                  open source are great PR organizations                                  that contribute to open source kind of                                  position themselves as innovators in                                  their in their sector and kind of                                  thought leaders if if you're putting out                                  there something out there that other                                  people are using then they'll look to                                  you to kind of drive the direction of                                  your your market finally and perhaps                                  most importantly there's money in                                  contributions like Lydia said before a                                  lot of grant funders are looking                                  specifically for open source                                  contributions and prefer giving money to                                  organizations that are doing this kind                                  of contribution it's a lot better for                                  them to give money to you to help both                                  your organization and dozens or hundreds                                  or thousands of other organizations                                  rather than just only helping your                                  organization                                  as an example of this we've done some                                  work with the knight Foundation and are                                  very familiar with them they do a lot of                                  journalism and technology funding and                                  this is a quote from their blog that                                  says grants to nonprofits have an open                                  source requirement any software                                  developed with grant funds has to be                                  open source if a grant is made to a                                  business both the initial and future                                  releases of the code need to be open                                  sores so in this case they're actually                                  requiring open source contributions to                                  get money from them many other grant                                  funders are kind of happy about open                                  source but not going as far to require                                  it but the I don't know the the money is                                  definitely on the side of preferring                                  open source contributions to not so you                                  have a lot to gain money wise from that                                  so hopefully as you start talking about                                  how you're going to contribute you can                                  be confident that other organizations                                  are already doing this successfully and                                  kind of integrating it into their                                  overall strategy and hopefully all of                                  this kind of gives you an idea of some                                  confidence that there's money available                                  in working with Drupal with nonprofits                                  there's the technology is getting better                                  and better for undoing this work                                  efficiently and quickly and there's                                  definitely a huge community here eager                                  to help with this kind of work and like                                  Lydia said before this like using the                                  web effectively has never been more                                  important and it's not likely to get                                  less important so I'm Drupal's hopefully                                  a good place for you to start thinking                                  about and figuring out how to do that                                  well and we have a little time for                                  questions now we'd also love to hear                                  what everyone else is doing if you're                                  working with distributions or what your                                  experience has been with contributions                                  or like how you're working with Drupal                                  with nonprofits on I think will not use                                  that Mike and I'll                                  Street Pete questions so that we get                                  them recorded anyone                                  yeah so open with open aid we're                                  displaying projects which is like the                                  most general term we could give because                                  everyone wants to map something slightly                                  different but most people so there's two                                  main things people want to map one is                                  where they're working and one is where                                  they're located and so the more common                                  need that we identified was where                                  they're working so we we called that                                  projects but I mean you could take                                  projects and make that where you're                                  working or where you're located that as                                  far as the technology we're using for                                  that we have in the past and open aid                                  comes with an open layer solution and I                                  think the default design of that is                                  using matte box if you're familiar with                                  that with which the specific tileset                                  we're using is semi-transparent so you                                  can that the the color branding of open                                  aid uses follows through to the map as                                  well so we're using a semi transparent                                  background and then you just put a color                                  behind in that follows through I don't                                  know if that's clear enough but that                                  that color influences the kind of the                                  texture of the map recently we've been                                  working more with more specific mapping                                  solutions openlayers is kind of a I                                  don't know it aims to solve all mapping                                  problems and it can sometimes be a lot                                  of code overhead we've been working a                                  lot with for example leaflet recently                                  and that doesn't do as much but it does                                  it more quickly I don't know if it's                                  hopefully that's helpful oh sorry i said                                  i was going to repeat questions that i                                  didn't so the question was now that I                                  answered it off the question was what                                  are we doing with mapping how are we                                  doing that I think                                  where is it                                  stay                                     drupal in academia meet up at                                             the st. Monica's room in this building                                  yeah I just it was easy the package but                                  you did not work with really um I don't                                  know might be my second here so his                                  comment was he installed open aid while                                  we were talking it worked well with the                                  package download but not well with drush                                  um that's I so like I said making                                  distributions takes work on and it's                                  also new in how much work i think that                                  depends on what you're doing we've liked                                  so I said we have our own like internal                                  development distribution that didn't                                  take that much work because we've just                                  kind of like as we want to add new                                  things to it we've just done that in                                  bits and pieces and that's not something                                  that we've like set aside work to do we                                  just slowly built that up internally                                  something like open aid that it's hard                                  to say because we that came out of like                                  we had a actual schedule for the work                                  for like most of the work on that but                                  then we did some additional work in kind                                  of the as we had time on gosh I don't                                  candy of any estimate on how much time                                  we put into that definitely weeks of                                  work if not months so but what I was                                  saying is um distributions are also kind                                  of new on drupal.org and we're still                                  kind of working out the kinks of making                                  distributions work part of which is like                                  distributions get packaged on drupal.org                                  with drush but you need a very specific                                  set up of drush to make that work so                                  that might be the issue is                                  it you might need to upgrade your drush                                  but this I probably shouldn't be trying                                  to do support here I anyone else                                  questions or want to share your                                  experience yeah okay Oh                                  yeah so open it has kind of a I don't                                  know if open aid has art that our                                  designers here as well so I thought he                                  might want to answer um I it's hard to                                  open a definitely has like it it's                                  general enough that you can probably                                  recognize an open eight side and but at                                  the same time that's just your basis and                                  your you can definitely customize it                                  from there if that's useful for you on                                  the idea is just that it gives you                                  something you can use that looks good                                  out of the box and if you if if heavily                                  branding your organization visually is                                  important to you you're probably going                                  to want to do some significant                                  customization because like you said open                                  eight sites definitely have kind of a                                  common look to them just like I don't                                  know a default Drupal site out of the                                  box you can kind of recognize that just                                  by looking at it so yeah and we're                                  definitely welcome to input on how we                                  can make that more customizable but yeah                                  you're right that if you want a very                                  specific look you're probably going to                                  you'll need to do some customizing there                                  oh sorry I did it again so that the                                  comment was that the I ever maybe the                                  question was about customizing the look                                  and feel right now it is just changing                                  the logo and shifting the color scheme                                  those are your only options with the                                  theme that comes with opening but you                                  can change that theme if you want yeah                                  with fundraising yes yes video um so the                                  question was about fundraising that is                                  not that's definitely on our feature                                  list for open aid for future features um                                  fundraising is complicated because                                  you're right that most nonprofits need                                  to do that but there's a wide variety of                                  ways in which they do that some take                                  direct donations I'm have some sort of                                  membership or subscription system some                                  are actually selling selling some sort                                  of product or membership product so and                                  there's also a lot of nonprofits are                                  already working with specific payment                                  processors so it's hard to find a                                  solution for that that's generally                                  useful and like I said we're kind of                                  focusing on the the common solutions                                  first but yeah we're definitely looking                                  at ways that we can do that in a way                                  that will be useful for a variety of                                  organizations I'm not sure if open                                  outreach you might want to look at that                                  i'm not sure if they have some sort of                                  way to accept donations in the open                                  outreach distribution but yeah that                                  that's definitely a problem that needs                                  solving but it's also a hard problem to                                  solve for everyone at once so good                                  question I don't have a great answer                                  yeah                                  um                                  so                                  what yeah                                  I in case anyone didn't hear that or for                                  the recording he said that there he's                                  working on or with a distribution that                                  does crowdsource funding i guess yeah                                  sort of like Kickstarter which is one                                  way to take money yeah so if you're                                  interested in that you should talk to                                  that guy anything else think we're
