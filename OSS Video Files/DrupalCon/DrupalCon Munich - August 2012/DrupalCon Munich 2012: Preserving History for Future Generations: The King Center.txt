Description: 
	There are few figures who have had as great an impact on the history of the last century as civil rights leader and social activist Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The King Center is an organization founded by Coretta Scott King after her husband's assassination in 1968 that serves as a living memorial to Dr. King and helps promote his philosophy of using nonviolent methods to address social problems and economic inequality.

The King Center houses an archive of an estimated one million historic documents, including correspondence, speeches, handwritten notes, and photographs relating to Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement. Among these items are early drafts of famous speeches by Dr. King, letters and telegrams that he received from world leaders, and handwritten notecards where he jotted down his thoughts on race, religion, philosophy, and other topics.

In 2011, the King Center embarked on a massive effort to preserve and digitize these documents, which were previously not available to the public. As part of this project, the King Center needed a new website to enable people everywhere to learn firsthand from the wealth of knowledge stored in the King Center archives and other collections and to help the organization better connect with a new generation of people who have been inspired by Dr. King and his philosophy.

Working in collaboration with industry leaders in design, digital imaging and archiving, cloud storage, and technical strategy, including JPMorgan Chase, C&G Partners, Microstrategies, and EMC, Palantir.net built a Drupal site that integrates seamlessly with an Alfresco-based document repository utilizing Atmos cloud storage for performance and scalability.

The site's design-forward look and feel highlights material from the collection for first-time visitors and also provides sophisticated tools that enable researchers to dig deep into the collection. To implement the site's design, Palantir leveraged the Zen theme framework, which enabled the creation of sophisticated page layouts, as well as the latest CSS3 techniques, the Sass stylesheet language, and the open source Compass CSS framework.

To create a document viewer for the Digital Archive that was compatible with a wide variety of browsers and devices, the jQuery JavaScript library was utilized. Standard plugins were extended with custom code in order to create the site's distinct user interface.

Extensive pre-launch testing was conducted to ensure that the site accommodate an unknown amount of launch traffic. On launch day, the King Center site received a tremendous amount of publicity from international news outlets such as BBC News, USA Today, ABC News, CNN, and others. The site was also promoted at Madison Square Garden and on 16,000 Chase ATMs throughout the United States.

This treasure trove of material is not only a valuable resource for students, educators, and academics, but it's also a great tool for community activists and others around the world seeking social change. The site is not only a great showcase for Drupal's capabilities, but also a fantastic example of how Drupal can be used in combination with other technologies to help share knowledge and information that can help make the world a better place.

King and his wife Coretta Scott King and                                 they had this entire just huge massive                                 operation that was all centered around                                 pulling the documents out of the                                 archives going through them ensuring                                 that they were catalogued and organized                                 in a in a way that would make them                                 findable again in the future that the                                 documents the physical documents                                 themselves were being preserved with you                                 know acid-free paper and archival                                 material that the documents were being                                 scanned that the metadata was being                                 applied so there were actually these                                 documents were were being reviewed by                                 groups of Kings scholars historians and                                 other researchers who would look at                                 these documents kind of figure out what                                 they were about provide abstract as well                                 as keywords to ensure that folks would                                 be able to know what they were invited                                 so this is kind of the operation they                                 had set up this is an actual digital                                 imaging station they had and this was a                                 custom created by the folks of imaging                                 etc and it was really informed by a lot                                 of work that had been done with actually                                 the Kennedy Library which had kind of a                                 few years earlier it had a lot of                                 similar needs around this sort of                                 preserving massive amounts of documents                                 so this is a imaging station the vacuum                                 would be light down here on this table                                 in the center you'd have the camera                                 above that would take the image of the                                 photo and then it would go into various                                 programs and other stations from                                 processing and                                 and archiving so overall project goals                                 this was to help the King Center better                                 connect with new generation in improve                                 awareness of dr. King's philosophy the                                 king center is an organization that that                                 hasn't gotten a lot of attention you                                 know it's it's a very well respected                                 organization because the involvement of                                 dr. King's family and it really are the                                 bearers of his legacy but they're not                                 they're not a hugely funded organization                                 there there there a small organization                                 and they have traditionally had very                                 limited resources for reaching out to to                                 the wider public of course to provide                                 access to all of these documents that                                 the public has never seen before and                                 we'll kind of talk a little bit about                                 what they are and because our assignment                                 was to launch this site on dr. Martin                                 Luther King Day to be able to withstand                                 the massive amount of traffic that we                                 were anticipating with a very highly                                 publicized launch so to step back a                                 little bit and give you a little bit of                                 a history this was about in august of                                 last year late July actually I got a                                 call from folks at at CNG partners and                                 they wanted to chat with me about this                                 project and so I took the call and what                                 they said what it was they said you are                                 you interested and I said hell yes and                                 then and then we started talking about                                 the timeline and realizing that this was                                 an incredibly ambitious project that I                                 had to be put together in a very short                                 amount of time with a lot of different                                 players all those different partners a                                 lot of different moving pieces but we                                 knew that this was a project that was                                 important enough that we were going to                                 do what we needed to do to make                                 work so this is kind of the the                                 technology stack that would have went                                 into it obviously Drupal was used for                                 the website alfresco was the system that                                 was used to store all of the digital                                 assets atmos was the cloud platform                                 provided by AT&T and EMC that serves all                                 of the images to the website jquery and                                 SAS of course were our kind of front-end                                 technologies so sex part I may get a                                 little bit technical not terribly                                 technical because quite honestly I'm a                                 business guy I don't really understand                                 how all of the technology works but I                                 had a few conversations with Arthur                                 foolish and Beck White who or two of                                 engineers Arthur was actually the                                 technical lead on this project and so I                                 think they've given me just enough                                 information to be dangerous so if I if I                                 mangle anything apologies so the archive                                 the image the the after we go through                                 that whole process where all the images                                 are scanned and digitized and all the                                 data is applied and everything those are                                 managed in alfresco are you guys pretty                                 much familiar with alfresco who raised                                 hands ok so al fresco is another open                                 source content management platform                                 similar to Drupal although while Drupal                                 is a is optimized for web publishing and                                 web application development alfresco is                                 really designed around document                                 management asset management that sort of                                 use case and and so we knew because we                                 were working with Drupal that we would                                 be able to talk with alfresco we weren't                                 responsible for the alfresco                                 implementation so we we did what we                                 could to make sure that we had a really                                 close connection with that team who was                                 responsible I'll cover that in a little                                 bit so the archive assets so the actual                                 images themselves that get fed to the                                 website are stored in the cloud using                                 eighteen t synaptic storage is a service                                 which is a platform built on top of emc                                 Atmos the website as I said before is                                 hosted on aquas managed cloud using the                                 Amazon Web Services Platform and we                                 built the website in Drupal                                         among many other modules views Zen for                                 the base theme and on the front end                                 which I'll demonstrate we had some                                 pretty pretty heavy needs for                                 interactive functionality so that                                 involved css                                                             this is kind of the overview document of                                 how things worked so we've got and that                                 this is this is the one that's makes my                                 head spin a little bit but I'll do my                                 best to walk through it so the end user                                 here gets information that's fed to them                                 both from the Drupal website and images                                 that are fed to them through from a from                                 atmos so the images live in Atmos the                                 rest of the website lives in Drupal                                 alfresco feeds images to the Drupal site                                 which then runs them through a queue                                 creates derivatives throws them up to                                 Atmos we then use the migrate module to                                 pull the non-image the non document data                                 the metadata and whatnot from alfresco                                 once again run it through Drupal queues                                 throw it out to the node then use Drupal                                 to tie these two things together might                                 be asking why don't you have the image                                 content living on the same server as the                                 Drupal site the reason for that is we                                 had access to this fantastic atmos cloud                                                                                                       amount of storage and this was for                                 scalability the number of documents in                                 the archive is around a million and then                                 the number that we wanted to be able to                                 put online totaled at you know a couple                                 hundred thousand and so based on on our                                 storage requirement                                 we we knew that putting it on the same                                 in the same place as the Drupal server                                 was not going to work so we can't we                                 kept the Drupal stuff on Drupal have the                                 images on                                                             then we use Drupal to tie them together                                 and serve them to the user so just kind                                 of digging in a little bit into the way                                 that we hold the metadata out of of                                 alfresco in this case we we took the                                 migrated module and we integrated that                                 with alfresco CMS interface CMAs is the                                 kind of API standard that al fresco and                                 a few other cmss uses it's kind of an                                 open standard Drupal doesn't actually                                 have a lot of really great support for                                 cmas there is a scene this module but                                 for this use case and for the very kind                                 of limited amount of stuff we were doing                                 and on the advice of the alfresco team                                 we decided to kind of minimize use of                                 that as much as possible and really lean                                 heavily on the on the migrate module to                                 pull stuff in this was needed to be very                                 very buscus as you can see some some                                 documents i have over a you know                                     related pages images lots of different                                 fields associated with each one also                                 enabled us to be able to use use                                 alfresco authoritative place if we                                 needed to to take anything off the                                 website for any reason if we had a                                 document that went up before it was                                 ready or if there was some information                                 that was wrong that can be pushed to                                 Drupal from alfresco                                 drupal queues and this is this is where                                 we're kind of testing the limits of my                                 technical knowledge here but we this was                                 essentially used for basically                                 generating the images so we would have                                 the images pulled in and they would                                 start off in their raw form somewhere                                 between four megabytes and                                               bytes they're being scanned at about                                 belief                                                                   pretty large in size and then we use the                                 triple Q's to create derivatives both a                                 primary and a secondary derivative and                                 we pushed those out to the Atlas cloud                                 for serving to the end user yeah in                                 preparation for launch we actually had                                 to have                                                                generate the derivatives we we launched                                 with somewhere in the neighborhood of                                 ten thousand documents in the archives                                 so and that all happened in the kind of                                 final two weeks before launch so we just                                 kind of threw a whole bunch of                                 processing power at it so the atmos file                                 storage we created a custom stream                                 wrapper that connected again from Drupal                                 to add most services we track the atmos                                 IDs and then translated that to match                                 the information we have already in                                 Drupal from the from the information                                 we've pulled in from alfresco via my                                 grade and we had to be very careful                                 about how we set this up especially                                 during development to make sure that                                 while we wanted our our developer our                                 production environment to be able to you                                 know to remove images if necessary we                                 didn't want the stage in development                                 environments to be able to do so                                 so I'm going to switch gears a little                                 bit and talk kind of about the process                                 and collaboration how we made this work                                 with all these different players all                                 these different technologies to play                                 everything was in a state of very rapid                                 development as I said we came on at the                                 end of July we had our kickoff meeting                                 at the beginning of August at the King                                 Center we actually were not able to                                 begin production in earnest until                                 November Martin Luther King Day is                                 actually the third week of January so we                                 had a very very limited amount of time                                 to make all of this work for a very very                                 ambitious project so having really good                                 project management and coordination was                                 absolutely vital to the success of this                                 project at palantir we use red my the                                 red mine ticketing system to manage our                                 projects and tickets what we do with red                                 mine is we actually have we expose those                                 tickets not just internally but also to                                 our client so the client is able to                                 review tickets to see the progress                                 that's going on is able to comment is                                 able to create new tickets as needed we                                 also shared some of those with some of                                 the other partners working on the                                 project we had regular scheduled                                 check-ins between our technical team and                                 the the different partners particularly                                 the folks at microStrategy's the                                 alfresco team and the folks at CNG who                                 are doing the design those were kind of                                 regularly scheduled progress updates                                 very kind of simple you know identifying                                 what blockers were how progress was                                 going for both microStrategy's and CNG                                 partners as well as the folks involved                                 in the overall project management at                                 JPMorgan Chase we had kind of as well as                                 folks that aqua closer to launch we had                                 kind of a back-channel hotlines going so                                 if we're working for example on                                 something related to the alfresco CMS                                 integration                                 and we're running into a blocker and we                                 need some question answered we were able                                 to pick up the phone call someone over                                 at microStrategy's and get an answer                                 right away so that didn't block our                                 effort you know similarly if one of the                                 folks from jpmorgan chase wants to know                                 what's going on how we're doing get a                                 check in in addition to the regular                                 scheduled calls they can also contact us                                 directly we also set up and this is                                 really important I think for anyone                                 who's working on a project like this                                 where you've got these these sort of                                 challenges we had weekly executive calls                                 and these were calls between between me                                 at palantir between our lead project                                 manager at jpmorgan chase & between the                                 the other one of the principles at CNG                                 partners and this was a check-in call                                 particularly as we got toward the kind                                 of second half the later stages of the                                 project where we would be able to deal                                 with issues that had basically bubbled                                 up or escalated and hadn't been dealt                                 with through the regular check-in                                 process so that then we were able to go                                 back to our teams and say you know what                                 we really need to take care of this                                 issue because this one is really                                 important and you know to identify the                                 sorts of things that were necessary for                                 launch so my next few slides are                                 actually some screenshots of the site                                 but I'm going to do something that's a                                 little bit dangerous and I'm actually                                 going to try to show you the pages on                                 the live site which I try to never do in                                 a presentation but i think it will give                                 you a little bit of a better experience                                 a better understanding of what this site                                 was like and if it doesn't work out for                                 any reason i still have my pretty slides                                 so let me                                 there we are excellent so this is the                                 the homepage of the King Center site                                 we've got a few sort of rotating home                                 page features talk about sort of                                 different different major key stories                                 and can be helpful if we kind of jumped                                 right into the archive this is a section                                 of the archive on intersecting movements                                 the way that dr. King worked with and                                 coordinated with a wide variety of                                 different groups were all kind of                                 attacking the the problems from this the                                 issues faced by the civil rights                                 movement from different perspectives and                                 so you have a lot of a lot of different                                 information on here so so the the basic                                 view in the archive the default view is                                 the sort of tile view this is all kind                                 of randomly generated you can see when                                 you scroll over you get some information                                 about each of the each of the items in                                 the archive so maybe we'll just go to                                 this one so this                                 oh yeah we scroll down we actually load                                 some more this is kind of an endless                                 scroll very cool effect this is all done                                 with jquery i'm going to just pull up                                 this particular item right here again                                 this is all using a jquery there's not a                                 single bit of flash used on this site                                 that was really important we we have                                 tried it out on an ipad it seems to work                                 pretty well even though that wasn't one                                 of the the platforms that we were                                 testing for you can get a kind of a                                 sense here you can obviously a view view                                 the document move it around zoom in and                                 view view it up close so i think we're                                 kind of loading in the higher resolution                                 version there view the abstract for the                                 document that just in a very brief                                 couple sentences tell us what it's about                                 some of these have                                 this particular document doesn't many of                                 the documents have actually transcribed                                 versions particularly for dr. King's                                 canvas and speeches and then we also                                 have all sorts of the different genre                                 topics and other kind of metadata                                 associated with it so that you can find                                 related information what's also really                                 cool about this and I will talk about                                 this little more relational launch are                                 these social media sharing tools                                 enabling folks to use Twitter or                                 Facebook or other social media to                                 actually link to a specific document and                                 tell their friends about it this was                                 something that was really really cool to                                 watch on launch day again kind of going                                 back to one of our major goals which was                                 to increase public awareness of dr.                                 King's work to provide more than just                                 that kind of very you know shallow brief                                 overview that they might have already                                 and to really kind of dig into who this                                 man was what he did and what he was                                 talking about there are some amazing                                 amazing items in these archives in                                 addition to some of the highlights I                                 know we have a handwritten version of                                 his Nobel Prize speech we have an early                                 draft of the march on Washington speech                                 the I have a dream speech that doesn't                                 have I have a dream in it yet we have                                 one of my favorite favorite things                                 these notecards so these note cards are                                 actually little handwritten index cards                                 that dr. King had and these are just                                 little ideas and he would write these                                 down inners there's dozens of these and                                 he would just write down different ideas                                 or thoughts or concepts that he wanted                                 to think about and to have it as                                 disposal on he would use these when he                                 was putting together speeches and                                 writings and these are all hand written                                 by him these are just sort of amazing                                 things for folks to have access to and                                 it really demonstrates the depth of his                                 thinking not just about civil rights but                                 about matters of spirituality the                                 nonviolent philosophy non-violence                                 philosophy ways to bring together what                                 he called the Beloved Community as well                                 as his major principles so jumping back                                 to these slides here                                 yeah this is this is actually right this                                 is the draft of the Nobel Prize speech                                 just one of the really great highlights                                 you can see where he's crossed out                                 things and changed his words it's really                                 really cool and you can kind of get lost                                 in this one thing I forgot to mention                                 you saw that tile view at the beginning                                 for folks who are maybe looking for a                                 particular document we also have really                                 great search tools and there's also a                                 more standard kind of list view where                                 you can browse content and actually see                                 the information without hovering over it                                 but be the idea behind the tiles is                                 really to give folks kind of a sense of                                 discovery as they're going through the                                 archive so launch we had no idea how                                 much traffic this site we get what we                                 did know was that there was a lot of                                 publicity plan for it and we had                                 essentially the entire weight of                                 JPMorgan Chase's marketing and PR                                 department behind promoting this launch                                 so we decided to be prepared and we we                                 worked with the folks at aqua as well as                                 the folks hasta who specializes in cloud                                 hosting we ran pre-launch performance                                 testing we ran a couple different rounds                                 of it tweaking every time as we go we                                 made a few tweaks to the site made a lot                                 of tweaks to the server configuration to                                 make sure that we could hit our numbers                                 and we actually ended up successfully                                 testing                                                               users and so the kind of metric here is                                 basically what if                                                        clicked at once on a page on the site we                                 wanted to be sure that we could handle                                 that kind of traffic as it turns out on                                 launch day we were covered BBC News USA                                 Today ABC News was actually mentioned on                                 the evening news CNN had both a                                 broadcast story on CNN Headline News                                 also on their website a whole bunch of                                 different international me                                 the outlets talking about it chase.com                                 was promoting the site on their homepage                                 they had a they had a special promotion                                 at madison square garden at the the                                 Knicks games that were going on that                                 week it was in addition to a exhibit                                 booth which we'll see in a minute they                                 also had a on the jumbotron they were                                 also promoting it so you know so                                 everyone in theory could have tried to                                 pull out their phones and trying to                                 access the site at once so that was                                 something we were looking out for and of                                 course on                                                              cash machines or Germany a gyal taught a                                 lot and so they were promoting those on                                 those homepage screens so we ended up                                 actually serving only about                                         unique visitors on launch day which was                                 a couple or a few orders of magnitude                                 below the amount of traffic that we                                 could accommodate so everything went                                 very smoothly everyone was very happy                                 with the launch and because we were                                 hosted in the cloud we were actually                                 able to you know after we've done this                                 massive scaling up to get ready for                                 launch day we were actually able to very                                 quickly and easily scale the servers                                 back down so that we could handle you                                 know the more kind of everyday amounts                                 of traffic after launch was over so yeah                                 this is this is actually the screen from                                 my local bank back home this is this is                                 the the message that was on the ATM                                 screen so so that was launched that was                                 in January we took a few weeks off we                                 all caught our breaths and then we                                 started on phase                                                        actually believed in its final throes of                                 development right now and should be                                 launching very soon is share your dream                                 so share your                                 dream and this this goes back to a                                 larger part of the promotion around this                                 effort was about getting people to                                 engage with with dr. King's ideas and to                                 engage with the archive and to really                                 put themselves out there by writing down                                 their dreams and sharing them so share                                 your dream will allow folks to submit                                 and share their dreams online we also                                 have as you'll see a ton of dreams that                                 we that have already been collected that                                 are going to be to be a shared online at                                 launch and this you know Lego set ties                                 into the larger initiative to encourage                                 engagement and to help provide folks                                 with a deeper understanding of dr.                                 King's philosophy so this is an exhibit                                 booth this was created by the folks at                                 sanji partners and a lot of the the                                 branding and design and everything                                 really derives from the work that they                                 did for this boot that they had one of                                 these at at madison square garden in new                                 york city before launch they had one of                                 these set up in Washington DC for the                                 unveiling of the dedication of the dr                                 king memorial which went up last august                                 and when you go into the booth you'll                                 see there's this kind of dream wall in                                 the background and the dream wall is                                 where they've kind of physically put up                                 all of these notes with all of these                                 dreams that people have written down as                                 they walked into the booth and shared                                 them and this is one of our volunteers                                 here is manning the booth to see she's                                 got all this all this paper and notes                                 where you can write down you'll get a                                 piece of paper you can write down your                                 dream and then what's really cool is so                                 they take the dream and they actually                                 have like a little like simulated                                 digital archiving scanning                                 camera right there in the booth and so                                 they take the digital image of the booth                                 and so if you remember we took a look at                                 that was the one that was actually                                 located in the things that our archives                                 themselves this is just a kind of a                                 little mini version of that so it                                 obviously is not capturing things that                                 archival quality but what it is is                                 capturing them at a resolution that we                                 can use on the web and so these are the                                 actual designs created by CNG partners                                 for the share your dream feature so we                                 have a these note cards and the idea is                                 that we want folks to be able to take a                                 look at dreams and explore them by                                 keyword and by geographic regions so you                                 can kind of see you know if you're you                                 know dream is about love you can click                                 on love and you can kind of see all the                                 different places and dreams that people                                 have had about love and you know where                                 they come from we also have yeah so this                                 is actually a close-up of one of the                                 dreams you can see you know we're using                                 kind of tag clouds where folks in this                                 region are dreaming about the different                                 ideas that are expressed in here from                                 the transcription that's taken as well                                 as kind of the larger geographical map                                 so this is where folks in the United                                 States are dreaming about happiness and                                 so that is of course it's it's simulated                                 this is all from the the design comps                                 but when we launch we're going to use                                 that information that's been taken from                                 this booth that's been touring around as                                 well as allow people to add their own                                 information online to this feature                                 so that's the material I have and so if                                 folks have any questions I'd be more                                 than happy to answer them i also have a                                 few links to some resources obviously                                 getting center org are the case study                                 page on palantir net where we talked                                 about the project fellow palantir on                                 twitter follow me on twitter if you want                                 i usually tweet about non Drupal things                                 but it's if you want to and then of                                 course make sure you rate the session                                 and evaluate and I'm actually going to                                 be talking about this project at a few                                 other events this fall and so really                                 help for me to understand kind of what I                                 hit well if I talked about some of the                                 things you wanted to hear about if there                                 were things about the project then I                                 didn't talk about that you all had to                                 hear about and of course let me know if                                 you have questions raise your hand                                 yes no well so so we actually we closed                                 the palantir between between Christmas                                 and New Year and what we did is we                                 actually timed that along with the                                 client QA period so well well all of our                                 folks got that break then that was the                                 period during which the folks you know                                 on the client side were reviewing and                                 submitting QA tickets we came back at                                 the beginning of January we had                                 basically a week and a half to address                                 the QA we we did not we did not get a                                 team on the pentair side I think they                                 were probably around half a dozen of us                                 working on the project simultaneously I                                 don't have the exact figures it kind of                                 feels like that just based on my                                 recollection we definitely had folks who                                 put in long hours on this but we we also                                 have really we had a really great                                 project manager on the project and she                                 was really really good about making sure                                 as we went through and of course you                                 know the scope of the project and change                                 you know when we got started it was you                                 know this this share your dream                                 functionality was you know originally                                 going to be part of the the original                                 launch scope and you know we had to cut                                 back a few times in order to you know                                 reach that kind of minimum you know                                 viable experience for launch and so we                                 were just really really careful about                                 that you know we monitored our burn                                 rates and resourcing and you know the                                 scope very carefully again that was that                                 really direct coordination particularly                                 with the folks you know at JP Morgan to                                 make sure that                                 we were managing expectations properly                                 and that we weren't going to get into a                                 position where you know someone was                                 going to get in over their heads so                                 that's yeah I mean we definitely had                                 folks who put in long hours on it but I                                 think we were by and large able to kind                                 of preserve people's thanksgiving and                                 christmas pretty well other questions                                 alright well thank you all very much
