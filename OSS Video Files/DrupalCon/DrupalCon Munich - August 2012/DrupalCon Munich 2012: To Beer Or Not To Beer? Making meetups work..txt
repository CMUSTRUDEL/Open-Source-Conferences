Title: DrupalCon Munich 2012: To Beer Or Not To Beer? Making meetups work.
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Munich - August 2012
Description: 
	"Come for the software, stay for the Community". The Drupal Community as a whole is compiled of many smaller, local communities. If the smaller communities did not exist, where would the Drupal Community really live? This panel will discuss how different meetups in different regions around the globe work (or don't work) and how to make them better. This will be an open discussion, moderated and lead by the panel, about what we are doing at our different meetups that we believe are bringing repeat attendees.

We hope that after this discussion we will all walk away with some new ideas on how to help grow our local meetups and in-turn our local communities, with better, more exciting meetup content; bring back attendees every time; and encourage new attendees.

Further resources
During the preparation of this session we conducted a survey polling informations from meetups around the globe. Resources for Drupal Meetup Organizers summarises the findings and advice from this survey.

A Social Media Advisory has been written to accompany COD (Conference Organizing Distribution of Drupal). This contains many helpful tips and advice on how to market Drupal events. This will be regularly updated as part of an initiative to help Drupal event organisers succeed.
