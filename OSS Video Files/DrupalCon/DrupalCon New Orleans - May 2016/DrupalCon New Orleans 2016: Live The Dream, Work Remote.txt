right room if you're here to learn about

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,790
how to live the dream work remote and

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,530
build a successful Drupal shop my name

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,689
is Ann Stepanek I'm the founding CEO of

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,090
canopy studios were a fully distributed

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,400
shop I'm based out of San Francisco I've

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,250
been working in Drupal since 46 back in

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,049
the days of flexi note i purposely when

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,140
i started canopy studios it was a bit of

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,729
an accident actually but when i decided

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,770
to start the company i decided to start

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,030
it fully distributed i did this more

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,340
because i needed some life for

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,950
flexibility and I I wasn't too keen on

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,850
having a job at the time so today we're

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,170
going to talk about some of the things

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,450
that I've learned over the last three

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,049
and a half four years on how to run a

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,649
shop and how to manage team members so

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,479
first off I want to start off with this

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,810
slide because I believe that everybody

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,790
has a why and I mean everybody this

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,380
could be the reason why they get up in

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,149
the morning a lot of people is to feed

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,740
their families some people it's because

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,299
they want to work so they have lifestyle

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,820
flexibility so they can write a novel or

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,170
a screenplay personally I want to go

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,179
build tree houses and I don't know very

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,879
many companies that will just let me go

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,569
and build treehouses so if you want to

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,510
check out that website it's think of

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,950
net so why I bring this up is it's

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,749
really important whether you're deciding

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,519
yourself to work with a virtual company

00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:23,109
or if you're looking at turning into a

00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,209
virtual company it's really important to

00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,889
understand the why this is understanding

00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,709
your why as to why you want to do this

00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,480
and other people's wise whenever I do

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,709
interviews with talent and we're

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,019
questioning them and going through all

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,549
the you know technical processes and

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,870
figuring out if they're a good fit I

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,030
always ask them what's their main

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,180
passion in life and if they say Drupal

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,260
I'm going to go finish it because

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,079
everybody does something outside of the

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,459
computer and I love Drupal to I run the

00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,379
Bay Area triple camp in San Francisco

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,879
with a group of awesome volunteers and

00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,400
Drupal is definitely a large passion of

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,469
mine but ultimately i really love

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,400
building things with my hands and the

00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:01,870
trees so let's talk a little bit more as

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,180
we think about this we're going to talk

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,769
a little bit more about how the rise of

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,250
the digital workplace has come in to

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,900
effect there's about 30 million people

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,579
today that work from home and that

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,379
person is expected to raise to about

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,659
forty three percent over the next five

00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:19,180
years so over half of our workforce will

00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,129
be distributed there's a reality that

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,169
there's a decentralized the

00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:25,379
decentralized workforce knows that they

00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:29,290
no longer need a traditional job anymore

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:31,780
the old luxury was the corner office the

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,299
luxury car the nice expense account and

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,579
then the new luxury which being from San

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,939
Francisco I see a lot of this is the

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,769
free lunches the if you think of Google

00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,840
for example they've got the fancy chef

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,340
they got the snack room they've got the

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,859
massage room they have the ping pong

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,629
table ultimately in the end it's not

00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,549
much different than the old luxury

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,939
because they encourage endless hours at

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,680
the office today we want to talk about

00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:01,599
the new luxury which is freedom of space

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,759
and time so now it's less and less about

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,099
the 925 and it's more about delivering

00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,659
results full-time permanent jobs with

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:12,969
large organizations are a thing of the

00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:17,049
past like 50 years ago so long gone is

00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:19,090
the organizational guy very few like my

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,760
mom has had three different careers even

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,680
in her age so the generation that we're

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,389
dealing with here is that very few

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,480
people hold a job for more than five to

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,770
seven years and it's

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,060
very frequent that a person will

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,800
reinvent themselves three times so I

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,480
wanted to show you this video there's a

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,650
company out there called digital nomads

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,970
and this is one of their recruiting

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,740
videos and I just wanted to say that

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,750
this really vibes on the essence of what

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:56,870
it is to kind of live and work the dream

00:04:41,750 --> 00:05:05,180
so hopefully if this all works I'm going

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:08,090
to do this for a second I used have to

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,310
fly literally a million miles a year you

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,830
add that up that's a lot of wasted time

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,780
my commute to work it was actually quite

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,700
laborious i was living in london i would

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,380
have to walk to catch the tube and then

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,910
I'd be squished on the tube like every

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,920
single other person stuck in the rat

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,540
race and then I had to repeat it all on

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,540
the way home always in rush hour

00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:31,939
it's exciting every day is a new

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,289
adventure ten years ago I never thought

00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:35,120
I'd be able to do this but i can

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,699
actually we can be in the middle of the

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,800
Arctic Circle in Greenland and doing our

00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:42,580
job I would consider myself a digital

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,710
limit somebody who has the freedom to

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,629
work anywhere in the world where we want

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,310
when we want based on digital tools

00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:51,919
people need access to a computer and the

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,810
Internet to have an office and not so

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,569
much to real estate it's no longer about

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,430
95 it's about results the more free to

00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:00,469
my team had the more work they got done

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,960
I do believe that you can build your

00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:04,639
work and your business around your

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,650
lifestyle I basically live out of my

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,569
suitcase travel the world and run my

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,729
online business with the help of a

00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,139
virtual team around the world I've been

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,689
chopping the world for over 10 years

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,360
straight and everything I own comes with

00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,789
me the eco rumor is a huge hulking truck

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,919
that we live in the back up and it's

00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:23,270
also the global headquarters of my my

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,759
company of him looking left my

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,710
traditional job when I had my son

00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,449
instead of going back I wrote my goals

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,759
and decided what my work-life balance

00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,270
would look like and what was best for me

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
and my

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,480
Emily and that's how i came up with

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,160
being a digital nomad and being able to

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,460
work for myself gives me the opportunity

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,830
to grow it when I like to work and I can

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,000
go surfing when I like to serve and it

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,070
shouldn't be that only the most

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,080
innovative companies embrace this moment

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,350
i think the 10 years from now it

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,500
absolutely will be the norm there are so

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,740
many reasons why this is a great way to

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,740
work

00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,430
freedom and my world means buying

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:17,889
experiences not stuff and that makes you

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:26,550
feel rich in ways that money can never

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:26,550
ever buy cool let's get off of that now

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,029
okay thinking about this figured out

00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:36,849
here one second so that's kind of the

00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,529
the essence of why I wanted to work

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,210
remote as I couldn't deal with the

00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,580
commute I couldn't deal with the office

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,159
I am a very early morning person in a

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,900
very late person and at this time when I

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,089
was looking for jobs there's very few

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,639
things that were available to me in that

00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:55,659
sense so I'm going to try this opening

00:07:51,639 --> 00:08:00,120
again and slide this sucker over and

00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:00,120
then we should be good to go beside me

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,810
not

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:16,130
then go okay great okay let's talk a

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,540
little bit about some of the company

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,340
motivations so if you're an agency that

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,380
you're thinking about going to be a

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,330
virtual team you are definitely going to

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,660
save money on things like the large

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,300
office equipment utilities which allows

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,160
you to re-appropriate those cash to

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,400
other things like bringing everybody to

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,169
drupalcon or doing other fun things also

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,150
there's a very real thing about talent

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,680
so the nice thing about being a totally

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,360
virtual company is that we had a staff

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,979
member for example that moved from one

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,050
side of the country to the next and all

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,400
we lost was we had to adjust to the

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,070
timezone settings but other than that

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,170
everything was business as normal so we

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,730
don't lose talent to family changes we

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,260
can hire good people that maybe can't

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,020
move san Francisco's an incredibly

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,210
expensive city to come and live in so it

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,400
allows us to access great talent at a

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,830
reasonable price we also have more

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,620
flexibility as an agency and you can

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,350
scale you can hire more people there's a

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,840
bigger talent pool and I do find that

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,640
overall that one of the biggest benefits

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,310
for running a distributed companies your

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,870
team is happy and productive when people

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,150
get to work from home using their own

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,540
tools working at their own schedule they

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,670
tend to be very overall satisfied and of

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,320
course what is important is that really

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,790
the freedom of space and time and if

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,230
you're looking to kind of break free

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,120
from some of the constraints of an

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,330
office it's definitely going distributed

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,980
gives you some more freedom so today on

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,870
our slides we're going to talk a little

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,430
bit about some common myths and issues

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,080
throughout the course of the of the

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,880
presentation and these next two slides

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,140
are what we're going to cover so I

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,370
encourage you to think about other

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,140
things that you may be you know

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,940
concerned or worried about about going

00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,860
distributed or working from home some

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,360
challenges and if we don't cover them we

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,360
can talk about them in our Q&A period

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,540
okay so the first one there's some

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,990
common myths for example if i don't see

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,810
my employees they're not working another

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,580
one is higher remote employee is the

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,250
same as hiring in an office employee

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,460
again these are myths these are not the

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,830
truth people will know what it's what

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,230
it's like at the office they'll know but

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,790
really how will they and techno

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,950
ecology will solve all problems and it's

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,960
always better to meet face-to-face but

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,450
is it so remember these are myths that

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,590
people think that why they have a hard

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,840
time becoming a distributed company some

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,400
other common issues and when working and

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,480
building a distributed team are going

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,610
from virtual or going from

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,440
brick-and-mortar to virtual team is a

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:46,010
finding the right people and knowing

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,130
what to look for be communication issues

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,410
how to overcome those see isolation

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,770
isolations a very real thing when you

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,180
work from home d team bonding how do you

00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,470
facilitate team bonding through the

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,700
interwebs e burnout very very very real

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,320
and I don't think this matters if it's

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,690
in officer out office especially in

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,130
really heavy brain activities like

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,040
building Drupal sites Vernon it's a

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,170
really big thing and of course f which

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,790
is selling selling clients on what the

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,050
distributed model looks like so we're

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,830
going to cover all of these and go over

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:22,300
how you can actually tackle these as it

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:25,040
is a reality and you can make it work so

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,990
let's just first off talked about some

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,730
of the things to what you'll expect when

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,050
you are changing from a brick and mortar

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,400
or you're just starting your own agency

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,950
and you're planning to go totally

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,110
distributed one it is definitely more

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,910
work than co-located employees if

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,440
everybody is co-located it's much easier

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:45,860
to have the in between the lines be read

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,300
you have kind of this stuff that goes on

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,860
in the office that you missed so making

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,100
that actually a real thing in a

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,140
distributed company can be very tricky

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,090
there's also a learning curve one of my

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,500
favorite friend agencies is for kitchens

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,200
out of Austin and they recently have

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,060
gone from a brick and mortar office to

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,680
totally distribute it and I know one of

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,150
the challenges that they faced was that

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,710
if there was five people that were

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,230
distributed and ten that were in the

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,850
office instead of all huddling around in

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,740
a conference room everybody actually

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,930
took the call on video from their desk

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,880
even if they were sitting side by side

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,920
you have to be super ninja with mute

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,110
because you can hear everybody else's

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,000
voices but it's over coming in and

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,320
finding that learning curve and going

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,740
down that learning curve because it is a

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,110
real different environment and creating

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,790
a different sense of culture this

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,550
directly leads into that you may need to

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,260
switch the process and the culture if

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,209
you have a very in office team that's

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,830
maybe different they have different

00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,690
regiments and maybe there's a physical

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,250
stand up that everybody comes how can

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:47,330
you read how can you assimilate that

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,070
same type of vibe online and another big

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,140
thing is you're hiring processes may

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,180
need to change I highly recommend if

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,829
you're hiring a team member to do remote

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,660
work for you is use the tools that

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:59,120
you're going to use that you actually

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,890
work together so for example we like to

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,110
use zoom zoom is one of our wonderful

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,120
video communication tools so we actually

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,380
get everybody to interview on that with

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,820
their video on so they can get

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,820
comfortable with what that looks like

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,079
okay there's some pillars to success in

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,959
running a virtual agency and a lot of it

00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,430
comes down to organization

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,260
accountability figuring out ways for

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,790
personal interaction but first and

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,100
foremost which is the most important is

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,750
building trust and Trust is something

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,820
that people when they say oh if I don't

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,709
see them they're not working well that

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,540
just violates all of it you actually

00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:36,589
have to inherently trust the people that

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,510
you hire or don't hire them I love this

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:41,089
quote because I feel like this is so

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,709
true for remote teams there are no walls

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,510
there are no tribes there are no

00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:45,920
executives on the fifth floor there's no

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,950
one watching over your shoulder there's

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,779
no one babysitting it's simply

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:54,200
individuals bound by trust by one common

00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:56,480
goal so this comes back to the Y if you

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,270
help explain the why then we can all get

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,250
around the same common goal at canopy

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,380
studios freedom is one of our number one

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,420
values so when we come up two different

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,070
things we we question like does this

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,600
facilitate more freedom or does this

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,860
lock us down and of course it's not

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,140
black and white like that and that's a

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,520
very ethereal thing to look at when it

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,770
comes but it really is some of our

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,449
founding driving things so when people

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,660
come to canopy a lot of our team members

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:22,040
or writers or they're there they have

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,420
young families they want to be at home

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,620
and they want to have that flexibility

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,329
to make sure they can get to their

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,470
daughter's recital they want to make

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,579
sure that they can spend that quality

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,350
time instead of in a car so I think

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,850
Trust is such an important part of this

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,370
I really wanted to dive a little bit

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,779
more into trust now these two slides are

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,310
a little bit heavy and I was at this

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,019
really awesome conference called the

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,290
nonprofit and technology conference and

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:46,760
I went to this really cool session whoo

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,779
great great great awesome they have a

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,670
Drupal dated super cool

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,800
well but there was this woman who did a

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,480
presentation similar to this talk and

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,009
she had these great slides and these are

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,990
again are there a little text heavy so

00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,399
I'm going to post these but really

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,829
there's some certain things that create

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,620
and build trust and they're really

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,930
important to look at you know just

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,209
always assuming positive intent I think

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,860
that's absolutely super important when

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,589
you're working in a digital space things

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,259
text messages slack messages emails they

00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:17,120
cut really short sometimes so avoid any

00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:19,279
snippy emails and this one here is

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,170
really focused on positive contribution

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,730
like how do you contribute trust how do

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,050
you show up every day and contribute so

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,059
I'm not going to read them off you can

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:31,399
read them yourself but I will also post

00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:33,220
the slides I would say one thing that's

00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,300
that's been very encouraging for

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,430
building and communicating trust is

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,199
those group chats even though they can

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,540
get really noisy it's really important

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,220
to create areas for people to be able to

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,689
communicate as a group and we'll talk a

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,680
little bit more about communication

00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:53,029
tactics in a bit these are items that

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,579
don't build trust things uh really if

00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:57,649
for example if you see see everyone it

00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,970
really it's a weird thing but if you see

00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,259
see everybody it starts to be getting

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,759
noise and they don't know it's not very

00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,959
organized they don't know what to follow

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,430
snippy replies missing deadlines you

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,110
know all of these things and well it may

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,660
just be one thing or another they all

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:18,259
add up to from taking away from that

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:20,389
trust so let's talk about collaboration

00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,709
and how to work together because it's a

00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:25,370
different space when working on the

00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:28,639
internets first off let's talk about

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:33,559
some tactics first off rethink meetings

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:35,779
a meet shorter times shorter because

00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,540
when you are distributed it requires a

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,370
lot of constant communication but with

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,079
all the noise if you stack on a bunch of

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,779
meetings nobody actually has time to

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,490
think or do their work so perhaps so

00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,350
we've tried to do a canopy is we've

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,689
blocked off for developers we only meet

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,240
between a certain block of time between

00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:55,220
10am and 2pm guaranteeing there's an

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,720
hour for lunch so really we have

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,699
essentially at ten o'clock and eleven

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,170
o'clock and a1 o'clock and we have three

00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:01,400
hours to meet with team members if not

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,250
nothing

00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,770
because it helps block out time there's

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,510
also ways that we have meetings we have

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,910
a daily stand-up for all of the people

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:15,170
that are working on actively on projects

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,520
so that means no CEO no marketing no you

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,200
know it's just the project managers and

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,790
the developers and at 10am they do a

00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,430
daily stand-up and we walk through all

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,839
the projects there's also really

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,670
important you need to have team meetings

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,380
we have to once a month we have one

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,290
that's like hey it's friday we're going

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,670
to play virtual games and hang out and

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,110
then we have one halfway through the

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,300
month that's an all hands where we talk

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,520
about all the company things because

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,020
you're right they will not learn what is

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,120
going on in the company unless you

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,040
directly share and the only way to do

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,320
that is through collaboration so we have

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,970
a set time once a month that each of the

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,160
teams we have a tech ops team with

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,870
marketing we have development we have

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,550
build and support they all come together

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,870
and they present for seven minutes on

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,360
what they're doing in the company so

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,250
that helps create like oh cool you're

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,320
building that and then when we sit down

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,170
and do the friday where it's called we

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,540
have a mantra at work it's called

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,000
freedom fridays where we don't have

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,280
deadlines we never launched projects

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,940
neither should any of you but we have no

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,650
strong hard deliverables on a friday and

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,450
because we foster freedom its freedom

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,370
friday so if you actually don't want to

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,260
work on friday that's totally fine you

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,150
can maximize your schedule to work

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,770
10-hour days throughout you know monday

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,930
through thursday and take friday off i'm

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,860
ok with that it's totally cool we as a

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,870
company know that fridays are off limits

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,750
what that facilitates is the developers

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,760
that want heads down time for a full day

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,640
without interruption it can legitimately

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,140
turn off the world and focus and then

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,590
they doesn't bleed into their evenings

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,750
and weekends another thing is its

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,910
contribution it's no longer about what

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,580
you did today it's show me what you did

00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:55,550
today take me on a tour share and

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,020
explain that type of thing it's we try

00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,850
to be more engaging with screen shares

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,860
or with when we have fun things that

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,030
happen at work we have a little channel

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,200
where we can put cool things that

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,280
there's a site launch another question

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,870
that always comes up is how do you

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,190
manage time zones and how do you manage

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,930
that overlap and a lot of it is about

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,330
making it equally uncomfortable for all

00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,710
part

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,020
we've got East Coasters we've got west

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,910
coasters sometimes our west coasters are

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,070
up at six sometimes our east coasters

00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,870
are online at nine so we try to make it

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,970
equally uncomfortable we try to find

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,890
that time where we overlap and maximize

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,390
that but sometimes do the nature of

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,710
client business it doesn't always work

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,450
out like that so we try to make it

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,400
equally uncomfortable so it's not always

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,430
one team or the other off off their

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:44,480
schedule how many people in this room

00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:46,430
use slack yeah you do love that okay

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,250
cool so we're a big fan of slack as well

00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:51,260
and we tried to create that water cooler

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,360
setting in slack so we have a bunch of

00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,920
fun channels you can have notification

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,560
settings so each person when they get

00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,150
are boarded gets help with how to set

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,370
their notifications on slacks so they

00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,990
don't miss something important but they

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,060
can still participate when they want to

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,340
participate so for example we have a

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,840
music channel which is just all music

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,430
you can put your Spotify playlist in

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,110
there you can put your YouTube favorite

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,180
song you know it's Friday night

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,410
everybody you know people post stuff

00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,200
even on the weekends like here's my

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,210
Saturday work out tunes we have another

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,100
Fitness channel which is all the people

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,730
that are trying to get out of their

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,680
chairs and do certain things they've got

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,330
like a one of those Fitbit challenges in

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,310
there and everybody post pictures of the

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,930
morning run and this has all been stuff

00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,090
that the team is organically created as

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,500
that water cooler and having those like

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,270
organic channels that are not just

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,890
project based or function based they're

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,360
just kind of fun random stuff allows

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:47,720
people to kind of check in and out when

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:49,370
they have time also another big thing is

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,570
governance over documentation this is

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,430
something that we've struggled with

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,380
because it's hard to know what you don't

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,850
know but when we on board new people we

00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,710
look for where the gaps are and then try

00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,260
to create process and checklists and an

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,970
expectation management we even just

00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,590
created a communications charter to help

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,640
people understand how to write effective

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:09,620
emails because it's so much noise and of

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,910
course we want always seeing is

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,500
believing so if we can't have

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,660
opportunities like this at drupalcon

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,430
then we can actually see each other and

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,050
get to know each other and that creates

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,160
a deeper sense of connection which is

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,610
which is something that's really

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,680
important in a virtual team so I was

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,570
doing my research and I have to say I

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,039
added this in last minute because I just

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,909
thought this was so rad and so

00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,739
points so first off video so this is

00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,440
something that we advocate is that we

00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:38,149
prefer video but it's always optional we

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,590
always request that you knock you don't

00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:41,539
just be like hey I'm going to video chat

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,879
with you right now because a lot of us

00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:46,759
don't wear pants we work from home be

00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:48,080
it's very intrusive but you're right we

00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,309
can't just knock on the door and say hey

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,710
I just have to chat with you for a

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:54,289
minute this one goes into the next one

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,840
about you know reduce scheduling and

00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:58,249
that volleying back and forth like I

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,539
said you could usually go in an office

00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:00,799
and say hey can we just chat for a

00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,359
second you have a little chat we're

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,879
having a coffee well you don't really

00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,769
have that situation and remote team so

00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:08,479
if you feel like if you can't just

00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:11,359
schedule something pick up the phone and

00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:13,700
call and a lot of developers are usually

00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,109
shy about this because they want to just

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,149
have heads down time and I don't mean to

00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:18,229
pick on developers here because I know

00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:19,940
there's lots of people that don't like

00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:22,009
the phone but typically it's very

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,840
intrusive so a quick message hey can we

00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,369
chat for a second no I'm heads down but

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,320
we can chat in 15 we don't need to send

00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:29,149
a bunch of emails back and forth it gets

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,879
fairly formal sometimes and it doesn't

00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:33,739
need to be another one is I really like

00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:35,359
stop in line conversations if you have

00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,590
to like go down and put bulletins and

00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:44,629
stuff like that if it takes more than

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:46,669
just a short synopsis this one I really

00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,080
like to make your internet faster I

00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,639
think we've all been in those situations

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,739
where something's wrong with your

00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:54,889
connection you can't get your call to

00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:56,570
work you can't download your stuff I

00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:58,129
learned this ninja tick we're trick

00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,749
where you can actually download a VPN

00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:01,369
and then make it secure and then you can

00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:03,049
block out that noise when they find out

00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:04,909
where you are or trying to direct

00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,559
certain ads or whatnot so there's lots

00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:07,940
of tips and tricks but if you can find a

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,840
way to make your internet faster your

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:15,429
life will be better and the last one

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:19,070
which is one that I learned the hard way

00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:21,950
exercise so Herman Miller talks about

00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,409
this turtle position and how it's so

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,419
easy to slip into a bad position when

00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:28,429
you sit all day and also there's been a

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:31,309
much recently publicized talk about how

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:33,019
sitting is the new smoking will guess

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,849
what when you run a company and you

00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,259
weren't 14 hours a day and then you're

00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:37,369
building your patio but you're not

00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:39,139
carrying any bricks and you fall over

00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,489
guess what someone's got weak ankles

00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:41,840
because she hasn't been walking enough

00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:43,700
and broke her ankle

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,320
so exercise is something that I've had

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:51,590
to learn as a remote worker that I have

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:53,000
to schedule in okay so talent talent is

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,350
a question on everybody's mind and

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,679
especially in Drupal because it seems to

00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:00,980
be in a bit of a shortage so you say so

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,929
talented people really can work they can

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,990
choose what they want to do and who they

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:09,230
want to work with remote workers tend to

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,120
be inherently self-motivated there they

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,620
have a passion for creating outstanding

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,809
work and those are the type of people

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,630
that will really strive and do well in a

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,010
remote situation it's very tricky to

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,200
bring on a person who has never worked

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,000
remote before if you were bringing on

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,010
someone to work remote before you have

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,500
to remember is going to take a lot more

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,990
training in time so during your

00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,270
interview process ask questions about

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,190
you know what do you usually do on your

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,649
lunch break how do you spend your free

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,210
time how do you get you know like what

00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:40,100
do you think is your top three tips from

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,039
working from home and you would be

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,720
surprised what people say and my number

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,210
one tip is get up and get showered and

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,010
get ready because it's really awkward at

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,659
2pm when the postman comes and you're

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:57,070
like your messy bun your sweatpants and

00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:59,510
you're like hey I have a job really so

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,799
remote rock stars again we kind of

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,230
talked a little bit about this but they

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,899
contribute trust every day every day

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,659
they show up and contribute trust they

00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:11,120
keep things moving they instantly

00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,980
instantly like contribute they don't

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,380
even just say like hi how's it going

00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,370
they really over communicate remember

00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,110
when you had like your first boyfriend

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,090
your first girlfriend and you like fell

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,559
asleep with the phone and you know you

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,789
never wanted to like let them go well

00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:24,980
it's kind of like that at least with a

00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:25,970
nine-to-five of when you're online is

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,010
that you really want to let your

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,990
co-workers know where you are when you

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,419
step away from your desk if you're not

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,669
going to meet a deadline if you have

00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:36,169
free time and can help that people know

00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:37,700
if you've learned about some cool new

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:39,860
awesome framework or something cool

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,140
about d8 or something share those things

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,080
when you see someone's committing bad

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:47,270
code when you see someone you know

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,799
falling behind because we can't I'll see

00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,240
each other if you see something it's

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,919
important to surface it and if you've

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,809
created a culture of acceptance and

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,610
openness that allows those conversations

00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:57,140
to happen it's okay

00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,640
I tell everybody in the company it's

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,100
totally okay if you screw up and I

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,570
expect you to screw up a ton but if

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,520
you're not learning from it then we have

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,170
an issue that's when we have troubles if

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,580
we're repeating the same and mistake now

00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:12,470
we've got some troubles but most people

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:14,420
they learn from all their mistakes so

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,799
remote is really not for everyone and if

00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,540
you are thinking about remote you have

00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,309
to really think about some of the main

00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:23,360
things is that you may miss being around

00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:26,000
people I find what's really important to

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,820
scheduling evening activities go and

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,500
play kickball go outside go and figure

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,840
out how to have a Wednesday night book

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,309
club at the library or you know connect

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,220
with a community of people outside your

00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:38,780
home you may have you may miss like

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,150
playing ping-pong or going up for

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,030
lunches so if you if you want to create

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,460
that there is a whole bunch of like

00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:47,690
lunchtime running clubs or you know

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,220
there's different things that you can do

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,490
I know that some of our team members

00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,169
they play what is that league of legends

00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,090
I think they all play that and so

00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:58,040
they're like lunch break yeah they're

00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,600
all like you know I'm like okay we also

00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,220
try to coordinate lunch breaks for the

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,990
team the West Coasters we all try to

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,250
take it at noon so we're all offline at

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,410
the same time and then we're all online

00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:09,320
at the same time doesn't always work but

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,910
we try and a very natural thing that

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,340
will happen is you may lose the

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,049
distinction between your life and your

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,220
work so we'll talk a little bit about

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:19,220
how to overcome some of those challenges

00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,840
in a second but I do think that some

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,460
some of the challenges are definitely

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,000
some time zones and that comes to

00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,320
figuring out how to overlap

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,480
prioritization it's hard to know what to

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,669
do next sometimes and when we don't have

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,169
a constant place to check in that's why

00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,970
we have our daily scrums because

00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:36,260
honestly things move so fast that the

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,130
clients like no don't actually do that

00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,750
or I need this by Friday now Monday so

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,790
and have a criteria for what

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,450
prioritization looks like and help your

00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:49,100
team members prioritize another thing

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,830
that's a really hard thing to do is

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,200
measuring engagement this is where as as

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,179
the CEO and I'm always concerned and I'm

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,410
always wanting to foster this culture of

00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:59,390
awesomeness and ensuring people

00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,090
contribute Dave's a really funny guy

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:04,610
Dave's always laughing Dave's always

00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:08,029
putting funny jokes in even in the most

00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,739
stressful times dave is light-hearted up

00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:11,299
need all of a sudden Dave's not so

00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:14,539
chatty anymore all of a sudden Dave's

00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:15,919
not posting videos anymore so we gotta

00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:17,509
call Dave we got to find out what's

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,070
going on with Dave because it could be a

00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:21,499
work thing it could be a personal thing

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,029
but we had to measure engagement but if

00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,219
everybody knows that we're kind of all

00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:27,559
looking out for each other and saying Oh

00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:29,629
Dave's been really quiet on slack lately

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,489
then we can ninja call him and say hey

00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:33,409
Dave how you doin how's everything going

00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:34,700
you know and he may or may not open you

00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:36,019
may tell you who may not it may just

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,759
he's been heads down with his earphones

00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:39,619
on actually just cranking out code and

00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,359
needs some heads down time totally cool

00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,499
now I know but it's really hard to

00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,289
measure that without that I the eye

00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:47,979
contact that's also why we encourage

00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:50,239
video because video is something that

00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:52,219
doesn't only allow us to see each other

00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:54,649
we see ourselves when we see ourselves

00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:55,879
we go oh I'm eyes look really ten so you

00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,649
know you can really read a lot of body

00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:59,570
language so the more video that you can

00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,190
do the better and let's zoom it's so

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,789
affordable and so easy to use because

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:08,359
honestly skype sucks so it's a swear

00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:10,129
word in our company alright so another

00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,149
one here that's very challenging here is

00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,469
if you're looking at running a

00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,999
distributed shop and you're looking at

00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:15,409
hiring people out of country or out of

00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:17,269
state you have to be mindful of your

00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:19,580
taxes and how you're going to manage

00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,399
your health care so I highly recommend

00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,830
zenpayroll or with a gusto now and Zen

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,749
Offit's and they help with our Florida

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,219
because unemployment tax is very

00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:30,259
different in Florida than it is in

00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:32,059
Nevada than it is in California so

00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:34,339
managing multiple states and multiple

00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:36,440
taxes can get very complex so either

00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,539
find a good accountant or we use gusto

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,070
and Zen benefits which we love is our

00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:42,309
online tool to help manage all those

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44,149
things and they help submit like

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:47,719
whatever we need to submit on a

00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:51,379
quarterly basis and all the paperwork ok

00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:53,239
so we're big fans one of our things is

00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:55,190
we wanted to create this culture of

00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:56,749
Awesomeness awesome people show up do

00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,249
awesome work with awesome clients we

00:29:56,749 --> 00:30:01,639
build awesome projects that sounds so

00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:03,259
California as me but it is super rad and

00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:04,909
to do that these are some of the things

00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,429
that we created at canopy studios

00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:09,859
personally to facilitate that culture of

00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:12,789
Awesomeness one it was actually creating

00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:15,889
you know establishing goals and dreams

00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:17,659
everybody has their why and it's really

00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:19,099
important to stay close to that why so

00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:20,550
when we get into the weeds we could go

00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,720
oh right I'm doing this because I

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,190
they want to build treehouses and I

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,050
really really really hate keyway right

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,460
now but one day you know and I don't

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,960
want to put it out there as a golden

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,540
carrot but there's things we're all

00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,580
working to and so once a year usually

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,290
around new years we all set resolutions

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,390
and there are more like goals and dreams

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,940
we set them for professional personal

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,380
goals and then we set them for what we

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,600
would like to see in the company and

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,520
then we publicize them on our internal

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,860
Trello board so we can all see them and

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,300
then we can all help each other so when

00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,070
you know Ricky says I really want to

00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,180
make a great support process and beaker

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,350
goes oh yeah I'm going to build this

00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,510
virtual machine and I'm gonna do this

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,130
awesomeness and I'm like oh cool because

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,620
he knows that his work can support

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,470
Ricky's professional goals and dreams so

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,670
we check out on that twice a year

00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,140
another thing is this process and this

00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,330
is something again we've challenged

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,030
we've had both success and challenges

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,220
but documenting the process to which you

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,840
do things documenting your onboarding

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,850
process documenting your pre-launch

00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,830
checklist documenting your SEO checklist

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,720
like having all these things ready

00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,190
because it's some of that like oh did

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,720
you get that that you don't get that

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,670
when your virtual everything's very

00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,240
direct you don't have that in office

00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,830
like oh don't forget about that another

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,260
way we do is when we're bringing on a

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:34,260
new staff is that we pair them up with

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,730
another person and that person is like

00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,560
their Sherpa for the first three months

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,180
they work at the organization and they

00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,400
help them with how to do better time

00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,890
she's how to do you know where do you

00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,690
put in time for requesting time off we

00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,010
have an employee handbook but like they

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,990
read it once and they don't ever maybe

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,480
look at it again but they know they can

00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,310
ask a trusted friend in the company to

00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,370
help them integrate it into the process

00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,140
in the systems we also have like a

00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,690
really small WordPress department and

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,820
they feel very isolated and our rails

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,410
department is even smaller and they

00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,760
really feel isolated and they don't want

00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,260
to come to Deb scrum they're all talking

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,800
about Drupal and they don't care about

00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,530
that stuff so we actually create an

00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,060
opportunity to pair those people

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,490
inter-department and collaborate on

00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,740
other projects whether even it's a blog

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:22,080
post or whether it's you know planning

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,520
the next team game and we'll do like

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,840
little micro assignments that helps

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,500
blend the different people because

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,000
ultimately I got feedback from some of

00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,040
my team members that they're like I just

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,290
don't know really what baqir does I'm

00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,420
like oh well

00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,800
you on deaf scrum every day yeah but I

00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,510
don't really know what I was like oh we

00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,100
need to create more avenues for people

00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,330
to kind of cross contaminate in

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,890
different ways we also I think a lot of

00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,800
people that have a lot of good talent

00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:51,330
strive for excellent or perfection and

00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,340
we really say let's all strive for

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,690
excellence not perfection and that's a

00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,580
really big motto is that we just try to

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,710
do our best but to know that it's okay

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,060
if we screw up or things don't go the

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:03,330
way we thought we're going to learn from

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,070
it and then of course if culture

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,020
cultures are really big important part

00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,640
of what you do so for us having that

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,870
sense of freedom is really important so

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,630
whatever you can do to create your own

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:17,310
freedom Fridays ok so communicate and

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,840
communicate more this is again it came

00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,340
from this woman slides that I really

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,930
enjoyed so I wanted to include them in

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,510
my presentation so they come up

00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:28,710
afterwards but these are the pros and

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,570
cons between emails phone and chat so

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,490
it's really when you want to take a

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,200
thinking think for a second when you're

00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,440
trying to communicate something what's

00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,730
the best format to use it so emails that

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,740
you know it's you get time to think

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,620
about it you can create that paper trail

00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,830
you're not limited by time zones the

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:49,020
cons you can lose context some people

00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:51,900
find email overwhelming there's no tone

00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:54,150
there's no facial expressions phone

00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,520
works really well to clarify its

00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,260
immediate you know it facilitates

00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,080
natural conversations about the daily

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,550
life but it's sometimes you know it's

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,990
uncomfortable for some people they don't

00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,550
want to just be ninja call did I go the

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,790
phone's ringing that's very jarring cuz

00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,990
we're you know we may talk hang out on

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:13,380
our phones but we might not use them to

00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:15,870
talk all the time and then chat Chad's

00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,880
wonderful it's quick it's short you know

00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,610
it's a doorbell to check activity or

00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,200
availability it's portable but it also

00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,880
is very interruptive so when you're

00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,960
thinking about this you know you want to

00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,310
kind of think about the different

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,080
avenues and I just put this in here

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,490
because everybody asks which I think

00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,890
everybody knows now but what are some of

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,540
the tools that you could use and I think

00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,250
there's four main sections of tools that

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,870
you can use and again I'm or post these

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,090
here so you can go ahead and look these

00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,550
up after what I've encouraged is that

00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,100
pic a tool and stick to it it's very

00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,970
confusing for someone who knows that oh

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,320
we're going to zoo

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,000
and then someone's like hey here's this

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,460
hangout link oh can you meet me on skype

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,020
oh maybe you know so pick something

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,580
that's commune you know and we like zoom

00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,230
because it's kind of like phone and it's

00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,090
video and it's screen sharing it's all

00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:06,240
in one and then we like to use slack

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:07,530
okay a big part of this is well we all

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,970
want to live the dream and work remote

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,950
FaceTime is probably one of the most

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,820
special times that we get together and

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:16,470
if you can have this facetime both even

00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,900
virtually like I keep saying this video

00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,550
is so important but even people that are

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,490
in the same city we have a group of

00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,680
people that are in Victoria British

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,790
Columbia so once a month they go out and

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,010
they just hang out and have a cup of

00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:32,940
coffee or maybe go for five or ten beers

00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:34,470
and have a really good time there's an

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,930
instigator in Victoria who's all about

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,700
the beers but you know the thing is is

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,650
that they create this like micro culture

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,440
and then they come back jaws and excited

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,540
and we also have regional slack channels

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,430
so the likes all the Vancouver people

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,740
that are in Vancouver's we've got ten

00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,720
people in Vancouver so they can just say

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,520
hey did you hear about this thing that's

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,690
happening specific to their region so it

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,280
doesn't flood the whole communication

00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,910
channel but they feel connected as a

00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,270
micro community use events all of those

00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,950
things to build and honestly you can try

00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,230
even a co-working space it's a great

00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,630
place to like get out there and just be

00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,160
outside of your house so that leads us

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:15,750
into some of the lifework boundary

00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,849
issues that definitely happen so these

00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:21,230
are some tips and tricks a create a

00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:24,510
specific office space where you work and

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,060
build that routine as well as what your

00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,830
routine is for a change of scenery find

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,050
a coffee shop that has great Wi-Fi

00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,910
that's not too far away make sure that

00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,650
your data plan is enabled for tethering

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,089
so if you do want to work with the

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,349
fishing pole in the water and you know

00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,910
their cell phone reception there and

00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:40,980
that's actually feasible on Fridays or

00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,000
something then go ahead and do that but

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,619
make sure that you're well prepared

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,369
because if you don't have internet your

00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:49,260
life sucks it's awful also try different

00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:51,000
computing devices some of our team

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,980
members they use like an iPad to

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,660
actually join on video so they're not

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,220
distracted by anything else and then

00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,240
they'll just communicate through that so

00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,380
you can choose different devices

00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,940
distractions are totally under

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,500
roll if you're working from home it's

00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,030
just a matter of having the discipline

00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,470
and this is where it comes if somebody's

00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,750
already work promote and distributed

00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,400
before it's a lot easier they know that

00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,470
they can't just turn on their favorites

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,270
open at lunch and have lunch and then

00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,710
just sit there for the afternoon right

00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,350
that railroads our day they're working

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,840
in the night it's not good so you do

00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,430
have distractions under your control we

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,460
do find that one of the most effective

00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:30,030
ways because we all work too much is we

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,590
block time and block time for lunch is

00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,300
one of the most important things when

00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,310
you work from home with a multi timezone

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,010
company is if you don't block for lunch

00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,240
and you don't eat lunch three o'clock is

00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,230
not only going to feel sleepy it's going

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,580
to feel awful so make sure you eat

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,430
another thing is really important to

00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:50,040
block time to do personal things so for

00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:52,230
example Vanessa she loves she goes the

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,760
gym every day or tuesdays and thursdays

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,250
at four thirty it's in her calendar

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,450
nobody books over it they know it and

00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,230
then she has that freedom and

00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:05,400
flexibility to do the things she wants

00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:07,950
and blog time to call your grandma she

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,970
needs calls so call her or your grandpa

00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,710
or your mom three kids so and also give

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,000
yourself the benefit of downtime if you

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,770
want to work remote and build a remote

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,720
company then take advantage of it you

00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,250
know it's something that you don't need

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,000
to work 12 hours a day it's not

00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:26,010
functional so also be where are the

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,350
Dragons you will get cabin fever your

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,270
team members will get cabin fever

00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,790
encourage them to turn it off you have a

00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,020
time where they check in and check out

00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:37,290
make sure you're well set up at home

00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:40,680
with the proper tools and of course the

00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:42,480
fridge is very accessible so I would

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,770
recommend cutting up healthy snacks to

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,180
leave in the fridge because you will

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,160
wander oh I really don't want to write

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,260
that code oh yeah oh look at that so

00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,770
prepare yourself for healthy with

00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,780
healthy snacks when you're dealing with

00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,730
burnout it's really important to force

00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,310
vacation for your team members and it's

00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,110
absolutely important that if you see

00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,550
them online at late night you poke up

00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,170
and you say are you okay are you good

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,060
you want to be like what's going on and

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,830
make sure that they have good life work

00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,070
boundaries because if they burn out you

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,110
lose them and that's not good another

00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,120
thing that's really important is is when

00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,940
you talk talk about setting priorities

00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,950
can't make everything ASAP and it's so

00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,120
tempting just to send a slap chat every

00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,620
time that you have a question as a

00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,510
project manager but that's where if you

00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:26,250
can batch some of your conversations and

00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,470
your questions we do that that's why the

00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,840
morning scrum is there so the PM's can

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,250
all attack all the devs all at once okay

00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,420
do you have this answer d an estimate i

00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,980
need this out i need this out finding

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,650
this out but then they know they have to

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,150
leave them alone after 2pm and they have

00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,610
to save their questions unless it's an

00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,260
emergency and then put that to the next

00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,630
day because almost everything can wait

00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,160
12 hours and if it can't then that's the

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,720
exception and that as long as the

00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,700
exception doesn't become the norm then

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,700
you have that flexibility to reach out

00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:05,820
okay there we go so so this again goes

00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,470
that if you're choosing a distributed

00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,390
team you're choosing it because people

00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,860
want to have some lifestyle flexibility

00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,570
you really need to be able to strike

00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,600
when the iron's hot I'm really

00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,910
productive from 5am till 11am and then

00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,550
I'm kind of motion till about three like

00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,590
I don't know what happens between 11 and

00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,420
3 every day but then from three to seven

00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:26,640
I'm really productive so I really

00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,920
maximize that time so that's what we

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,480
work on now as long as you guys as long

00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,010
as your team members are on time and on

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,870
budget and they're contributing trust

00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,400
every day and if they really really

00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,780
really you know we have a couple of

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,760
people that have small kids they work

00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,470
from you know seven to nine they do the

00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,360
kid routine they're back from like ten

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,440
o'clock until two and then they do the

00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,330
kid routine and then they're back

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,830
they're choosing to jar their day like

00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,540
that and if they can manage it all the

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,310
power to them when they start missing

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:55,320
timeline deadlines and stuff then it

00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:58,100
becomes a problem but you can do it okay

00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,270
gel so a couple more things here is that

00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,560
client services and running a

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,630
distributed company is something that I

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,460
come across all the time whoa you know

00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,600
you're not in our office how do you how

00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,220
do you see all your staff how do you

00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,140
know they're working on our stuff but

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,430
you can often you know when you're

00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,140
presenting your company as a digital

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,840
agency you have to learn how to sell it

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,480
differently the first one is is let them

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,780
know up front right away be transparent

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,460
be honest and also if you since you

00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,040
can't meet them face-to-face be like

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,440
uber responsive when it comes to

00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,630
returning phone calls emails in

00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,310
sent messages the more responsive you

00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,079
are the better that you build trust with

00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:37,380
your clients to know that you are always

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,579
online also you want to share when

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,690
you're working just because you work

00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,099
from home doesn't mean you work

00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,480
Saturdays so if your client starts

00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,069
thinking oh she's working from home I'm

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,810
going to message her on Saturdays don't

00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:47,640
reply till Monday or reply said great

00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,930
I'll talk to you on Monday you know set

00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,520
those expectations to create your own

00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:55,200
work-life balance and you can also you

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,760
know set up a space to show the work in

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,200
progress I find a lot of these clients

00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,550
that are worried about having working

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,780
with a distributed team it's mostly

00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,760
because they've been burned somewhere

00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,119
else so if you can help them like

00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,490
contribute trust in your ways then it

00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,140
all works out and that's educating the

00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,579
client letting them know that you get to

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,950
hire some of the best talent because

00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,480
you're not just local that time zone

00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:18,300
challenges are gone we can service the

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,910
whole country and we often come to you

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,740
so I will fly my whole team that are all

00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,150
over the country into San Francisco for

00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,190
a meeting not only do we get that face

00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,250
time we get extended client time and

00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,710
that really creates more more of that

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,210
awesomeness and his lower overhead means

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:40,819
that you can focus more on the client

00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,819
okay so here we are at some Q&A yes

00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,270
right so are you looking for company

00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,070
that's fully distributed yeah so there's

00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:02,080
a couple of folks that are totally

00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:07,450
distributed there is a conference called

00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:10,930
Yammer which is not Yammer no yes yonder

00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,890
yonder so thank you so yonder if you go

00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,900
and you look at all the people that

00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:16,060
participate in that that one is a great

00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,380
resource to look at ninja companies also

00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,750
there's a job site called we've work

00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,630
remotely calm and that often has only

00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,160
remote jobs posted and then on

00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:27,010
drupal.org you know you can check off

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,080
that like telecommute exception and then

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,670
you kind of look around we actually

00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,530
hired someone from drupalcon last year

00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,580
because he found an old presentation of

00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,320
mine that was about running a

00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,460
distributed shop and he was like I want

00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,860
to work with you guys because you're

00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,420
distributed that was his main thing he

00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,910
could you know the rest was secondary

00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,190
but distributed was number one so just

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:48,240
stay steadfast you'll find one we're

00:43:45,190 --> 00:44:00,340
hiring by the way that's right I Clyde

00:43:48,240 --> 00:44:02,950
yeah just a friend yes we do contract to

00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,109
hire so we have some permal answers

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,060
because they prefer that methodology of

00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:11,410
payment but generally we find that full

00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:14,320
timers are down for the cause so yes we

00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:17,880
are mostly full timers contractors is

00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,880
totally optional though so

00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:26,320
okay I'll repeat the question for sure

00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:45,380
so financials for like is this more of a

00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:48,440
profitable business model is that what

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,670
you're asking I don't know cuz I take

00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,870
all the money and put it right back in

00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:55,730
the company so I think that we can

00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,770
distribute funds differently so instead

00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,360
of paying the foreground for an office

00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,910
every month I could take that foreground

00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,280
and send like micro bonuses to people or

00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:06,860
I can take them on trips or we can go on

00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,350
different things so I would assume that

00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,240
yes overall it is more financially

00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:13,910
profitable because you're able to have

00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,580
different the reality is is someone who

00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,860
lives in San Francisco needs a lot more

00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:21,170
of dollars per hour than somebody who

00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,730
doesn't so there is some financial

00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:28,270
benefits to running this company this

00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,270
way for sure yeah that answered that

00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:50,720
yes that is a challenge that I've

00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,090
consciously chosen to hire only North

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,070
American talent and then we have this

00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:59,720
wonderful guy named baqir show up and he

00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:02,330
lives in Turkey so turkey is we always

00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:07,220
ask if he's okay every day but he is so

00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:09,200
but he he conforms to our timezones a

00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,570
little bit and we know that we can note

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,390
we do not message him after 2pm because

00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:17,240
that's his midnight so we try to create

00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:20,990
flex like an actual blocked schedule for

00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:24,230
our one gentleman that's in Turkey but

00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:25,940
generally it's I know that's tricky and

00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:28,130
I feel like some of our clients that are

00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,290
in the UK we have that challenge and

00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,200
really what we try to do is make it

00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:34,700
equally uncomfortable so if you can know

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,500
what your daily task is the day before

00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,350
and you can have clear direction and go

00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,240
ahead then sweet if you need to engage

00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,680
with different people then there is

00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,690
going to be maybe once a week your

00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,670
project manager has to get up at 6am or

00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,440
4am to talk to you effectively so you're

00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,510
still in your clear mental headspace and

00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,920
you're not talking to them @midnight so

00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,860
I think it's about making it equally

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,570
uncomfortable and I know that global

00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:59,630
companies have a lot of this the similar

00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:02,650
challenge so I think there was a

00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,650
question in the back here

00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:30,730
okay okay so she's asking about some

00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,650
hiring tips and tricks and if there's

00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,420
some hiring best practices there was a

00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:39,770
situation where they hired someone and

00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:42,980
then he stopped contracted his work so I

00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:44,630
would think that you want to help lay

00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:47,060
out the expectations of what the job

00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:49,610
looks like and we ask that everybody

00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,440
contributes code every day or contribute

00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,240
something if maybe a designer they

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,520
contribute an update or they contribute

00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,900
something and we do code review so if

00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,340
somebody was subcontracting their work

00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,150
they would have to be really sneaky to

00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:04,970
get it through it's it's it's a very

00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,580
tricky thing we have a hiring process

00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:09,200
where we actually do let's say we're

00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,750
hiring a developer they send in their

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,250
resume they send in code samples we take

00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,170
a look at their code samples we look at

00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,850
the writing skills in that time we're

00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,170
judging them on their responsiveness on

00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,060
their professionalism and their

00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:22,580
organizational skills all of that is

00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,980
like the soft skills we're analyzing

00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,720
them on if they pass code review then

00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,850
they go into a soft skills and we have a

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,040
list of questions we ask that are

00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:33,410
specific to the role which includes

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,080
things like what are your top three tips

00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,610
for working remote and if and if they

00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,460
don't say you know if they don't even

00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,960
think about it's not even it depends on

00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,160
the answer but if we have some things

00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,080
that we know we can start weeding out

00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,000
candidates and then they kind of go

00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,370
through that and then we give them okay

00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,470
this sounds really harsh I will take a

00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:53,330
long time to hire you but I will fire

00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:56,600
you very quickly you have two weeks to

00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:58,730
deliver two weeks not three months two

00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,820
weeks if you can show up in two weeks

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:04,790
and kick some serious bootay we're good

00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,820
and that also means if you go dark once

00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:10,010
in those two weeks without notification

00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,510
immediate dismissal because it's

00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:13,820
absolutely important that everybody

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,680
stays online when they're online totally

00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,930
fair all of a sudden dogs gone and you

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,520
got to run outside I'm going to run the

00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:21,200
dogs outside I got to go and I'm there

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,910
off the day they told me we can manage

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,160
that it's when they don't communicate so

00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,720
having some expectations that when

00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,370
people come into the job they know what

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,740
to expect and they know how to interact

00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:35,710
with you and then give a metrics of

00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,710
whether they pass and fail yes

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,210
how to land business I think that's a

00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,500
whole session on itself and it says I

00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,360
always say focus on your strengths and

00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:58,440
sales is mine is my passion i love that

00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:00,360
i would definitely say networking has

00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,490
been the most lucrative form of business

00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,990
development getting to know if you're in

00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,310
your local community go and meet your

00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:10,190
marketing agencies in town that

00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:10,190
subcontract work it's a big question I

00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:16,680
wish no I spent a lot of my time doing

00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,330
HR operations and then strategic

00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,190
business development but I hired a sales

00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:26,090
person so I'm slowly getting out of my

00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:26,090
own way hopefully yeah in the back

00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:44,270
so we have a technology plan that if

00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,230
they we will most people come with their

00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,000
own hardware and they're most

00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,040
comfortable with their own hardware but

00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,720
if not we will pay for half of the

00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,760
laptop if they want to keep it if they

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,050
don't want to keep it then we'll pay for

00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,060
the whole thing but they have to return

00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,280
it now most people want to keep it and

00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,960
most people either have a computer or

00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,180
not so it actually comes up not too

00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,890
often but we do have like cell phone

00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,420
plans we cover people's cell phone plans

00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,500
now they we usually put their phone on

00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,120
ours because they don't want to carry

00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,960
around two phones but we need them to be

00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:14,270
connected when we work on more highly

00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,250
secure projects will actually provide

00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,540
the laptops and all of the secure

00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,520
connections you have a security expert

00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,290
that prepares all of those but those are

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,060
for specific use cases because most

00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:27,650
people want to be able to have their own

00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:30,580
tools I'm going to switch show over here

00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,580
this is a new question

00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,930
okay so the question is how to deal with

00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,610
mentorship in a remote situation this

00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,260
gentleman's brick and mortar and that's

00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,380
part of their onboarding process is

00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:12,110
bringing those juniors and we find that

00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,250
having an onboarding checklist so you

00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:17,090
know that they have to do certain things

00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:18,740
we also put them on tasks that are maybe

00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,660
we'll have internal tasks like for

00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,150
example we work with bad camp and we

00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,160
help run so they can maybe do QA we give

00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:27,170
them tasks that are low level and we do

00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,940
pairing the most important time the most

00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:30,620
important thing about that is actually

00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,500
carving out space from the seniors to

00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,730
help the juniors because that to us is

00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,620
that we actually because they're

00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,420
railroaded with all the virtual stuff

00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,490
like you don't even know how much they

00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,620
get railroaded with so we really have to

00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:45,470
clear their schedules and create a

00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:47,090
process now we struggle with this we

00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:49,580
struggle with this because it's mostly

00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:52,930
that we need to spend more time creating

00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:56,630
process around how to onboard or mentor

00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:59,000
more junior people and a lot of it's the

00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,590
buddy system right having someone that

00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,080
you pair with that person and that they

00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:05,540
they almost like shadow that person

00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,180
through projects and so many projects as

00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,190
you know or different from project to

00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,350
project that if you have a standard

00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,060
process what is your tech stack one of

00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,190
the tools that you need to install how

00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,470
do we how do we write our code you know

00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,210
having those documents I believe and I

00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:22,280
probably would even turn to you for some

00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,720
advice on that on how do you do your in

00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,300
office stuff because I have a feeling

00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,980
the big thing is is that if you can be

00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,870
on a device where you're on a video so

00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,550
if an ipad you've got your video open on

00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,840
both both of those devices but you're

00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,700
still then coding on the computer

00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,860
together then you can maybe pair program

00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,300
some way or you can collaborate in a way

00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,040
just by using another device so you

00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,720
still have the human because you need to

00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,040
see them right you need to kind of see

00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,840
them when you see their brow furrow and

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,460
they go yeah I understand you're like

00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,590
you don't understand at all okay stop

00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,450
wait a second right you can't see that

00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,250
over the phone so that video part is

00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:59,590
like the closest we can get to kind of

00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:59,590
putting people together yeah yeah

00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,140
so the big thing is that if they don't

00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,790
contribute trust within the first two

00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,470
weeks they won't contribute trust ever

00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:31,170
so I'm looking for them to contribute

00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,060
trust so if they show up every day and

00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,310
say I don't know what's going on but I'm

00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,720
really excited to be here and what do I

00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,760
need to read and where's my next thing

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,770
that gets me really engaged when they

00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,420
haven't done anything in three days and

00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:44,550
nobody can get ahold of them or whatever

00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,980
then I get then we get worried so it's

00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:48,750
like we like to fight higher slow and

00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,849
fire fast but we're hoping that the

00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,230
hiring process is really thorough so

00:54:50,849 --> 00:55:02,819
that we very rarely get into those

00:54:52,230 --> 00:55:06,359
positions yeah question over here sure

00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:10,020
no yeah so my mom got sick and I

00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:11,849
couldn't work so I started thinking that

00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:14,190
oh I'm just going to take a project

00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:15,900
management contract job and what

00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,640
happened was I reached out to my team

00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,710
that I'd worked with in the career in

00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,200
the past which is a group of small

00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:24,060
contractors and there about four guys

00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,069
four guys and one girl that worked in I

00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:29,880
said I'm looking for some type of gig

00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:32,010
and they magically through somehow had a

00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,530
project that was fairly large and a

00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:36,420
needed project management help and then

00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,160
they said well if you find us more work

00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,200
then we'll give you a commission on it

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,680
and I literally lived at my mom's house

00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,450
and ate half a burrito a day and

00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,010
bootstrapped it because I had been in

00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,420
positions in the past where I took on

00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,010
business loans and personally I didn't

00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,099
want to do that again I'd rather like

00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:55,200
eat ramen for a year so and i hoarded

00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:57,210
cash i hoarded cash for the first year I

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,579
put everything I possibly could away I

00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:01,500
was really frugal I flight economy with

00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:03,150
no upgrades ever ever ever you know

00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,579
never ordering cocktails on the plane

00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:08,220
ever you know because I really it was a

00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:11,250
personal choice on lifestyle to gain

00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,690
more freedom over the long term but cash

00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:22,530
flow is king

00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:24,780
so yeah yeah so we try to make sure that

00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,609
we have a fair salary for wherever you

00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,230
are based on your cost of living like if

00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:29,609
you don't have state tax you don't have

00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,050
we don't to pay you that much to cover

00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:33,599
your state tax but we want to make sure

00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:35,130
that it's equitable and most importantly

00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,690
we find with salary is that there's a

00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,089
path for advancement based on

00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:41,130
performance so we do like a three month

00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:42,839
how you doin are you going to come full

00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:44,250
time yes and then we do a six month

00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,869
review and then they go annually and

00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,369
then they're based on performance but

00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,720
it's a collaborative process where they

00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:50,280
say these are my goals this is my

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,520
challenges these are my opportunity

00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,380
areas it definitely varies from country

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,900
to country about half of our staff are

00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,730
in Canada and to accommodate those full

00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,410
timers I have to have a Canadian company

00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:09,050
because I can't employ them through my

00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:13,980
US company it's very complicated yeah no

00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:16,920
no no I don't video yes video yes one

00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,960
hundred percent video and I try to fly

00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,550
as the business owners I try to fly to

00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,290
them within the first year of their

00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:25,020
employment but that's not always

00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:27,030
possible so I definitely I when I first

00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,849
met Paul I was like dude you're so tall

00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:32,810
no clue how tall someone is on a video

00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:37,440
chat we're all floating heads right so

00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:38,970
yeah it's definitely it's a very

00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,980
expensive process to go and fly

00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,750
everywhere to meet every candidate and

00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,160
we figure after the first three months

00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,780
if that's going to be solid then we'll

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,970
probably fly them to a client meeting

00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,440
most often way that people need is we

00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,540
have a kickoff meeting and we'll fly all

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,250
those team members to that location have

00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,359
that kickoff meeting and that might be

00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,490
in portland that might be in New York

00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:57,720
might be in San Francisco and they get

00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:59,700
really jazz because they're going to a

00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,410
new city that works going to pay for and

00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,030
they get to meet their co-workers and

00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:04,640
then I try to moderate their liquor

00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:07,170
consumption but it's very challenging

00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:13,680
they get very excited when they see each

00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:18,829
other so oh sorry guys yeah no worries

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,829
