Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Once Upon a Drop Cap
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	What we have to say has always been intimately intertwined with how we say it. Design is about communicating those ideas and influencing users’ behavior, so it follows that influence is imparted largely by how we design. For all our intellectual complexity, our brains are still wired to make near-instant judgements about the value and importance of the message we are receiving based on how that message appears.

Thankfully, most of us are still familiar enough with actual books to remember the feel of paper under our fingers, the smell of the ink, the elegant transitions from one idea to the next – all in service of the story. While pixels remain odorless, there’s much more we can do than just deliver a digital message. Practiced typography transforms that message into a compelling experience. Let’s take a journey forward through time and see where typography can take us.

We'll look at examples of ways type has been used to impact user experience throughout history, and how typography has evolved to work with varying screens and content. It's a fundamental change in what it means to practice typography, and critical to understand how it impacts how we design. We'll also explore a few of the technical considerations and capabilities available to help create better typographic systems that will work well into the future.

alright awesome I think this pretty much

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,859
qualifies as a fairly full house

00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:11,639
congratulations I'm really happy to see

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,370
all of you here it always kind of amazes

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,820
me that over the last five years I've

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,180
gotten to give four or five drupalcon

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,310
talks about type and to have that kind

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,529
of interest in this sort of topic at at

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,990
such a technical conference is really

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,630
fantastic so thank you thank you all for

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,290
being here so I'm Jason palm and tell um

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,090
I am the senior director of design and

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,460
technical strategy at a company called I

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,460
so verra we're a development shop

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,820
outside of the Boston in waltham that

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,899
has built a lot of really interesting

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,510
and really well thought out drupal

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,340
solutions and one of the roles that I

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,800
have there is to actually build up our

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,539
design practice as well so we've started

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,719
to do that and really excited about that

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,820
and we're starting off with some pretty

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,369
interesting work for companies that want

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,979
to talk to us about persona development

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,320
and UX strategy and all kinds of really

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,390
fun things that are more what I'm used

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
to but it's really great to be able to

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,320
marry that with an awesome technical

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,210
team and I think that that's a really

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,070
nice way to put the power of Drupal

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,409
right in the middle and and that

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,320
actually fits in nicely with the way

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,590
that I like to work with Drupal also

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,570
from a design perspective as well and i

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,070
should say i think it's a mandatory by

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:38,040
line for anybody that does drupal

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,659
development yes we're hiring so i'm

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,060
going to talk to you today about a

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,220
couple of different things and all

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,829
centered around typography and user

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,259
experience and how one is such an

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,939
integral part of the other but how its

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,689
definition and how we have to practice

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,610
it has changed so we're going to go on a

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,170
little bit of a journey and for anybody

00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,549
that follows me on Instagram this is

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,100
pretty much what you'll see every

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,390
morning is me and my pal Tristan and he

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,469
goes with me on a lot of journeys and we

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,759
think about a lot of stuff in the

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,039
morning because we've got a really nice

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,879
peaceful area to kind of think things

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,140
through and so as someone who studied

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,050
graphic design

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,660
I always had a passion for typography

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,209
but I've also been involved in designing

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,670
and developing for the web since really

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,620
the very early days though my job on

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,400
campus in school was creating Rhode

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,980
Island colleges first website and that

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,680
was browser testing in mosaic and

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,459
Netscape one so that's my that's that's

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,500
my gray hair street cred and and so as a

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,560
lot of you can imagine for many many

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,709
years my love of typography and my work

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,709
on the web led very separate lives they

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,330
didn't date they didn't get along you

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,580
couldn't often find them in the same zip

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,170
code and that was something that I

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,000
really just had to live with and I would

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,760
sort of express my love of typography in

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,650
other ways or in making really awesome

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,040
buttons in Photoshop and adding lighting

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:08,250
effects to them at least there's a few

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,459
people to get that but that's really

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:14,310
changed a lot and so in 2009 that really

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,560
shifted web design for me and it made it

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,730
really exciting and interesting again so

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,140
what I want to talk about is is a future

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:28,230
that we can get to that allows us to

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,329
bring all of these wonderful ideas and

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,360
practices in traditional typography and

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:36,860
think about how they apply in a

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,239
different and unique way that's really

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,239
fundamentally different in how we have

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,709
to practice typography itself in the age

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,840
of dynamic digital systems so while I

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,510
was going to talk strictly about this

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,420
the history of typography as a core

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,970
element of user experience there was a

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,420
conversation that I was engaged in a

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,310
couple of months ago that really sort of

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,100
all of a sudden change something for me

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,400
and it really made me think about how

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,680
different typography is now not just

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,810
because it's on the web and because it's

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,810
on screens but because there are a lot

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,940
of important elements of how we practice

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,010
typography that we can't do in the same

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,440
manner not because it's not technically

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,570
possible but because it's in a totally

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,160
different context so I want to talk

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,820
about that as well so we're going to

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,830
look at a little

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,690
history and a little bit of the future

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,180
and a little bit of how we can adjust

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,360
our thinking to do this in a better way

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,990
and work with a wonderful system builder

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,090
that is Drupal in how we do it so let's

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,080
go back a little bit and look at the

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,970
history of typography and and really

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,620
think about the core of what is designed

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,090
what is it that we're doing and one of

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,270
the things that I think is true about

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,520
any piece of good design is that it has

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,180
to do two things it has to communicate

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,350
ideas and influence behavior that is

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,450
what sets design apart from art art you

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,250
want to communicate an idea you want to

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,340
get something across as an artist but

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,810
it's not intending to get someone to do

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,690
something to buy something to go

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,820
somewhere to change their ID their their

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,490
mind about something so really all

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,740
design can be traced back to this so it

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,190
follows that the influence that that

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:30,030
design exerts is imparted largely in how

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:32,100
we design so this is another great page

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,260
spread for some really classic

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,200
advertising or this beautiful piece from

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,050
Nike type has always played an integral

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,110
role in the message and the composition

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,930
of how we get that message across its

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,880
that bridge between that message and you

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:53,610
the viewer it creates that experience

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,350
but these are all print examples and as

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,880
we move forward and we start to think

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,430
about how communication has been

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,310
shifting into digital formats we're now

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,990
five years in to amazon selling more

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,600
electronic books and digital books than

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,670
print ones so we're well past the

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,020
tipping point in where people are

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,010
consuming things so this is Frank

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,220
Camaros book in ebook format and on the

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:20,490
web in HTML and also on mobile devices

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,880
and you can see that he's thought about

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:27,900
how that experience will work best in

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,600
that context of use so if any of you

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,700
have looked at the ePub standard you'll

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,200
know that there's a wonderful notion of

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,780
epub 3 that's been around for a few

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,730
years that exactly zero major vendors

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,129
are supporting which is really

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,139
unfortunate

00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,999
so we're stuck and in some ways what

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,039
he's able to do on the web is actually

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:49,429
better than what he's able to do in I

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,830
boss which is a real shame and you know

00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:53,719
looking around in cars we can see that

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,429
even those interfaces can have a nice

00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:58,159
typographic hierarchy and increased

00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:59,419
glance ability obviously I'm making that

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:02,409
part up because that doesn't actually

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,689
happen yet in most cars but it can

00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:07,309
especially when you think about the

00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:10,219
systems that are now launching from

00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:11,659
Apple's carplay and android auto those

00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:13,699
things are rolling out into the market

00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,959
now and that's a very powerful thing

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,979
going to come back to that in a minute

00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:21,939
so this future is definitely one that's

00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:24,409
worth pausing to admire but it's not now

00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,749
then now that we have is something

00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,360
different the material and method and

00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:31,069
the typeface itself are forming the

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,409
foundation of the user experience but

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:37,579
the relationship between those elements

00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:39,050
has fundamentally changed so we need to

00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,399
look back again now we're going to take

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,919
a little trip through history and think

00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:47,149
about a few thousand years back where

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:49,669
medium really was the message so whether

00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,679
or not this is real think about the

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,490
metaphor here for a moment these rules

00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:57,889
actually are set in stone that's a

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,189
fundamentally important thing underlying

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,889
how important these rules are in the

00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,360
story of the Ten Commandments you can't

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,889
you can't rewrite them you can't edit

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,539
them you can't hit the backspace their

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,149
absolute and that's how they're intended

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,829
to be and by telling the story that

00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:15,019
these things were literally carved in

00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:18,199
stone that helps reinforce that metaphor

00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:21,319
a key element of that experience or this

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,709
illuminated choir book this 15th century

00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,619
choir book that i saw in florence italy

00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:30,559
that is absolutely stunning this is

00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:33,430
something guided by the hand of god this

00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:36,289
was a priceless thing slaved over

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,389
metaphorically by the monks that would

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,819
hand write these these books there was

00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:43,219
something so precious about this that

00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:45,889
again helped reinforce the importance of

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,589
the words that were being conveyed or

00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:52,040
coming forward a little while to our

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,690
family copy of The Hobbit the beautiful

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,630
hardbound book that was

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,930
printed on a letterpress you know

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,340
probably early 60s I think this edition

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,290
dates back to so this is something that

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,750
was read to me and my brother when I was

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,000
five years old everything about the

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,400
proportion the readability the

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,070
typesetting it just it's perfect for

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,200
that book I still have it I cherish it

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,950
and I just I love the feel of everything

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,610
about it so there's something about the

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:24,260
intimacy of that story that is

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,320
reinforced by the way it's presented in

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,970
this cloth hardbound book another case

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,770
is where it's actually the typeface

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,470
itself that starts to embody the

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:36,470
experience so here we've got Johnston a

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,050
typeface that was something that

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,580
introduced is for an identity system

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:45,770
back in 1916 has now been in continuous

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,990
use for a hundred years and it has

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,990
become almost a national identity when

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,730
you see that typeface you know that

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,200
you're looking at something relating to

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,940
London or something that's there's some

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,460
very English and very British about that

00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,750
and even in a different color the shape

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,580
of those letters know that you're

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,740
underground I mean it's something very

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,310
sort of visceral about that you just

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,710
know we're looking at the london times x

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,320
that's where it came from they designed

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,260
that typeface to do two things to impart

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,270
authority and to work well on cheap

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,610
printed paper it's really fascinating

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,650
duality there where the shape of these

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,210
letter forms and the sturdiness and the

00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,800
symmetry of it was something that

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,810
conveyed the authority of the news

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,000
source but they'd also designed all

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,340
these really intricate little traps that

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,350
would help reproduce those letters more

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,310
cleanly on this very very inexpensive

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,589
paper but it is something that can be

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,839
improved upon because this would this

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,400
may be a screenshot from Downton Abbey

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,000
so I'm probably be called out on that

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,940
but this was a real thing ironing the

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,860
newsprint reduces ink transfer and makes

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,390
the paper stiffer and shiny or improving

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,920
the user experience in making those

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,320
wealthy enough to have someone iron

00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,360
their newspaper for them really

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:05,540
appreciate that experience just a little

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:07,339
bit more so going from then to now we

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,550
see a few we've seen a few examples of

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,040
how

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,040
type and its manifestation are a very

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,470
core element of this user experience but

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,940
what do we look at now what do we see

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,940
when we go and look at the web

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,880
unfortunately we see a lot of this

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:27,410
verdanna usually maybe 13 pixels so just

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,450
a little too small to be able to read

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,209
comfortably I mean the only saving grace

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,750
is that it's not have etiqa that's a

00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:40,220
small saving grace the technology has

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:42,950
taken over for so long that we've given

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,440
up we have so many websites out there

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,940
now that all we all we could do is get

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,100
the content management system up and

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,959
running you see the connection here I

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,329
mean we have this fantastic tool that

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,540
takes care of so much of the hard stuff

00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:59,300
about just getting things on screen that

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,250
we can now start to think about what is

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,690
the presentation to the user because

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,640
more and more this is exactly how

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,980
they're going to encounter it on some

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:11,240
sort of screen not on a nicely printed

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,640
sheet of paper so now getting past that

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,930
technical hard stuff and getting back to

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,750
really thinking about design and

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,300
experience is something that can help us

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,100
get past things like this got these

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,579
fractured identities across every

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,680
platform from physical device to apps to

00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,180
the website I love Garmin but they use a

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,350
different typeface in every one of them

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,390
and it drives me nuts or cars this is

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,600
the reality that we have today in our

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,950
Subaru I usually do a little test I put

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,240
this image up and I ask everybody to

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,990
raise their hand when they can tell me

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,970
what time it is yep everybody just hit

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,620
the bus because you've been looking down

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,560
for so long because what happens with

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,649
this kind of electronics is there so

00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,470
constrained with hardware and memory

00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:59,510
that they can't afford to put scalable

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,730
type in there so most of the UI is in

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,130
cars are constrained to only one or two

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,220
different type sizes so they can't they

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,870
truncate text they change labeling they

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,730
used like these really tiny little

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,620
displays that are really hard to find

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,709
when you're in a high speed high glance

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,540
kind of environment that's a big problem

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:20,180
so again this is where things like

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,990
carplay and android auto are going to be

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,730
really remark

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,040
because they put all of the tools

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,149
necessary to design for this environment

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,730
in our hands it's now something that can

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:33,560
be done by anyone who wants to work on

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:37,490
an app and you know how those displays

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,350
are all worked out in HTML and CSS we

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,360
can use web fonts we can use all of

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,240
these great technologies to design car

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,160
interfaces navigation interfaces all of

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,810
these things that are going to be in use

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,180
because they're going to be driven by

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,220
apps and not locked away in the purview

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,779
of only a few people that are

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,690
implementing these systems for these

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,029
manufacturers could be good could be bad

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,040
but it's a lot of opportunity and a lot

00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:04,540
more creative energy that could go into

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:09,380
making these interfaces great so our

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:13,790
present is far from perfect insert thing

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:16,190
about grammar nerds being tense so

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,170
what's changed why is this different now

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,209
how does this connect to what I mean

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,839
when I say practicing good typography

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:25,940
well pretty much everything and I mean

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,070
that actually literally the screen sizes

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,300
have changed there's over a thousand

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,110
different screen sizes and resolutions

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,490
that you have to really think through

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,399
there was a post from Luke Wroblewski

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,760
just a couple of days ago about how he

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,640
managed to do a bunch of analysis on I

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:47,510
don't know how many like ninety percent

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,250
of different user agent queries and the

00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,350
stuff that he was analyzing could be

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:56,329
brought down to only a hundred sixty two

00:14:51,350 --> 00:15:01,600
different viewport sizes only 162 is not

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:03,920
awesome so have fun with your test lab

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,690
but so that this is still a problem

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,380
doesn't matter if you could reduce it to

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:12,110
only 50 or only 40 I mean can any of us

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,470
really spend the time testing on 40

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,940
different devices maybe some of us have

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,910
to and maybe some of us have the luxury

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,490
but not everybody so we need to think

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:26,420
differently about the relationships

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,550
between type and the content itself and

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,470
the context in which it's being viewed

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,199
in a different way so if we look at this

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,700
website it has a lot of interesting

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,490
layout things that are going

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,130
on and I had some interesting type

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,510
relationships that work in a fairly

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,070
interesting manner especially if you

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,570
look at the type relationship with the

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,370
guy that contour of the guy's face

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,440
there's definitely some thought that has

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,870
been put into that except what about

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,310
when the screen slightly different but

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,020
at least they've thought about something

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,250
so on small screens that reflows a

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,590
little differently and it still has a

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,590
decent impact in the design and it works

00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:03,290
pretty nicely so what is it about this

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:05,660
kind of design that's different from the

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,180
way we could design and print and this

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,520
is what really came to me and jumped out

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,250
this notion of rendered versus dynamic

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,230
and and that's something that's really

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,020
important for us to understand and

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,570
embrace because as designers we want

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,420
control and we want to impose this

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,160
notion of relationships between elements

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,260
so if you look at this book cover from

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,480
émigré it's absolutely beautiful

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,060
relationships that they've designed here

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,610
that would never hold up as screen sizes

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,400
start to change but these letters stay

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,140
where you put them then it's like when

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,030
the baby learns to crawl I mean all of a

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,560
suddenly your type is moved over to some

00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,140
place else on the screen and you have no

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,690
idea where it went to next but even in

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,820
film where this this will be sequence

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,250
from the movie seven the credit sequence

00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,140
there honestly the best two minutes and

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,690
storytelling in film I mean you have to

00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:00,260
see it if you if you haven't yet and and

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:03,580
this came out gosh 15 plus years ago I

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,580
don't know it was really fan task tuck

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,980
reddit sequence more recently from the

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,520
show the Americans that brings about a

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,860
lot of really powerful memories but also

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,020
something that was completely defined

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,360
and controlled by the designer so even

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,730
though that moves over time it moves in

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,890
exactly predictable manner there's a

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,300
fixed aspect ratio for that credit

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,980
sequence and the type is always

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,770
overlaying the images in exactly the

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,840
same way whereas today in web and

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,040
digital products we have something

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,930
that's totally different so we're

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,440
looking at the Guardian site from the UK

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,940
we have to think differently when we're

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,250
thinking about a web system especially

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,050
one like drupal where the content is

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,260
entirely in the hands of the site owner

00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,680
we have screen size

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,690
and content that is never fixed it's

00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,520
always dynamics so the relationship

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,460
between the typography and the content

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,800
and the context is always in flux now we

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,170
see the international edition it's the

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,510
same layout the same typographic rules

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,660
but totally different content or if we

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:12,680
look at France 24 in english and in

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:14,360
french that's hard that's really tricky

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,450
stuff how'd you know designing a system

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,430
that can work with a one-line title or a

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,410
four line title because you have no idea

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,030
I mean I didn't even try putting German

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,010
in here because frankly I just don't

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,750
think I could make anything fit I don't

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,550
know how anybody designs a narrow column

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:35,030
of text in german I mean if anybody here

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:37,100
that does I applaud you and so define

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,370
the defining element of the experience

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,740
is often going to come down to it it's

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,600
it's actually the typeface because the

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,370
design elements change the length change

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,320
the meaning changes in the content

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,720
that's present so what is it that's

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,910
there to convey this system of design is

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,300
the typeface selection and how you've

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:59,120
implemented it so that way forward this

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,070
way forward to practice typography in

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,980
these environments that really requires

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,320
this new kind of thinking has to embrace

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,540
a bunch of key things not just the

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,940
content changing and the screen size

00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,250
changing but what about availability of

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,020
the typeface itself when you start out a

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,940
project and you're working on branding

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,710
or working with existing brand standards

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,350
and you need to bring that to the web is

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,880
the typeface available in a practical

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:28,510
and an affordable manner and what about

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,970
performance are they well made typefaces

00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:34,280
are they small are the typefaces well

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,750
optimized and there's a lot of stories

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,120
that we could get into here so if you

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,860
look at something like Benton sans it's

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,170
a wonderful typeface it's one of the

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,550
core elements in a large Ivy League

00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:49,100
school in Boston's ID system that they

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,140
don't use on the web and one of the very

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,910
valid reasons they don't use that type

00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,100
face on the web is that it would cost

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:59,180
twenty six thousand dollars a year to

00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:01,700
license it I don't blame them one bit

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,710
so that's something that really has to

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,230
be on our minds as designers when we're

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,150
making these decisions so there's

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,340
performance there's cost there's

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,590
compatibility there's licensing issues

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,440
and worked with another Ivy League

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:18,560
school in in Connecticut that had a

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,060
nearly fantastic web web font or rather

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,040
a typeface they were using in their

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,110
print identity we went back to the

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,170
vendor over in Europe and asked them

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,820
because nobody had bothered to do so we

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,500
just went asked and they came back and

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,540
gave us a price to license that typeface

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,030
across every website with no traffic

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,040
restrictions and now that typeface is

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,420
available for everybody on that campus

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,460
with all of their websites and that's

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,320
fantastic so those are all

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,600
considerations that we have to make as

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,880
designers but there's plenty of places

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,500
to go do that we've got fonts com where

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,200
you can use it online or buy licenses

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,230
you've got type kit you've got webtype

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,940
you've got my fonts you've got all of

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,430
these different vendors almost all of

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,410
them now have some kind of licensing

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,630
option we just need to do our homework

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,750
and take a look because even something

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:08,930
simple like is this typeface for example

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:11,330
Museo sounds very popular typeface if

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:15,230
you look at the place different places

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:17,240
it's available in Typekit fonts calm and

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,040
purchasing a license for self-hosting

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,170
there are different file sizes for every

00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,670
one of them and that can be really

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,830
important when you've established a

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,750
performance budget and you know you need

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:31,340
to keep your web font load to a minimum

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:33,230
saving five to eight caper weight is the

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,070
difference between six typefaces and

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:39,620
seven fonts more more accurately so

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,350
that's something that's a real important

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,530
consideration as well as optimization if

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,150
it's a rounded typeface back rounded is

00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:51,740
a great example that I pick on a lot in

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:54,590
my book that one is went from about 400

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,410
k when it first came out as a web font

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:00,050
down to 140 from one vendor last year

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:02,030
down to under a hundred from another now

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,830
it's a complicated type face because it

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,870
has a lot of rounded ends but they did a

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,850
huge amount of work optimizing that

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,770
typeface so if you think about a

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,740
performance budget you've now taken away

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:15,260
/ 25 / 75 percent of the files

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,900
sighs so it makes it a lot more

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:23,090
attainable to be able to use that on the

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:24,800
web yes yes you can who's the the

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,620
question was can you find those numbers

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,140
before you buy it in almost every case

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,590
you can because usually what you can do

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,929
is if you're using the services the

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,640
subscriptions are cheap I maintain one

00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,580
and all in several of the different

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,929
services so it's you can just go and set

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,800
up a kit you haven't really bought

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:47,300
anything specific for it but on on

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,010
several of the sites that I've looked at

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,660
they actually list the file sizes before

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,730
you would actually even make a purchase

00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,330
so you can usually find that that

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:59,390
information pretty easily I'm thousands

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,970
of choices to bring bring your voice to

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,400
it and thus the technical support that's

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:08,270
available in opentype so open type

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,950
features are a fantastic addition let me

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,740
rephrase that because it's a fantastic

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,100
addition for us in English it's usually

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:19,550
just a nicety to get better ligatures

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:21,440
different numeral support real fractions

00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,540
seeing that that's pretty nice in the

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,429
end the ligature is connecting the scene

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,679
the T up there those are all really

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,540
wonderful additions that are a nice

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,490
extra for us in English but in other

00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,620
languages those open type features are

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,080
actually necessary diacritics for

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,929
communicating effectively and properly

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,270
so the fact that all the browsers are

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:44,240
now supporting it makes a huge

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,460
difference in the level of clarity in

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,610
the communication that we can that we

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,080
can create for use on the web there's a

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:55,580
new version of wathah sort of more

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,200
common standard to support open type

00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,460
features woof tube introduces

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,860
twenty-five percent better file

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,830
compression it's only at about fifty

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,080
five percent support on can i use calm

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,970
right now so if you think of the total

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,010
number of devices that are on the web

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,410
only about fifty five percent of them

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,600
can display woof to the good news is

00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,309
often times when you set up a font

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,920
package many of the services are now

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:21,650
including woof too and will serve it to

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,630
the devices that can see it so it's sort

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,010
of a way to progressively enhance what

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,450
you're serving to your end users on

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,910
their browser can support it then it

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,440
comes along all of the major ones with

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,140
the exception of Safari are now

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,760
supporting woof too so that's that's a

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,740
pretty good a good thing to know about

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,880
um I bring all of these things up

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,380
because as designers we need to care and

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,130
we need to speak up about it or

00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:53,190
developers will fix it for us usually in

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:56,490
the wrong way witness flash of invisible

00:24:53,190 --> 00:25:00,000
text that drives me nuts there's this

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,950
default behavior that started with Apple

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,810
I actually blame them for this more than

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:07,170
anybody but the problem is everybody

00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:09,450
adopted this that rather than just put

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,670
the content on screen in a fallback font

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,680
every browser has adopted the standard

00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:17,610
of let's not put anything on screen

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:21,030
until the web font loads and as much as

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:23,010
I love design and a love type I love my

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,260
users more and I want to give them the

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,200
content and that's this that's what the

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:32,310
web is for is to deliver this content to

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:35,160
the end user so what I would prefer is

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,680
to go back to foul that was a feature

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,720
not a bug flash of unstyled text is this

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,750
practice of putting up the fallback font

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,700
while the web font is downloading with

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,740
the addition of things like the web font

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,530
loader when you use the web font loader

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,660
it injects a class in the head HTML

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,150
element of your page that tells you WF

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,370
active web fonts active or WF inactive

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,500
when you have that class you can now

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,020
style the fallback fonts to more closely

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,730
match the metrics of what's going to be

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,370
there when it loads so you can avoid the

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,410
reflow it's not the fact that the

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,820
typeface changes subtly it's the fact

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,410
that things move around is the

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,590
perception of change that's the biggest

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,700
deal so that combination is something

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,960
that's really important for us to

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,300
consider as designers to think about 375

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,460
million people using opera mini that

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,040
will never see a web font but do you

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,370
want your design to hold up you probably

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,350
do so using a technique like this one

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,780
where those web fonts will never be

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,940
active those users will get the right

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,270
design right away even with the fallback

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,879
font so those things are things that we

00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,759
have

00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:45,219
to speak up about to browser vendors to

00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,469
the developers that govern the way

00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:49,629
things are implemented in Drupal we have

00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:51,819
to learn as designers to participate in

00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:53,349
this process a little bit more and

00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,389
that's where we get to see these

00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:56,739
improvements because we need to be in

00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:59,440
those issue queues and we need to

00:26:56,739 --> 00:27:00,789
advocate for these better standards and

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,359
these better ways of implementing

00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:09,269
typography question the back I'm sorry

00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:12,159
the it's the google web font loader and

00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:15,309
it's it was an open source project that

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:18,369
was started between a type kit and

00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:20,529
google back in 2010 so it's been around

00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:23,349
for a very long time and many of the

00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:25,119
services will use that by default so if

00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:27,969
you use type kit if you use the

00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:31,059
JavaScript implementation of google web

00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:32,619
font embedding if you use fonts com they

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,599
have a different class name but it's

00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:36,609
basically the same idea it will always

00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:39,219
inject that class during the loading

00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:41,949
process and then remove it once the web

00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:43,899
fonts are fully loaded there are a

00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:46,509
couple of other things evolving in the

00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:49,690
CSS standard but nothing gives you that

00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:51,339
complete control over what you're going

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,649
to render and how to style those

00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:55,479
fallback so while font display is

00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:58,690
another CSS attribute that lets you

00:27:55,479 --> 00:28:00,789
control the timeout for when it decides

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,039
to flip over to displaying a fallback if

00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:04,959
the web fonts not there and it doesn't

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,539
really help you unless you can then tune

00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:11,940
those fallbacks to avoid the reflow of

00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:14,709
content so when we think in systems and

00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,139
we think about what happens when things

00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:18,899
don't work because inevitably they're

00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:21,489
not going to work in some scenario

00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:23,979
that's when we can really have that

00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:25,779
complete system and that complete

00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:28,569
experience so here's the london

00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:30,940
transport transport of london's digital

00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:32,409
design guide they're thinking about

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,999
these relationships at all these

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,289
different screen sizes they're thinking

00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:37,569
about line height they're thinking about

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:39,399
font size and how those relationships

00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:40,719
and meaning and importance hold up

00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,509
across all these different screen sizes

00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:46,509
this is what i mean when we're talking

00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:48,399
about the new typography so if we look

00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:50,589
at what some other people are doing on

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,509
the web I mean that's a didone to die

00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:53,710
for I mean it's absolute beautiful

00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:55,179
typeface and

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,860
you see how they implement that across

00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:59,020
different screen sizes and the design

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,210
really holds up that the feeling of that

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,399
and the meaning in the intent across

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,679
that is really wonderful where we look

00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:08,200
at Donnie trong site about via the

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,690
history of Vietnamese typography it's a

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,580
really beautiful website and he really

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,799
was very thoughtful and how it works on

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,510
small screens as well now what you'll

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,789
notice here if you're a really keen

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,350
observer is that there's a ligature

00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:22,000
between the s and the T in the word

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,700
history on the desktop site that's not

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,450
present on the small screen now this

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,940
screenshot I made back in February and

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:34,630
in between then and now Apple rolled out

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,640
an update to both iOS and desktop Safari

00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,919
that all of a sudden supports font

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,679
feature settings so without doing

00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:44,080
anything to his website because he had

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,039
used the proper CSS and was using open

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,659
type features it just started to work so

00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:51,100
he didn't have to do anything but all

00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:53,260
the font feature settings that were

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,870
there because the browser has now

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,600
improved itself to support that standard

00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:01,360
now everybody gets that same level of

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,610
Polish in the reading experience or if

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,250
you look at this website the Seattle

00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,500
Times designed by by mule design a mule

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:11,020
studio they've done a beautiful job of

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,330
using typography but embracing the

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,330
fluidity of the medium so that you can

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:18,370
see even though things reflow it still

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,130
maintains that same feeling and clarity

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:24,870
it's a really beautifully designed

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:24,870
website if you block out the ads

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,509
it's an unfortunate reality I don't want

00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:31,100
to pick on them and I don't want to

00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:34,730
detract from the quality of the

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:39,049
editorial design but boy is that system

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:42,620
broken we really need to fix that that's

00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:45,559
that's another day so to bring this back

00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,919
thinking about how typography worked in

00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,830
the past looking at this issue of

00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,960
monotypes recorder I picked this story

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,620
because it had some beautiful typefaces

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,269
and it had a really interesting layout

00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,970
that was very much central to

00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:04,460
reinforcing that that feeling of this

00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,230
piece it was about ghost signs and you

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,700
can see the typography used in the title

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,620
is really reminiscent of the kind of

00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,899
thing you'd see in old sign painting and

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,389
the the layouts are really beautiful the

00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:17,000
photography was really fantastic and I

00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:18,620
wanted to see how could we interpret

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,259
this how could we take beautiful

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,169
editorial design and do that on the web

00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:26,450
so when I was teaching a workshop last

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,730
year at the typos conference in Berlin I

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,620
used this as the example so what we

00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:34,519
moved to now is the interpretation in

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:37,850
HTML and CSS using web fonts and so you

00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:40,429
can see going through this that I've

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:43,129
really tried to preserve the feeling of

00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:44,629
that layout but this is all done with

00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:46,700
only a couple of additional classes

00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:49,340
added in there and it's also entirely

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,409
responsive and it really I think did a

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,029
good job of capturing the feeling in the

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,769
intent of that design while still

00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:56,750
delivering it in an appropriate way for

00:31:54,769 --> 00:32:01,629
the device upon which it was being

00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:04,039
viewed so that was embracing a system of

00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:06,710
constraints that can apply and adapt

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,769
across these different screen sizes and

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,840
modes of use never mind whether or not

00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,580
that content keeps changing so we can

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,500
embrace different kinds of units of

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,899
measure and we can embrace different

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,769
techniques in detecting touch or the

00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:24,500
support of web fonts and we've now

00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:27,409
managed to shift from that rendered

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,080
normal to a dynamic future and that's

00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,299
really really really important because

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,490
this is such a dramatic shift and it's

00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,529
such a total shift of how we consume

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,990
content into these digital dynamic

00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:42,200
systems with the screen

00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:44,030
getting smaller and smaller the only way

00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,429
that we can convey this voice and tone

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,320
is increasingly going to be by the type

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:52,610
that we use to do it that is going to be

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,530
the one thing left on the screen so when

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,960
we look at things like these statistics

00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:59,570
from statista about smartphone

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,280
penetration just here in the US and bear

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,679
in mind in the u.s. it's probably lower

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,210
than anyplace else in the world we're

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,150
already at about eighty percent

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:10,760
penetration of smartphones just in this

00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:13,700
country now I think that's really

00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,670
remarkable because that really means

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,840
it's moving very far downstream if you

00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:22,309
look at all kinds of age demographics

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,800
cultural demographics income

00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:26,480
demographics the fact that when people

00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,760
have to make a choice are they going to

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,040
have broadband access or are they going

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,920
to have a phone they're going to buy a

00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,360
phone and that phone will then be one of

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,880
these free ones that they can get with

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,030
Android or a very low cost iOS phone and

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,890
a data plan because that will be the one

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,080
way did they get online especially that

00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:47,300
whether you look at something based on

00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,830
economics or something based on age I

00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,200
mean I can tell you with certainty that

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,080
the last thing on my son's mind who's a

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,670
junior in college as he moves into

00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,340
getting his own place for that for next

00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,780
year sure they want Wi-Fi but they care

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,150
about whether or not the cell reception

00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,390
is good I mean that's really kind of the

00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:07,550
driving thing so the first way that

00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:10,460
people interact with things is going to

00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,169
be on the phone it's a small screen it's

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,560
dynamic content it's the only way

00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:18,679
they're getting their news so fifty

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,230
percent or more get their news on this

00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,530
device one in five have little to no

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,020
broadband access at all so that's really

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,879
interesting stuff as we think about like

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,240
what are our tools as designers to get

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,300
this across and that was summed up

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,710
really nicely just this past week

00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,260
Matthew Rex is the general manager of

00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,879
Typekit over at Adobe and he pointed out

00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,710
that this is only the second

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,649
presidential election where web fonts

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,929
have been a thing if you really want

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:50,780
some context go back to more election

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:52,790
cycles and there's no i phone i mean the

00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,380
pace of change that we have here is

00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,419
but the important thing right now is

00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,670
when you think about how a presidential

00:34:56,419 --> 00:35:01,900
candidate gets their message across how

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,010
they connect what voice do they convey

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,410
increasingly the only way it's going to

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:09,800
get to people is going to be on a phone

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:13,730
so Zach Leatherman did it's really funny

00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,320
post he decided to rank all presidential

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:18,470
candidates by their use of and

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,170
implementation of web fonts as he puts

00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,880
it out he is a single issue voter so

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,350
he's one of the developers at the

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,120
filament group and he's written a lot of

00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:29,090
really interesting stuff on web font

00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,070
implementation and as he summed it up

00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,770
Hillary Clinton probably is is the

00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,510
winner here because she actually paid

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,490
for a custom typeface that she's

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,620
self-hosting and does a pretty good job

00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,630
implementing it he does point out at

00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,430
eight seconds to web font render time

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,080
but I took a little look at that website

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,270
and five and a half seconds is the

00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:51,380
optimizely JavaScript blocking page

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:55,730
render that's a fixable thing load

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:58,310
asynchronously remember that so what we

00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,970
have to remember is that for there to be

00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:05,920
any experience at all your content has

00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,920
to be there thank you very much

00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:18,280
so so we've got two left a lot of time

00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,710
for questions because that tends to be

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,510
what I get more of than people wanting

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:26,110
to listen to me talk but there's a

00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:29,050
couple things to mention that link here

00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:30,730
on the left bit ly JP drop cap DC will

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,350
take you back to the session page and

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,720
immediately after i'll be uploading the

00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,640
slides and it's also the evaluation page

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,580
if we don't know how you liked it it's

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,110
really hard for us to judge whether or

00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,480
not we're really hitting the mark so

00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:47,020
it's really very helpful if you would do

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:51,040
that JP drop cap DC is the bitly link

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,930
and if you're curious it's cardamon

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,430
inquire sands or the two typefaces that

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:57,460
I've used both of which came from

00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:00,340
monotype and immediately after this at

00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,380
three-fifteen downstairs in the event

00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,300
hall at the drupal association booth i

00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,280
have a limited number of copies of my

00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,950
book for free that i will happily sign

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,500
if you would like me to do so and if

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,960
you're here on Friday please please

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,850
consider coming to the sprints even if

00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,620
you don't know how to code at all there

00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,750
will be people there to teach you how to

00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,810
get involved it's a very rewarding

00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:25,660
experience I am one of those three

00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:29,320
thousand plus contributors to d8 it was

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,880
three commits three individual things

00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,560
that I got to sit down and work with

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,920
somebody on that made it into that

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:41,290
official contribu al could be doing that

00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,660
too because we need tons of UX help we

00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:46,060
need tons of documentation help it just

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,220
takes a few minutes of your time to have

00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,750
somebody show you where to find the

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,030
things that you're comfortable working

00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,460
on now I'm making a bit of an assumption

00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,800
that i'm talking to a lot of designers

00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,500
and i have no idea if that's true so if

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,510
you're all coders and you all contribute

00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,630
awesome for you shame on me I apologize

00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,890
but it has been my experience and one of

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,500
the reasons I ran for the drupal

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:11,110
association this year was to try and

00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,600
help increase engagement in the design

00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:15,760
community so it's really a big part of

00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,550
what I want to do as a contributor in

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,650
Drupal is to help more people like us

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,810
take our design knowledge and make that

00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,250
part of what makes Drupal better because

00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,020
as we saw from the keynote this morning

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,450
that is what is

00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,940
one of the most important drivers in

00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:33,010
adoption of Drupal is the site building

00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:37,150
and authoring experience and that is all

00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:38,980
about UX and design so questions if

00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,270
anybody has one we'd love to hear it

00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,130
there's a microphone right here so we

00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:48,390
can capture for the recording please

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:50,440
come up and ask anyone yeah please

00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,740
either that or I have to repeat the

00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,230
questions and all right do you have some

00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,110
sort of quick takeaways on the Google

00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,580
web fonts in terms of pro con pitfalls I

00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:03,700
mean obviously it's a limited library

00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:08,710
but it's readily available and accepted

00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:12,610
um it is so I don't really have anything

00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:14,890
against Google web fonts what I have a

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,930
challenge with at times is the level of

00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,750
quality of the typefaces that are there

00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:22,060
because quite often you're getting what

00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,680
you pay for and that's nothing against

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,660
the people that want to contribute their

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,160
things to open source but as designers

00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,680
and communicators we need complete

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,810
character sets we need things that are

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,650
well hinted to work well on windows as

00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:38,140
they do on the Mac so the thing that you

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:42,360
have to do is really test them well and

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:44,920
so the performance is really pretty good

00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,870
they obviously have a little money to

00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,960
throw at that so that's that's a good

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,640
thing one of the best bits of advice I

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,340
can give you is actually something I got

00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,870
from my friend Steve Hickey and is that

00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,490
look at the number of weights and

00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,650
variants that have been provided and

00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,930
that's a really good indicator of the

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,700
level of quality is it a professional

00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,830
typeface designer that has been working

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,780
on this yep so if it's a bigger family

00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:09,130
if you look at merriweather like that's

00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,630
a really great example it's a

00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:12,400
beautifully designed typeface it's

00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,380
actually part of the the core of the

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,940
u.s. digital services new design

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,760
guidelines for government websites

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,520
because it has a huge variety in weights

00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,620
and variants and so that's a sign that

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,630
this typeface has been really thoroughly

00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,210
tested it's very complete it has a

00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,700
complete Unicode character set so it

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:34,180
will be a very serviceable typeface to

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:38,140
use if you see a lot of things where

00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,400
there's you know 11 wait that's

00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,890
something that I

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,150
would test thoroughly think about the

00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,400
character set that you need and make

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:48,460
sure it's all present test it really

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,349
heavily on Windows vs mac and older

00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,510
versions in IE and that sort of thing to

00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:53,980
check for a rendering quality those are

00:40:52,510 --> 00:41:12,970
usually the places where you'll you'll

00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:14,950
see some problems so the question was

00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,319
about getting previews in different

00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:20,619
sizes and most services will allow you

00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,690
on a type testing page to change the

00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,819
type size change the characters that are

00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,329
being used in the in the display so it

00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:29,859
does vary with each service but most of

00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:31,779
them do have the ability for you to put

00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:33,430
in your own string of text change the

00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:35,559
type size and see you know make it

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,240
really big make it really small because

00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,160
you really want to test that and see

00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,380
some typefaces work really well at large

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,450
sizes and are very very tough to read at

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,990
small ones so might be good for headings

00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:48,190
might not be great for body copy I think

00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:53,880
there was another hand in the back there

00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:53,880
a minute ago no oh there we go

00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:06,890
so the question is about controlling

00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:10,590
line breaks and that's a tricky question

00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,820
or rather a tricky answer because there

00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,460
are a few different strategies that you

00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:20,130
can employ now the one that I've found

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:22,740
to be the most frustrating is usually as

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,600
screen sizes change getting widows or

00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,240
orphans that one word on the end of a

00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,670
line and that is actually one of the

00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,590
easiest things to fix so if you're

00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,660
working in anything up to Drupal 7 go

00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:37,020
get the typography module and turn it on

00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,990
and you're done that's it and what it

00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,850
does among other things is replace the

00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,470
space between the last two words of

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,540
every paragraph with a non-breaking

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,700
space character so it addresses it as an

00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,500
input filter on the server before it

00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,060
ever gets served to the client you'll

00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,440
never have one word at the end of a

00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:57,630
paragraph again barring that and I and

00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,510
so you know hint hint anybody want to

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:03,120
work on a d8 conversion and it's been my

00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,680
favorite module four years and it does a

00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,930
bunch of other things like fix smart

00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,790
quotes so it will make sure that has

00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,620
proper apostrophes in quotation marks

00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:13,400
without you ever having to do anything

00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:16,680
so that's a really nice nice touch and

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,870
if you can't do that on the server side

00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,720
or in the moment at the moment you might

00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:23,550
be working with a d8 site where it might

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,740
not be available I actually don't know

00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:31,740
if it is I haven't looked thank you

00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:36,390
typography so there is a way forward

00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:38,850
here it is a PHP plug-in that you can

00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,130
get that's just called PHP typography

00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:42,870
and you could actually incorporate that

00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,790
into your theme if you wanted to just

00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,010
without actually going through the

00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:49,140
module but one second let me just

00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:52,470
someone finish this thought and the

00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:55,350
other way you can do this is using Widow

00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,120
tamer which is a java javascript little

00:43:55,350 --> 00:44:01,620
plugin from Nathan Ford that you can

00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:03,510
find on github and there's also another

00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,040
one that Nathan Ford's been working on

00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,500
that's more complete but Widow tamer

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,180
allows you to just define the element

00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,950
that you want to fix quote unquote

00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,260
whether it's a P tag or ahead

00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:16,200
or whatever and how many characters you

00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:18,839
want to always be on the last line so

00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,060
you could save 15 characters and pin

00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,280
that to the resize event so anytime the

00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,200
window resizes then it's going to check

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,240
and make sure that it always has a few

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,820
words on the last line or 15 characters

00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,980
and then a line break of a word break so

00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,130
there are a few different strategies I

00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,710
cover a lot of those things in in my

00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:41,190
book which you can get on Amazon and

00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,720
O'Reilly oh and if you are interested so

00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,390
if anybody want a discount code for all

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,310
riley books okay i kind of figured

00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,109
because it's not good on just mine it's

00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,609
for egging anything from o'reilly if

00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:54,380
you're buying anything on the o'reilly

00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:56,880
website use the code off d aut HD and

00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,890
that's good for I think forty percent

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,010
off print and fifty percent off ebooks

00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:04,650
tell him I sent you but don't tell

00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:07,190
anybody outside this room so you had a

00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,190
question in the back

00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:24,320
so okay so the question was about

00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:26,810
hanging punctuation so if you were

00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,900
watching carefully you will have noticed

00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,700
that in Frank Camaros book in that first

00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,980
paragraph the quotation marks are

00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:38,180
hanging beautifully only on the first

00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:40,670
line that's the only easy fix that I've

00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,650
found so the notion hanging punctuation

00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,180
is so that the word the characters are

00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,970
all lined up in a margin but any

00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,560
quotation marks or or punctuation around

00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,810
it would be hanging out in the margin

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,110
which is a much nicer way to typeset

00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:57,170
things that's really really difficult to

00:45:54,110 --> 00:46:00,950
do when it happens in the middle of a

00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:04,490
paragraph and I don't know really of a

00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:06,740
good way to to manage that unfortunately

00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,780
it's easy to do when it's the beginning

00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,000
of a paragraph so you can address many

00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,010
of the circumstances well that comes up

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,680
you could do something with a simple

00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:18,620
conditional where if one of those

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,870
quotation marks is falls in the first

00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:23,210
letter because that's something you can

00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,740
detect for and CSS so first of type

00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:27,080
first letter is actually a pseudo

00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,450
selector you can use you could actually

00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:33,080
do something in your twig templates that

00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:35,330
would look for that and actually set a

00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,310
negative margin or at a class to sort of

00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:41,740
bump it out that would be one way to

00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:45,140
handle it not perfect but it would help

00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:47,540
Thanks so on multilingual sites do you

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,000
have a good way to to handle different

00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,740
font definitions different font families

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,510
for different languages when you're

00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,760
using no translation or field

00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:58,220
translation and also the different sizes

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,660
because I work with I'm in Japan and so

00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,160
all of my websites are English and

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,290
Japanese some of them are bilingual and

00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,670
the problem is that the Japanese fonts

00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,400
actually we need them to be a little bit

00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:08,720
bigger sure English and it doesn't work

00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,790
I can't make them a different size

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,650
although if you define the Japanese

00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,640
fonts families first and then the

00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,099
english font families

00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,240
conflict because the English it won't be

00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,250
applied to the English because they're

00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,960
not in the right Unicode range right do

00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:24,920
you have a solution for science or you

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,829
have a better way to so there's actually

00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,190
a there's a relatively straightforward

00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:33,769
way to handle that actually by tying

00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:36,829
into a similar solution to tuning

00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:39,740
fallback fonts as long as you can get

00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:41,990
the language encoding for the page as a

00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:43,730
class which is usually not that hard to

00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:46,130
do using different multilingual

00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:48,680
solutions so add that as a clap the

00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:51,470
language encoding as a class in the HTML

00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,500
and then you could scope your CSS for

00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:57,170
when that class is present on that

00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,539
particular element alter your your type

00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:02,089
size so that would be a way to handle it

00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:04,339
kind of across the board and and

00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:06,440
probably tie into things in a little bit

00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:08,420
simpler manner because just solving that

00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,430
one issue of getting that class in your

00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:13,279
HTML is probably the easiest thing that

00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:15,920
you could do I haven't done that myself

00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:17,390
but that's that's tended to be a way

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,460
that I've been able to scope a lot of

00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,630
simple solutions that way and that would

00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:27,250
certainly give you the control you're

00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:27,250
looking for any other questions

00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:45,040
so the question is best practices about

00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:52,000
websites or resources for for typography

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:53,650
and typographic systems well the website

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that I've put up to house a lot of

00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:58,480
things about my book has a lot of

00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:02,020
presentations and sample code and so r

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:04,960
WT io is that website if you look

00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:06,609
through the resources I need to add more

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,380
there but you'll see links to a bunch of

00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:10,780
things I have a bunch of things on

00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,869
github that actually include a lot of

00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:15,400
sample size systems so if you use SAS

00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:16,750
it's really easy to incorporate but i

00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,710
also have workshop code that's just

00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:22,619
straight CSS so that's one reference

00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:25,809
there's also a really fantastic book

00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:27,940
online from donny trong the one who did

00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:30,130
that Vietnamese typography if you look

00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:32,950
up professional web typography I think

00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:35,470
it's called Pro webtype com basically

00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,359
he's written on even more up-to-date and

00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,349
comprehensive version of what I've

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,589
written that's is free and available

00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:44,890
online kind of undercuts my book sales

00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:48,640
but um but it's really thoughtfully done

00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:52,150
there's also it's a little dated but if

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,119
you were to look at the elements of

00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,500
typographic style on the web that's

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,230
something you'd probably have to google

00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,240
I don't remember the the URL but it was

00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,099
an adaptation of Robert bring Hurst's

00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,940
book the elements of typographic style

00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:09,609
done by i think it was it might have

00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,020
been John John tan and rich rudder I

00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:12,910
know rich Rutter was one of the people

00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:15,400
who's the founder of clear left and also

00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,589
font deck so he's an incredible resource

00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,410
on typography he also has a book coming

00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:22,770
out soon that he did on Kickstarter

00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:25,510
that's going to be about web typography

00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,549
so there's a few different things that

00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:30,549
you could find also if you just research

00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:31,690
Bram Stein or Tim Brown they're two guys

00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:33,460
that work with Typekit that have

00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:36,099
published a tremendous amount of really

00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:38,440
helpful resources the state of web

00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:41,589
typography com is another really good

00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,450
resource that lists a lot of other good

00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:45,070
things that you can find online so

00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,840
there's a growing body of

00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,550
work out there now that can really help

00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:54,400
you get a good starting point anybody

00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,890
else have any questions awesome leave

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,690
has been absolutely amazing if anybody

00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,730
wants to continue the conversation come

00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:04,200
with me downstairs and and I'm going to

00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,200
