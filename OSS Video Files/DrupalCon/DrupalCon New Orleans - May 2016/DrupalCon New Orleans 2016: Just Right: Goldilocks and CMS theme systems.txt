Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Just Right: Goldilocks and CMS theme systems
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	How do we design a CMS theme system that satisfies widely differing user personas at once? Is it possible to provide excellent user experiences for frontend developers, backend developers, and UI users at the same time? How do we balance flexibility, complexity, security, and other factors?

We will explore this problem space from several different angles:

How popular CMSes prioritize different user personas

Why the themer experience is more difficult in a CMS than a framework

How to evolve without losing backwards compatibility

Why security is an important part of designing a theme system

How we can improve the themer experience in the future

After an introductory analysis we will open the floor to a discussion of these problems and potential solutions.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,790
think we're going to get started so just

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,269

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,340
and CMS theme systems thanks for coming

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,340
we want to get a discussion going so

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,960
we're gonna have about a roughly 20

00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,370
minute presentation just to kind of

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,800
frame things and talk about some

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:06,299
different concepts and then we'd like to

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,439
hear some ideas and get talking so yeah

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,600
mike is in the middle of the room there

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,700

hear me ok everyone ok thank you ok so

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,280
let's start by introducing what we are

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,610

you can find me with different variation

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,320
of my first name louder with three eyes

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,409
and the number of eyes is not variable

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,110
it's always the same people tease me

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,080
about that i'm a drupal developer

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,930
working for droid i'm also a Drupal 8

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,230
team system co maintainer

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,930
all right I'm Scott Reeves known as

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,569
Scott sir on drupal.org and Twitter and

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:28,769
some other places and I don't have any

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:31,859
other variants either got sir so I'm

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:35,069

along with Lowry and Joelle and fabian

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,319
and i think that's it me no know there's

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,959
other people but anyway evill jen xia i

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,290
saw his face on a stick earlier so that

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,129
was fun web chick has like a little

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:53,250
anyway I also maintained the stable base

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,799
theme in Drupal 8 and I'm more recently

00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:01,859
a provisional core committer for Drupal

00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:04,019
8 thank you mostly focusing on theme

00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,419
stuff front end things and just helping

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,329
out where I where I can also a team lead

00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:12,750
at digital echidna 50-person Drupal shop

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:15,810
out of london canada and let's jump in

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:20,159
yeah so more than uses hot pink this is

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:23,430
deep pink so let's start with with the

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,220
problem that we are discussing today so

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,720
we have some personas that the theme

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,419
system has to deal with so this is the

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,449
base for the complexity that we have so

00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,609
the first and the most obvious persona

00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,549
these are by the way developer persona

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:45,720
so a end user of a site is not one of

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:49,259
the personas of a team system they don't

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,389
know that theme systems exist so the

00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:56,459
front end developer / steamer is the

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:59,430
most obvious persona they have the most

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,609
power of using the theme system they

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,340
have the last word how things are going

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,650
to go to the browser so they can change

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,419
basically everything that is coming from

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,870
the back end or whatever the site

00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:15,389
builders has decided the second persona

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,180
that we have recognized is a back-end

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:20,459
developer in Drupal back-end developers

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,000
usually used theme system so that they

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,670
simply just input data into the team

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,120
system to be to be rendered in a way

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,970
a there is order type of theme systems

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,570
which don't have this kind of a workflow

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:40,410
but this is how the most of the open

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,910
source CMS is worth four quid and the

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,670
third persona which is way different

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,830
from the two previous ones is a site

00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:50,070
builder because Saudi builders may

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,620
change the visual look of a page by

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,200
using let's say color module or they

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,920
might use panels to create layouts for

00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,310
pages or they might use we are views and

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,980
create classes in the markup so these

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,550
three user personas are very different

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,600
different as you might imagine and

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,650
accommodating these different personas

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,230
is sometimes very very difficult also

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,910
the decision-making between twistys

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,990
treat people is very difficult who

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,600
should be paradise over another and

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,370
different CMS's do prioritize these user

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,020
personas differently we're going to talk

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,820
more about that in a bit so in in

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,380
preparing this core conversation we

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,940
looked at some other open source

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,830
projects just to see what they're doing

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:43,350
for personas not necessarily from like a

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,720
like an admin UI UX kind of thing but

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,970
just in general for the project so we

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,480
looked at Mozilla so there there's a

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:55,170
link here to do what they have and they

00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,110
basically documented a probably about a

00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,880
dozen or so personas when each one has a

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,100
name and a description of kind of what

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,600
they would do and also sort of a title

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,060
so we're just going to kind of breeze

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,160
through a handful of those so they have

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,460
like George who is a designer they have

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,260
Denise who's a lightweight JavaScript ER

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,940
we didn't really look into what that

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,300
means but anyway it's pretty specific

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,590
right so they have almost like for us

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,470
it's like we could have different types

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,820
of themed errs maybe but we also have

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,850
Emily who's a corporate web app

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,470
developer and Alexander who is a Firefox

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,670
add-on developer which we thought was

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,070
kind of interesting because it's like

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,420
module developer for us which we don't

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,250
necessarily separate from back-end

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,420
developer but we maybe we could and we

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,200
should

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:44,740
so like Laurie was mentioning like the

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,530
prioritization of these different roles

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,750
or personas can really affect how you

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,910
work with them how you work with

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,790
something like the theme system maybe

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,690
how flexible it is how much control you

00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:00,820
have perhaps it's also kind of how

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,230
usable it is for you as that type of

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:07,360
user and what we've what our opinion is

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,910
anyway is that often this prioritization

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,820
is not explicit when something is being

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,650
built often it's whoever is driving a

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,120
certain change whatever their kind of

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,530
persona is like they're at the top of

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,450
the list like their number one priority

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,580
because they're like yes I want this

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,630
thing and there's nothing necessarily

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,480
wrong with that but I think we should be

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:30,940
a bit careful with that because it can

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,430
get us into situations that might not be

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,800
the best just to advant is that we're

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,720
going to show some priorities of

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,510
different CMS's the idea is not to

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,230
compare them as which one is better than

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:47,110
another but instead to to explicitly

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:49,120
show that it is it is possible to give

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,700
different priorities and this is just a

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,720
screenshot of a team that we built on

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,520
wordpress it is bartok visual on purpose

00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,760
so we wanted to prove that we actually

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,950
did use the other team systems of

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:07,870
diferencia masses yeah Lowry gets all

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,480
the credit for this one and it's yeah

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,230
it's got some like finish hockey text or

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,490
something in there so it's pretty fun

00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,040
and yes so so what's going to follow

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,010
it's definitely not scientific it's it's

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,490
just opinion it's you know based on our

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,810
knowledge of Drupal and then based on

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,700
almost like a first impression of some

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,410
other systems because we haven't really

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,970
worked extensively with any of these

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,170
other ones but we kind of looked into

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,610
them we played around with them looked

00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:39,010
at the code looked at the templates and

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:42,160
so on so yeah so for Drupal this is what

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,620
we landed on site builder is usually

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,150
kind of gets gets quite a lot of power

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,790
and

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,890
then back end like there's a lot of kind

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,240
of API things that you can do a Drupal

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,350
and there's four maybe I and things like

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,630
that which we'll talk about a little bit

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,920
later and then the themer kind of gets

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,350
like the short end of the stick

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,700
sometimes and this actually we didn't

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,040
really mean this but for this to happen

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,570
but this did actually line up with three

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,370
slides from this morning where he was

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,410
showing like the survey the survey

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,750
results of who do you think we should be

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:16,850
prior to prioritizing so at least based

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:20,030
on our opinion we're doing okay ish but

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,680
again like I it's our opinion that we

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,960
should probably have more fine-grained

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,760
personas than just these to really

00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,520
figure out what we may be missing and

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,500
what we can improve and potentially even

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,210
pull in new people into Drupal that are

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,580
not using it yet and maybe they have

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:40,730
their reasons and wordpress theme errs

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:44,750
tend to like WordPress it's maybe not as

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:48,470
clean per se but it's very flexible you

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,700
can do quite a lot in the theme and to

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,440
the extent that you know certain things

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,140
are almost hard-coded but like you have

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,610
the ultimate control and site builders

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,230
can do quite a bit in WordPress as well

00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,960
and we kind of put back in last because

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,950
there's not as much of like an API like

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,990
intense like drupal has in WordPress and

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,060
we looked at joomla I guess I should I

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,290
don't know if it has the ! anymore but

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:15,800
yeah it'll always have the exclamation

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,110
yeah it's in the trademark so yeah this

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,760
is this is yeah not the real joomla

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,920
apparently that I was trying it was a

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,960
counterfeit jun hwa maybe anyway for

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,350
joomla we found that there was quite a

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,880
lot again that the site builder could do

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,910
one interesting thing that I noticed is

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,840
that blocks well they call them modules

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,160
which is confusing for us but blocks I'm

00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,110
just going to call them blocks blocks in

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,780
joomla you can do things like you can

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,310
schedule the publishing of a block or

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,650
the unpublishing a block and i thought

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,110
that was really interesting and I was

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,310
like that's cool feature and you can do

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,740
some really intense stuff where you're

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,930
really like affecting the mark-up from

00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,280
the UI we mostly looked at the block you

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,950
i but i'm sure there's other things you

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,510
can do to the femur is it's

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,550
ordem in a similar position wordpress

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,100
for movie saw it's not necessarily super

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,170
clean like from our perspective if you

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,110
open up the template file it's like they

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,060
have almost the entire theme layer at

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,800
the top of their template file it's like

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,380
they have setting up some variables and

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:23,390
then pre-process and then up like output

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,920
the HTML all in one file so yeah it's

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,300
but it's very flexible like you can

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,860
change it if you're a theme or you just

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,970
be like oh I can just mess with this

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,720
especially if you know a little bit of

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,850
PHP but that could get dangerous and

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,730
then back end we honestly don't know too

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,290
much about the back end but it just

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,760
again it seems similar to WordPress in a

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,490
way that it maybe wasn't quite as

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,070
powerful and Drupal in terms of

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,530
integrations and things like that and

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,030
concrete5 the site builder can do a lot

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,780
of cool stuff you can drag around the

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,000
blocks visually and things like that and

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,860
then the backend stuff there's quite a

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,150
lot of cool like there's like helpers to

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,340
build forms and stuff like that like

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,380
they have like a helper class where you

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,780
can output form elements and form labels

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,080
and it seems more gear to like a

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,970
hardcore PHP developer and so the theme

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,130
are like that you can do stuff but if

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,020
you need to change things specifically

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,120
like you might run into trouble because

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,440
they're using like these form helper

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,180
classes and things like that like it

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,550
might be sort of hard coded the markup

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,470
that you get out of that so in the end

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,350
we landed on the same prioritization as

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,550
Drupal for this one which we're not sure

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,840
that maybe that's something that we can

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,240
talk about is like should we be looking

00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,800
at systems that are similar or should we

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,450
be just saying like no they've already

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,440
made the same decisions that we made we

00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,060
should be looking at something that's

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,800
radically different and see if that

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:45,590
inspires some ideas so food for thought

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,440
yeah so now we've talked about the

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,810
possibilities of para prioritizing so

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,580
let's take a little bit into the

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,280
problems that this has caused that we

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,410
have the different user personas and we

00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:01,760
have been trying to fulfill the needs of

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:05,420
all of them so the the first problem

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,970
that we have is security we fight we had

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,090
a huge fight with the beta ultra escape

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,760
in the past couple years we had to do it

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,390
twice to get it right

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,390
and that illustrates how complex system

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,580
we are talking about it was huge effort

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,560
the problem in outer escape and the

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,630
security that the team system tries to

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,550
manage is that there is a lot of

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,520
user-generated content and there is

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,140
blackened devil a condom markup

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,240
generated by the packing developers and

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,720
there is markup generated by the teamers

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,390
and we have to always be identifying

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,700
where the mark-up is coming from in

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:48,620
order to escape the right things the

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:51,290
right way so maybe we would allow less

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,310
things happen unless places it would be

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:57,260
simpler to build things like this the

00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,120
backwards compatibility was also

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,890
anything another thing that we have been

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,440
waited fighting with so we created

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,440
stable into the team system to support

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,180
backwards compatibility like in in

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,460
general backwards compatibility is

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,390
simple it's just that you can't change a

00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:16,310
thing but in order to allow changing

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,960
things without breaking things without

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,510
changing them you have to create a

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:24,800
system that allows you deduce so which

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:27,020
creates the complexity and this is maybe

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,330
just one of the features not only that

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,910
we have user personas that we need to

00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,740
with we need to fulfill maybe if we

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:36,440
would have more flat more fine-grained

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,110
user personas we could figure out that

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,940
maybe this is a something that we don't

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,920
really have to consider and when we were

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,410
making this description of adding stable

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,910
we actually had to create ourselves in

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,520
that meeting the different themer

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,590
personas in order to make be able to

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,790
make the decision that was never

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:57,350
documented anywhere publicly that in a

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,720
way that it would be used to make

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,720
ordered officials that it might affect

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,920
another problem that that the theme

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:14,300
system has is always that it has the

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:16,520
power to change things they can pick and

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,730
basic in the team the team ER can

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:23,300
basically do anything they want you and

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,180
that creates the sometimes a false image

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,470
of how flexible the system is because

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,420
you might be breaking something

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,660
in some other place so let's say if

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:36,050
you're building a site for a hairdresser

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,700
you might be able to compromise some

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,730
things let's say you might be taking

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,190
data straight from a node object in your

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,550
note template which breaks the field you

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,440
I totally but on that one specific site

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,900
which is a small side you might be able

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,600
to make that trade-off that ok I might

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,220
not need to feel you I because I can do

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,740
this this way and it's so much simpler

00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,050
but when you're building a something

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,940
enjoyable core or something in in a

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,250
module you can't really do that and then

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:10,450
you see the real complexity that that is

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:14,420
over there so all of these things are

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:17,450
proving that because we try to fulfill

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:21,310
everyone's needs we end up having a lot

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,270
of complexity yeah and on that note

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,160
while we were exploring this like we

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,680
kind of landed on the idea of frameworks

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,620
to and just the idea that frameworks are

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,890
so I men to be specific I'm talking

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,820
about things like Symphony framework

00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,400
probably also to a certain extent

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,750
front-end frameworks but tough to say

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,550
let's we can probably just keep it to

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:45,020
PHP frameworks just for the sake of this

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:46,490
discussion but like frameworks are quite

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,040
different from CMS's like you would

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,260
often have something like a content

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,580
editor but typically there's not someone

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,800
who's like a site builder who's like

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,990
rearranging the whole site it's that's

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,430
usually hard-coded into a template

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,640
because you're building like a custom

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,930
application or something that's pretty

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,490
much from the ground up and you're just

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,980
getting help you have that framework to

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,030
help you one of the things that I've

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,560
kind of noticed over the years is that

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,180
not to not to knock them or anything but

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,070
like sometimes people that are coming

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,540
from the symphony community kind of look

00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,890
at what we're doing with twig and say

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,570
like you're doing it wrong like what are

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,940
you doing like that's not how you use

00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,950
twig but it's a it's a totally different

00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,650
context right like twig is just a tool

00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:30,440
so the fact that we are a CMS the fact

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,450
that we have site builders I think has

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,050
to change how we use things like twig at

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,940
least to a certain degree so that's

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,900
that's just kind of what when my thought

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,910
is on that anyway

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,070
and the other kind of interesting point

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,710
to is that frameworks don't typically

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,030
come with a lot of templates and styling

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,430
like they might have like a really bare

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,870
bones thing but like you know Drupal and

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,540
WordPress and stuff like they come with

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:56,960
like themes and templates and CSS and

00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,430
that can be kind of off-putting to

00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,990
someone who will actually wants to build

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,730
in the framework way and start from

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,740
nothing like that's kind of the dream of

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,870
a lot of drupal theme errs is like I

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,150
don't give me any markup like I want to

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,010
specify every line of markup but that

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:17,390
becomes really hard when you have site

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:20,150
builders so just let's point out fee of

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,130
the specific examples of a complex use

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,510
cases in Drupal core which could be

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,270
simplified if you would just simply

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,730
leave out some of the user personas so

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,280
let's practice with the logo so how logo

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:34,010
works right now is that you upload a

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,800
logo into your team settings under

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,860
appearances section of the admin

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,530
interface in order to show it on the

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,470
page you have to have a region in your

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,750
team you have to output in a template

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:51,110
that region and you have to place a

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,090
block on that region so that's how logo

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,400
which is the most simplest thing you can

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,580
think of on the side it's been being

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,950
input in in Drupal so that's quite a lot

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,940
of complexity for a very very small

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,530
thing if you would say okay fee a low if

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,040
we accept the fact that site builders

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:12,050
are not able to modify a logo we could

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,030
simply just add the logo in the template

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,280
which is what many other systems are

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,620
doing and that will make order order

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,260
edge cases very simpler let's say if you

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,760
need to localize your logo or if you

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,200
need to translate it or if there is

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,420
something more complex happening with

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,430
the logo because right now it's prepared

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,080
for the base use case it's complex and

00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,760
if you want to add these new features

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,160
it's going to become even more complex

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,080
and this is again like what are the

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,530
personas that we are building Drupal to

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:44,690
who do we want to help with these

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:46,850
features and also the problem again is

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,410
that you can you can do this in a

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,600
template if you want to but it will

00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,750
break the UI which is kind of limiting

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,670
for some use cases because you can read

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,400
do it in an installation profile or a

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,710
module or a team so again it depends

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,320
what is your context well how are you

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:06,010
using Drupal what how can you how can

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,680
you do this feature another a little bit

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:11,350
more complex example its forms which

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,640
clearly illustrates like how are we

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,270
making this decision who are

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,280
reprioritizing so forms are there pew

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,010
markup they are nothing to do with the

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,380
back end but the back end developers has

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:25,210
to fall out really over forms and what

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,340
is what is going to be printed what kind

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,830
of markup is going to be outputted for

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,360
the forms it is great for the back end

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,160
developers it is great for the site

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,710
builders because of their is very well

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,270
specified components in the back end

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,390
that they can simply just drag and drop

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,580
number you just have to have a blue code

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,010
that will tell which components are

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,680
going to be sure and wear but for the

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:50,350
team errs they don't have any authority

00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:54,910
over the forms they can modify the

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:57,550
mark-up of a form so that the main user

00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:00,340
of a form the or one of the main users

00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,250
of a form who is going to be in the form

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,080
in the end is not able to modify what

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,580
kind of marker is going to be output for

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,170
that and that was actually one of the

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,420
interesting differences that we saw

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,940
between different systems that many of

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,590
the order system simply just had a

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,520
hard-coded forms they didn't have

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:20,140
something as compasses form API also

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,840
another interesting point is that form

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,480
API is one of the things that there has

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,420
been discussion for a long time to renew

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,170
it but I haven't even heard a single

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:34,210
thing in that conversation about how can

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,890
we make forms more t-mobile it's about

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:42,280
all the other things about from api so

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:44,320
when someone is renewing form api if it

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,290
would have the different user personas

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,710
it might help them to think about that

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:56,260
specific feature from another

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:59,920
perspective than their own and yeah this

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:02,620
is basically what we wanted to show to

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:06,690
you today now we would like to ask you

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:10,360
to join the conversation

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:15,010
so we have some predefined questions

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:17,770
here the first one is does anyone have

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,390
any examples in order systems that that

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:22,660
you think are valuable like how are they

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,570
due up like you did does any other

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,350
system do anything like this today /

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:34,590
guys different user personas or do they

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:34,590
have they written down them well or yeah

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:44,260
hi I can you just say who you are please

00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,300
hi my name is Joe potete and I'm one of

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:50,730
the theme system maintained errs for

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:53,350
Drupal 8 all right yeah it was um so

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,940
panels has an interesting idea for the--

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,700
murs that I've that I've kind of grown

00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:01,540
to love I didn't see that first but they

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,000
have they have a builder which mostly

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,010
murs wouldn't really use most of the

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,290
time but they actually have a builder

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,790
that allows you to create your layout

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,150
and then you can put the stuff into the

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,740
layout and that's kind of nice for those

00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,660
people that are using mostly murs I

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,760
would assume wouldn't use that because

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,020
you want to give that control they want

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,900
to take that control away a little bit

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,160
because they're laying out the page so

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,690
what they do is you can actually provide

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,520
templates tiles that can be shown in

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,910
there and then it's more like a choice

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:37,360
and so that gives me as a themer the

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,680
opportunity to set the areas of the page

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,740
where I could put two different fields

00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,600
and then I'm probably going to come back

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,700
in as a femur and put those fields into

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,880
this those buckets but at least gives me

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,990
the opportunity to structure that page

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,260
and I really like that kind of thing

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,850
whereas in core we have the just here's

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,920
the drag-and-drop order that is going to

00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,210
come out at and then we spit it out on

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,600
the page in the order that the theme

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,850
built team builder did it's not out of

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,090
the different system it's inside of our

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:09,440
system and we have a we have a control

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:13,610
for that they can do that kind of thing

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,309
I like that one like I've used silver

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,450
strike for a long time and they do the

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:21,919
kind of same thing too is if I can

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:24,889
provide the the fields to effect if you

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,570
I the field values to the initial page

00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:28,279
template or the one that I'm laying out

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,919
then I can actually write the mark

00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,720
around it and I I know like that's kind

00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,070
of we're saying I was like I want to be

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,669
able to control the mark-up around those

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:42,529
values I just need the values and do

00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:45,409
with as I will so yeah and I'm sure

00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:47,299
there's well actually yeah I think yeah

00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:49,789
no I think that thinks I think that's I

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,379
think that's valuable and I think to me

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,940
that kind of comes back to what we were

00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:55,490
talking about with perhaps finer grain

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,470
personas where I think we've talked

00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,149
before in the community about kind of

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,529
somethi murs they just want to write

00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:02,419
everything in code they don't want to

00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:04,009
click where are the other people are

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:06,500
okay with ya click together a panel

00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:07,850
layout or whatever we're all like you're

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,340
saying like you're describing like add

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:13,490
the fields to the different panel pains

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,259
and then write your CSS so like perhaps

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,240
those are two different personas that we

00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:20,779
need to consider but yeah I think that's

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:25,220
that's worth considering at least I owe

00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:29,480
my name is chris webber drupal

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,240
enthusiast i really feel that you missed

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,519
a excellent educational opportunity by

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,899
not reviewing the craft CMS system

00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,779
because it is a system that ships with

00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:43,610
no theming layer it ships with no theme

00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:46,190
in fact that makes the base assumption

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,889
that as a site builder you'll want to

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,110
organize content you'll want to create

00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:53,480
content in the admin but you don't want

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,299
to have the system have any influence on

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,399
the active team and the API that they

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,259
provide it's very much one that you

00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,210
would expect when you're dealing with

00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:04,429
the content repositories so you want

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,620
right actual code to get lists of

00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,250
content instead of using vuze you would

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,710
write a one line or a two liner

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:13,640
to say from the content repository I

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:17,360
want this cut of the content and then

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,670
iterate over that loop to generate

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,130
things on page but the basic idea is

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,490
that you would be coding your theme

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,020
every time you do a project and perhaps

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:31,380
that is both its benefit and its

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,930
detriment but it'd be interesting to

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,600
look at how we look at personas in

00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,610
comparison to that perspective I added a

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,910
video to the notes where did a deep dive

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:46,740
about that awesome yeah thank you ayee

00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:50,880
do they provide examples of themes well

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:53,160
they have a demo and they basically have

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,950
the demo available for for you to take a

00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:02,640
look at how they would do that but when

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,190
it comes to other guidance like having a

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,630
theme repository or something like that

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,600
that's up to the different vendors and

00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,490
stuff so it sounds like you're saying

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,820
like instead of clicking a view together

00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,160
you would just write PHP is that correct

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,960
it's twig what's twig yes okay so it's

00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,000
like at way had to override twig to

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,640
create some craft specific API functions

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,870
in order to get access to the repository

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,580
but than that in kind of tweak

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,830
interesting that's very interesting

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,720
point because it makes me think again

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,020
how can we make this kind of decisions

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,660
because we would need to know why are we

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,700
creating this system to and who should

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,310
we be prioritizing like with the current

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,810
priorities that we seem to be having we

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,850
wouldn't be really able to do that

00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,130
because it would take out really away

00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,080
from the site builder instead of giving

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,510
it to the teamer because steamer is

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,670
right now the least priority that we

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:58,230
have on the system and unless when you

00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:00,390
click together a view that then

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:05,780
generates a twig template that you can

00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,780
go and edit because we can do things

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:21,070
mark hey so I'm a big fan of style guide

00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:24,840
driven development from the front end

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:27,419
side of things where you have a system

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,900
pattern lab as one really good example

00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:33,549
there's another new one called fractal

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,070
KSS node is another really good style

00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:39,490
guide system where it's empowering the

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:41,500
femur to think about how how would I

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,330
make a design work so it's kind of like

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,940
a design first rather than necessarily a

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,980
site builder first system putting

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,260
together and then coming up with the

00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,960
various components of how that all works

00:28:50,260 --> 00:29:00,070
and then breaking those down into

00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:03,309
individual chunks of the page and so it

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,870
I just wanted it maybe I was wanted to

00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:08,500
point out one other aspect of our theme

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:13,419
system is that it's not only driven by

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:17,500
site builders right now but right Drupal

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:19,960
superpower is content modeling right

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,120
we're super good at coming up with

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,890
relationships between different content

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,700
and allowing people to structure that

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,429
within our system our theme system is

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:34,000
very very tightly tied to those data

00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:37,840
models that we create our primary model

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,120
of outputting our theme is to start at

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,960
one piece of content typically a node

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,539
and build out from there to go down

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,610
through fields and then go out through

00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:51,429
blocks and there are some things like

00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:54,010
views and panels that have slightly

00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:56,620
different models but that's that's like

00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:59,740
a really important aspect right now to

00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:03,039
how our theming system works which is

00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,919
very different from like the femur layer

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,890
of that like when we're thinking about

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,940
how to implement a design the component

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:15,789
based approach to things

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:19,120
so dress kind of mentioned the whole

00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:21,279
component-based the immune system in the

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,440
keynote this morning but just kind of

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:27,490
wanted to note that that there may be

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:31,809
some ways to rich some gaps and enhance

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,149
things that by getting real components

00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,309
into our system we could empower

00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:39,009
front-end developers to be able to have

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:41,500
a component based approach to how you

00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:44,620
theme things but also components really

00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:48,610
map very well to how site builders think

00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,309
about putting together a page like I

00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:54,070
think it maps very well to say you know

00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:55,750
hey I want to here's the header I want

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,700
to put some chunks of things into the

00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,919
header like one particular component or

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:03,789
another component that works really well

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,259
versus right now it's it's we have so

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:07,059
many different areas to define those

00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:11,830
things whether it's on a view mode page

00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:14,350
or a views or a block page and a more

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:17,049
unified system based around components

00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:18,940
might help improve everybody's lives

00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,340
yeah the component point is very

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,220
interesting and we both agreed when we

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,320
were preparing this session that the

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,049
wall discussion around components it's

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,450
been as opened is it's going to help

00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:34,389
this a lot is going to make the team

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:37,809
system a lot better most likely but it's

00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:39,759
going to be a one-time reset and we

00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:46,990
might end up in the similar situation

00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:48,250
where we try to fit be a team the system

00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,110
for all this different kind of user

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,480
personas that we don't know and then

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,940
then we'll build then it will be bloated

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,440
again into something else than anybody

00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:03,779
what it was designed first yeah like it

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,399
in other words like it would be nice to

00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,360
may not like not that we want to hold

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,179
things up or anything but it would be

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,879
nice to maybe incorporate some of this

00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:16,409
discussion of and maybe to find some

00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:16,409
personas as part of that discussion

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,620
and we probably going to use some of the

00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:26,010
things that we created in Barcelona last

00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,380
fall as a base they are the different

00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,300
Deemer personas but I believe it would

00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,250
be useful if you could specify these

00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,170
things even for site builders and

00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:41,820
back-end developers even from the theme

00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:43,470
system perspective hi this is David so

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,630
the persona stuff is is really

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,280
interesting and we discussed this a lot

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,380
at mid camp and Mark who just spoke

00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,480
before me has a blog post discussing all

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,950
different kinds of things for personas

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,860
that we were discussing there and

00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,210
working on which is even a lot of it is

00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,420
more granular than what you guys are

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:03,140
discussing here but I think the biggest

00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:06,360
problem but I always see is trying to

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,700
understand in our theme system where the

00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,990
sort of separation of concerns is so

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,730
that tax on to some of what Mark was

00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,860
talking about as well but like the logo

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:17,040
is actually a really good example like

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,570
what owns the logo right it's not just

00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,790
what's producing the mark-up of what

00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,650
owns it is it part of the content is it

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,780
part of the site configuration is it

00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,670
owned by the theme and that's why we

00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,490
seem to get into these problems and

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,050
there's lots of things in a system or in

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,460
any site that are like that that we

00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,500
always encounter things like the menu

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,450
right like is the menu owned by the site

00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,730
configuration or is it owned by content

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,350
and like what can control it we can

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,790
figure out the menu that's usually the

00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,440
one thing that causes the biggest the

00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,940
problem because it's one it's the one

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,290
component to actually 10 change as

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,760
opposed to a lot of other things like

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,470
how often are you going to change the

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,880
mark-up for how like an image tag is

00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:54,060
produced it's still just an image tag

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,500
but menus can be unordered list they

00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,210
could be divs they could be other things

00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,450
so someone might want to like redesign

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,740
how that works but we always run it to

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,600
these issues where it's like all right

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,250
something produces that markup of what

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,310
should be producing that markup can we

00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:11,399
create clear lines of separation between

00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:14,129
the back end and the theme system and

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,210
the theme itself and the CSS and all

00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:17,129
that kind of stuff do you think we'd

00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:21,810
ever get the point where we actually can

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:24,139
do that yeah I don't know if we can

00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,190
really answer that but but I agree and

00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,129
menu is actually one of the ones that we

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:31,769
considered including but it's a little

00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:34,440
than like something like the logo so

00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:36,539
glad that you mention it yeah it was

00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,730
interesting to see that even a menu has

00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:42,029
so many different ways to be implemented

00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,289
in all these different systems and it

00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:47,579
was one of the things that we believe

00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:50,159
that we could easily so show that by

00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:51,659
defining user personas we want to build

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,879
a system we could probably make

00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,409
different kind of decisions that we

00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:01,710
might have made without the user

00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:06,150
personas I Chris Drupal nerd okay about

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:08,390
forms it that it's such a big enough

00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,670
problem that it sounds like it's its own

00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,769
separate need stone separate focus i

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:19,460
don't know you've looked at things like

00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:22,049
form I Oh Travis did well drupal ER

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,289
working performed a day okay oh it's

00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:28,190
another way of creating like a forum

00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:30,690
building experience works with ap is

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:37,769
just another suggestion and stuff in

00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:43,140
research yeah thank you hi Boyle you ax

00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:46,440
me Taylor do one thing I'd like to just

00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,849
throw out there as an ID so like in my

00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,559
professional job I work with a lot of

00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:54,000
clients where we do like persona

00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:55,819
projects and sometimes you know like a

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,410
couple month projects where we research

00:35:55,819 --> 00:36:01,140
like what their personas are for their

00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,940
products and then we try to help them

00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,609
out and actually using those personas

00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:08,880
and one of the things that we found

00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:11,369
works pretty well is what you actually

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,400
have defined like a set of personas like

00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:16,680
this case we would have three is

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,309
actually do exercises like scenarios

00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,680
where we say like in this scenario how

00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:24,530
would you apply these personas and which

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,730
things would prioritize how

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,990
because at the end of the day you're

00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,120
always going to have competing

00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,700
priorities and it's never going to be

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,290
like a gray or black and white or you

00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,720
can say like oh no we're going to do the

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:38,300
cycle of thing no you always have those

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,060
competing priorities and doing those

00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,970
scenario exercises it's also something

00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:47,150
you can then have as a like an example

00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,530
for when something similar comes up and

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,290
that's something that seems to work

00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:54,200
really well yeah thanks for that like I

00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,670
think we can really use your help like

00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
not not necessarily you specifically

00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,420
like definitely you specifically but

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,500
just UX in general and I have a question

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:05,090
for you though still run away so can you

00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,770
can you just describe that a little bit

00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,600
more that that exercise like are you

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,400
getting different people are you just

00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,410
kind of simulating in your head what

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,120
that persona would do like or are you

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:22,130
getting someone that fits that persona

00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:25,820
and asking them questions yeah okay but

00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:28,670
so I describe how that typically goes so

00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:32,450
for example for one client we have like

00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:35,720
this process of like two months where we

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:38,030
did like 40 interviews with four person

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,570
for basically archetypes that we that

00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,720
they thought what our customers and out

00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:47,480
of that you get the profile right of

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,000
what that person finds important like

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,320
what the ways of interacting with the

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,900
product and basically how that impacts

00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,280
like key parts of the product right like

00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:04,310
so how the team system should be in this

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,790
case like ideally positioned to cater to

00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:10,790
his or her meets the exercises then to

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,830
actually just have a scenario which in

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:16,970
this case could be anything like the

00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:20,540
component thing for example and to them

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,340
have the discussion ideally with like

00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,140
people that we represent that

00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,630
so in general that's like certain

00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:28,550
customers yep in our case that could

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,830
just be people that actually have that

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,870
role in any type of Drupal organization

00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,400
to kind of play that role and then to

00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:37,040
have that discussion with the people in

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,200
the room because of the most the biggest

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,870
part about personas is actually trying

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:48,440
to make the arguments of a server so no

00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:51,380
more life cool thanks I have that's very

00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,730
helpful probably related question before

00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:57,440
that so so in the context of Drupal ah

00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,390
how should we prioritize the different

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,030
user personas should it be always the

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:05,900
same user persona or like how should

00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:08,090
this kind of decision making happen so

00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,270
so generally it's a top-down process

00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:13,130
right we're from the top someone decides

00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,920
that this is the persona its most

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,560
important for a product right now with

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,150
the vision that was laid out for example

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,010
this this morning but to be honest of

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:27,680
the last like 10 years yeah I think

00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:29,540
there's some some obvious personas but

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,370
what we really haven't done quite well

00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,170
yet is actually filling the performance

00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,080
just figure out like what are actually

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:38,390
the behaviors that these people do and

00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:43,270
what are their preferences and things

00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,270
that they don't like that would be

00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:51,309
cool and kind of one question that I

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,819
want to throw out there just is like to

00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:57,400
me is it is it possible to make all

00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:58,779
these people happy or do we need to kind

00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,549
of give someone the short end of the

00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:06,029
stick like that that's just kind of

00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:08,259
might be a hypothetical question but and

00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:15,819
does it have to be the theme ur always

00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:17,170
yes yeah just to that I think it's it's

00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:19,269
always been an issue that just because

00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,549
you have priorities doesn't mean that

00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:23,440
everything goes to the top priority

00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:25,210
right it's I mean you have to consider

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,039
them the most but it is possible to

00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,079
spread the love a little bit i think you

00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,589
know something a priority that's the

00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:34,589
last priority is still a priority it's

00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:38,440
just not the top right hard right yeah

00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:40,869
so I think I think maybe sometimes you

00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,640
can make small sacrifices for your top

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:44,940
priority in order to have some bigger

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,940
wins

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,960
right so try and spread it out a little

00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,640
bit more yeah he also right now because

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,619
we don't have that well specified

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,349
personas obviously we don't have a

00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:59,540
decision making process happening on

00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,960
these things like woe is going to lose

00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:06,349
in this and we're going to win in this

00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,839
so having the more fine-grained user

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:14,510
personas might help us to think about

00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:16,490
specific users that we have yeah go mark

00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,750
Fullmer I'm a back-end drupal developer

00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:21,200
and I think this is a really interesting

00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:23,960
conversation because it applies to a

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,070
specific instance of commerce because I

00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,099
think a lot of what we're talking about

00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,780
here is forms single pages usually they

00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:31,369
might have JavaScript but I'm in

00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,690
commerce there's oftentimes multiple

00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:34,070
pages that you have to move through and

00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,960
it's not just a question of what should

00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,000
it look like but in what order should

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,290
things happen and what should be the

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,630
feedback given and so I think that

00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:44,300
that's a particular challenge between

00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:46,520
back end design front-end design and

00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,040
even the UX there so I don't know what

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,750
the answer is but it's a challenge yeah

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,820
for sure so i guess and with the way

00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,440
you're saying as well is that you want

00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,210
some flexibility for someone to be able

00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,770
to kind of move steps around and stuff

00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,849
like that right is that part of it or

00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:03,920
okay yeah i guess the site builder there

00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:08,690
could be able to have a role here yeah

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:12,440
okay cool thanks here I just wanted to

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:15,410
sort of follow up on who are you I'm 2

00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,050
vs T stickler also a Drupal core

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:21,500
developer and mostly I guess back-end

00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:23,630
developer yeah just to sort of follow up

00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,990
on the sort of conflicting interests of

00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:28,400
the different of the different personas

00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:31,609
basically expanding are we what you said

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,550
lowry i think actually if we do get to

00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:36,880
the point where we actually have to find

00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:39,260
or have actually like made that decision

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,000
what we want to allow and what we want

00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,099
to sort of like what we want to be as a

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,940
product and what we want to support what

00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:47,839
kind of personas we want to cater for

00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,670
obviously we will never like make

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,720
everyone one hundred percent happy but I

00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,530
do think we can

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,930
achieve like we can actually make whole

00:42:54,530 --> 00:43:00,680
people reasonably happy like just just

00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:02,840
to go into that example where you have

00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,760
like the manage fields a page where you

00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,170
can order your drag around your fields

00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,140
and then have like a femur just override

00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:10,670
it completely if we wanted to actually

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,099
support that we could totally like

00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:16,190
building a flag that in the UI then

00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:18,800
shows the person like instead of showing

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,180
the table just says like this doesn't

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,520
exist because the theme is overriding

00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,780
this page but on the other hand if we

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,369
don't want to support that we could also

00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:30,440
like somehow discourage the theme or

00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:34,640
explicitly in some way because I you

00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,200
know it's not always that you know it's

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,140
not always like the evil themer that's

00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,730
trying to like destroy the site builders

00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,500
life but it's also just like someone

00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,720
seeing a template seeing a note object

00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,040
and just playing around with it so you

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,140
know I think if we can actually like

00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,599
clearly define where we want to be and

00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,330
we're going to go I think we can just

00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,770
enhance our tools and our toolkit and

00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:59,330
actually make everyone at least

00:43:54,770 --> 00:44:02,570
reasonably happy I agree with that and I

00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:05,869
think in the process of making decisions

00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:08,089
it would be wise to have the user

00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:10,430
personas so you could make the decisions

00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:12,109
based on the user sort of the user

00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:16,490
personas that makes the most effect

00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:20,770
would be happy yeah and like bigger

00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:23,240
effect on teamer might be bigger

00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:25,700
affecting the total happiness than

00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:30,830
having a small happiness effect for the

00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:34,160
back end developers I'm just I'm xjm on

00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:36,020
a Drupal 8 release manager the part of

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,570
the past couple of questions that I find

00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,119
interesting and that I'm under stood in

00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:44,420
how we would solve is how we how we

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,130
actually implement taking if we if we

00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,150
find these personas how we actually make

00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:50,000
sure that they are a part of the

00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:54,380
decisions that we make and so I think

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,690
the the current point the place that

00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,910
we're starting to try to do that in in

00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:02,869
core is in our core governance

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:05,960
process we have a design designated flow

00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:09,200
where if a change requires a significant

00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,849
change for X then someone who's

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,799
responsible for maintaining that is

00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:14,990
needs to sign off on it before you make

00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:16,789
that change so for minor changes that

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:19,220
that don't have significant impact on

00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:22,329
anything that isn't required but for

00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:26,660
example if something has introduces new

00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:29,390
new user interface patterns than the we

00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,579
kind of the site builder persona persona

00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,530
as if it's multiple personas we kind of

00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:35,359
lump that under like there would be a

00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,329
usability sign off that was required to

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,369
make sure that the site builders use

00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:42,740
case was met and then a combination of

00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:45,440
that and with a particular subsystem the

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,670
part of the site builders like a part of

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,440
a site builder interaction that that

00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,910
subsystem is responsible for providing

00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,740
would also need to sign off on it so

00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,390
it's like sort of like a domain of two

00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,160
separate responsibilities having that

00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:58,789
list to refer to be really interesting

00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,039
and I think we also aside from if it

00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:04,640
will significantly affect the theme

00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:07,640
system we don't really have any point of

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,440
sign off for if it what would be the

00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,049
theming personas there so that's

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,299
interesting and I'm not I'm not sure at

00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:16,640
what points like at what point in issues

00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:19,970
it is it every single every single issue

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,650
that affects Markov period or every

00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,779
issue that affects the way markup is

00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:26,000
built the form API is a great example of

00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:28,130
like that absolutely has to be something

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
that all all of the different concerns

00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:35,599
like are reflected and if we change that

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,940
but in smaller issues it like at what

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,109
point do are we missing the boat when we

00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,579
make decisions and that's only for the

00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:44,299
chorus uq obviously doesn't even apply

00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:45,980
to the whole contribute consistent yeah

00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:48,410
i think that's really valuable and kind

00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,329
of one of the one of the questions that

00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,760
we put down is kind of like who decides

00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:54,829
and also like do we always need to

00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,210
prioritize so it's yeah i think that

00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:59,020
those are really relevant and something

00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:02,809
that we need to think about i guess my

00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,490
initial opinion is that things like like

00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:07,190
maybe minor markup changes and things

00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:09,170
like that like it would be good too can

00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:11,270
you know consult the mark-up maintain or

00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,880
kind of thing but we probably don't need

00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,009
to bust

00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,710
the big like manual of personas for

00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:18,869
something like that prop yeah that that

00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,210
person yes but but i think the whims

00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:23,430
component issue is a great example of a

00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,769
shoe or research really consider what

00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:29,759
are why are we building this far because

00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:32,069
it has a huge effect on the on all of

00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:33,869
these different user personas i forgot

00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:36,559
to clarify something which is that right

00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:39,150
now the process for this actually is

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,220
have scott commit the patch because

00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,450
that's the way we've self elven so so

00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,759
right right now as a core committer

00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:46,650
scott is kind of filling the absent role

00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:50,029
of the mark-up maintainer sign off so to

00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:52,500
some extent but it's it's not really a

00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:54,059
sustainable strategy to pin all of the

00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,009
hopes for the future of solving all of

00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:59,039
course problems on only on the fact that

00:47:56,009 --> 00:48:00,720
scott will catch us also agree I don't

00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,180
have anything against Scott i love scott

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,190
I be honest that that decision making

00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,470
process is based on Scott's priorities

00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,920
in his head instead of the priorities

00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:14,720
and user personas that we might come up

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,940
with a larger audience yeah like I think

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,230
you know given that i am that that's

00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,759
that's a good way to put it cuz yeah i

00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,950
am i am kind of filling that role right

00:48:20,759 --> 00:48:24,420
now and there's there's definitely cases

00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,880
where i would probably be really happy

00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:29,670
to be able to consult the old manual of

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:34,950
user personas to be able to think about

00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:40,319
things a little differently so the first

00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:46,259
time I who are you I'm Cathy I'm the SCT

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:49,019
I worked on court I guess and the first

00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:51,450
time I heard about personas was maybe at

00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:55,500
like a year and a half ago when I was

00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:59,279
part of the drupal.org software working

00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:02,180
group and we did an exercise to think

00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:05,160
about like a prioritization for

00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:07,799
drupal.org changes and for a while that

00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,369
group did the prioritization it's a

00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:13,590
little different right now but it seems

00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:15,810
like then that

00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:19,950
other people in the room we're familiar

00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:23,280
with the process of making personas and

00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:26,370
doing prioritization and it was new to

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,200
me because that's not my job because I

00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:32,490
was just you know working on core issues

00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,960
and I had no idea so if I was one of the

00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:37,650
last people in the room to know what a

00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:41,360
year and a half ago why are we not

00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:45,120
already using it in court like what is

00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:47,940
what has changed now right like why

00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:51,330
didn't this happen a while ago what what

00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:53,460
happened now that that we're really

00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:56,970
thinking about putting this in place

00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,680
well I think to me anyway Laura you can

00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:02,730
feel free to disagree but for me anyway

00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:05,310
part of it is that I don't feel like

00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:08,790
this is not my domain of expertise like

00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:11,130
you x let's say let's call you x like I

00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:13,590
can use the words and I can sort of talk

00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:21,150
about it but I don't really oh cool we

00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:22,710
got a software update you know I can

00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,450
throw around terms like personas but

00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,190
I've never done like one of those

00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:29,040
exercises that you're talking about so

00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,630
it's kind of an abstract concept to me

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,590
so I'm like you know when we were

00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:35,970
putting this together we we didn't

00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,530
really know that we were going to be

00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,060
talking about personas but as we were

00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,680
kind of exploring this we're like okay

00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,590
like we were basically trying to like

00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:47,210
fix the theme system like that's kind of

00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:49,950
the lofty goal of this core conversation

00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:52,620
so it just seemed like it could be a

00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:55,260
useful tool but I don't I don't really

00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,570
know how to use it so I think if we can

00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,940
get people to kind of teach us like like

00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:03,150
you've probably got taught then I think

00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:07,260
that would be good that's David again so

00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:09,900
my opinion it necessarily prove it but I

00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,690
suspect that some of what why this

00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,600
persona stuff started coming up has been

00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:17,530
doing way there's the community has

00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,160
changed slightly in

00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:22,450
who's doing contributions I think it was

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,750
years and years ago it was so much more

00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:28,180
back and not just focused but because it

00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,740
was largely back in developers that they

00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,570
didn't think about the personas as much

00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:34,180
and that there's there are a lot more

00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:36,160
voices i think has involved like the

00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,070
theme the twig team is much larger than

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,800
it is now and has a much larger voice

00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:43,120
then has now previously so there's a lot

00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,400
more people saying like oh there are all

00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,830
these different persona types and we

00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,300
should think about like what's affecting

00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,280
these front end people and the site

00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,900
builder people and he's back end people

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,850
because of the voices that are actually

00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:58,780
there now as opposed to what was there

00:51:54,850 --> 00:52:00,790
before yeah I think that's a really good

00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,040
point and I think that kind of the whole

00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:05,110
kind of front-end United idea that you

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,060
know we're bringing together like the

00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,560
front end and theme errs and the UX and

00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:12,310
stuff like that like I think that is

00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,720
partially at least explains that because

00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,640
I've definitely had more exposure to

00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:21,220
those ideas just by kind of being in

00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:23,710
that cluster people so i can add also

00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:26,050
live with history so i've been semi

00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:28,570
involved in like drupal 6 and quite

00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:31,030
involved in equal 7 and it seems to be

00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:32,200
that at the beginning of the cycle we

00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,090
always go like oh we need our

00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,060
fundamental tools to make decisions

00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:39,730
better then once we start running we go

00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:42,250
like no we were running we don't have

00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:44,740
time to like do all of these steps that

00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:49,300
are part of general product management

00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:50,860
type activities but i think what's

00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,360
different now is we're gonna have that

00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,560
psycho every six months like at the

00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,020
beginning of those six months we're

00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,090
going to have those questions and i feel

00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:01,150
like now is a better time to start doing

00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:03,099
that because yeah we're going to need

00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,569
all the time every six months we're

00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:06,730
gonna have these discussions like why

00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:13,869
are we now prioritizing guess old for

00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:16,539
that well that's that's an awesome point

00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:20,079
thank you so it's a combination of on

00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:26,109
purpose prioritizing kids and an effort

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:28,390
to work smarter as a community right

00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:30,970
because I think a lot of the time that

00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:32,260
we spent in the last couple years was

00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:34,529
figuring out like how we use our

00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,750
resources appropriately and

00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:39,520
prioritization turns out to

00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:42,039
communicating priorities turns out to be

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,510
one of those nice ways so maybe since

00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:45,250
we've been trying to communicate

00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,869
priorities now we're like maybe we

00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,930
should figure out how to figure out what

00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:53,589
the priorities are and because there are

00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:59,799
a lot more different voices involved

00:53:53,589 --> 00:54:03,869
there's a lot more conflict and extreme

00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:06,309
differences of opinions and in a

00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:10,170
traditional Drupal way we might be

00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:13,510
trying to figure out like a process and

00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:16,119
to do things like politely and fairly

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:19,630
and objectively and not personally and

00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:23,470
so perhaps these personas are coming as

00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:28,240
a way to solve this desire that we have

00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:29,710
not to have personal conflict yeah like

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,220
I kind of really like the idea of

00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:35,890
actually having real people to you know

00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:37,750
arm hopefully multiple people for like

00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,099
these hypothetical personas that we

00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,029
would come up with like kind of like boy

00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:42,549
yen was saying where we could actually

00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:44,230
be like in this situation like what

00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:48,369
would you want what would you do and

00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:50,200
things like that so i think that's

00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:52,420
that's probably pretty good unless

00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:56,670
anyone has anything else i don't know if

00:54:52,420 --> 00:55:00,309
there's a session after this is that

00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:02,020
sorry if you have any interest in

00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:04,480
contributing to discussion of what

00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:06,849
processes we should use for how we make

00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,010
decisions in minor releases you should

00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:10,390
stay in this room and Oh awesome session
