Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Building your DevOps gameplan
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Are you feeling the pain and chaos of web development and want to bring the promise of DevOps to your organization?  This session is for anyone that wants to be an agent for change within their organization.

Whether you are a developer or a sysadmin or a business owner, it's easy to tell when things aren't quite right in your development lifecycle, and a lot harder to figure out how to get things on track.  There is lot's of good content on tools and technology to help streamline your development and operations, but technology alone isn't enough to change your organization for the better.  In this session, we'll look at creating a devops gameplan for your organziation by addressing the systems, beliefs, and behaviors that are holding you back. 

Some of the topics we'll dig into include:

Using the Toyota Kata to build and communicate a plan for change
Providing visibility into the current state to communicate the problems
Identifying and shifting the beliefs that are holding back your team
Determining when technology and tools are worth investing in, and when it's not the limiting factor
Gaining momentum through small wins
Be the DevOps you want to see in the world.

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,620
the love so we're going to dig in a

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,170
little bit about how you can bring about

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,180
a change to the organization or the team

00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:00,210
or the group that you're working in and

00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,850
get into DevOps a little bit so we'll

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,830
just do some quick kind of like hand

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,500
raising two to work it out a little bit

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,450
so how many people here like feel like

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,479
they know what DevOps is and are excited

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,650
about it yeah maybe a bunch of people

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,210
cool let's talk a little bit about like

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,189
the organization size that we work with

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,869
so who works in an organization like

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:30,750
under 50 people not anymore call what

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:34,220
about under I'm not sure 300 people okay

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,780
what about under like a thousand people

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,720
yeah so pretty good pretty good

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,909
distribution my background is mostly

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,880
kind of it smaller companies startups

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,399
and kind of mid-sized tech firms but

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,750
hopefully what what we get into today

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,280
will be applicable across the board so

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,310
I'll tell you a little bit about myself

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,229
so my name is Nick steel ow I do

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,680
engineering at Pantheon as one of the

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,399
first handful of hires there so if you

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,140
if you're using Pantheon at all which I

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,060
would recommend you're probably using

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,250
some you know some software system that

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,350
I built if you're using Pantheon and

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,080
it's working really well you're our most

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,840
certainly using some software which an

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,490
engineer that's on the team now gutted

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,390
out all my code and replaced it with

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,940
much better working code I'm at and

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,560
steal our on Twitter and stuff and I'm a

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,350
believer but i think i've been to say

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,690
believer but i'm a but i'm a believer to

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,270
a justin bieber believer I think he's

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,970
like the most kind of dev ops ii of like

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,780
the teenage you know entertainer kind of

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,690
you know train wrecks but you know I'm a

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,760
believer I'm a believer that there's a

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,270
better way to do things I'm a believer

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,330
in dev ops I'm a believer in teams I'm a

00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,490
believer in collaboration and I'm also

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,120
believer that you should ditch work if

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:07,710
there's a really good powder day like it

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,720
was this day so here here's some

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,400
recommended hashtags I mean I can't like

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,290
you know tell you exactly what hashtags

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,370
to use but like this like if you are if

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,950
you happen to be tweeting about this

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,080
session there might there might be some

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:24,000
good good ones here beliebers for DevOps

00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,120
49 ohms I think that's that's my

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,160
allotted budget of ohms for this talk so

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,050
i think i have about forty six left if

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,890
anybody wants to count there they're

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,660
more than welcome welcome to you so this

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,920
is the introduction unfortunately anyone

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,930
who wanted to go faster we're going to

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,080
start start the beginning or at least

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,200
where i think the beginning is so the

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,700
TLDR is basically DevOps is awesome and

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,820
you should believe in it but we're going

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:57,090
to get into it from the beginning so who

00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,090
is this talk for this talk is for anyone

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,890
this talk is for everyone this talk is

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,870
for people who believe that there's a

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,690
better way to do things whether you're a

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,540
project manager or an engineer or a CEO

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,960
or or a custodian or kind of whatever

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,940
your title is this talk is for people

00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,770
who want to be agents for change within

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,250
the organization in groups and teams

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:23,140
that there

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:26,410
working for I want to believe I am a

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,450
believer and if you guys don't believe

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,600
that there's a better way to do things I

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,800
don't know how much I can help you if

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,870
you really don't believe there's a

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,420
better way to do things I think there's

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:41,670
a session next door on why we should

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:44,170
keep Drupal 6 forever and ever and ever

00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:49,060
it might be more applicable to you at

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:50,710
this stage there's not but there's going

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,570
to be a good wake kind of funeral for

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:58,360
Drupal 6 on thursday i'm catching wind

00:04:52,570 --> 00:05:00,400
of so might try to hit that up so change

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,620
agent I kind of like that word it sounds

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,660
kind of badass and it also kind of makes

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,440
it sound hard and it is a little hard I

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,419
found this diagram which is um which you

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,820
it's like your own DevOps kind of change

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:15,580
agent superhero and you get to fill in

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,640
fill in what you're super devops

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,110
superhero kind of some of the things

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,580
they might have in their utility belt

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,990
and while you're doing this you can kind

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,820
of think about what's in your you know

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,740
what's in your DevOps tool tool belt

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,710
that you want that you think will help

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:34,030
you bring change to the table so in this

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:36,370
case you know our DevOps superhero has a

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,770
burrito because DevOps is hard work and

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,190
you might get a little hungry so you

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,720
might need that burrito they're kind of

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,070
an open hand to make sure your kind of

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,440
reaching across the aisle meeting new

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,530
people giving high-fives and celebrating

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,960
your wins a fanny pack full of gifts

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,750
because sometimes if you can't say what

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,330
you really need to say in a gif or a

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:03,370
meme you know maybe it just can't be set

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,660
at all and you know smile to make sure

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,620
you're having fun positive mental

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,550
attitude to approach the approach the

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,070
organizational problems you're looking

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,260
at so your DevOps superhero probably

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,040
looks a little different than this but

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,080
you know I think you can't be thinking

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,780
about what what you have and you know

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,310
what your teammates have and what you

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,180
think will be necessary within the

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,710
context of your organization to to kind

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,790
of make some of that better way that you

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:35,370
believe in

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:37,540
reality so why why should we dev up

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,980
you'll see I kind of make fun of the

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,980
word dev up and I would encourage

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,990
everyone else to as well a little bit

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,920
turn it into a verb and different things

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,060
like that but why should we Deb right um

00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,520
so this might be something that you kind

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,960
of are tackling late at night as you

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,550
can't sleep and you're wondering what

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,320
the meaning of life and you know how

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,360
you're going to move forward and and we

00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,860
know what you were put here to do this

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,180
might be something you encounter as you

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,960
kind of start to have some of these

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,880
conversations within your organization a

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,080
little resistance to change and you can

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,990
have you know there are a ton of

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,970
different valid answers for this one

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,370
being like dude because DevOps is

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,050
awesome and that might be applicable to

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,560
your situation or something that you

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,540
believe in or more of the jesse robin

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,390
style operations is a competitive

00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,610
advantage and we want to crush our

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,880
competitors it might be a little more

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,200
refined something like well doing a

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,720
value stream analysis we've identified a

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:40,660
couple wastes applying this the system

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,840
of the seven lean wastes and we want to

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,240
improve the cycle time and delivery time

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,710
of our products so you can come at this

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,510
from a lot of different directions but

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,980
the nice thing that we all have in our

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:56,140
back pocket is that if we don't change

00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,540
ultimately we're all going to be beat

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,540
out by people who are changing in

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,530
organizations who are changing and so

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,050
that's kind of a nice thing to know

00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,200
ultimately the people who are resisting

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:12,880
change will will find that change one

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,290
way or another so we had a couple hand

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,790
raised about people thought they you

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,650
know had a good handle on dev ops but

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,350
you know not everyone in the room so

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,920
wanted to go into what exactly is DevOps

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,880
so these are a couple kind of marketing

00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:31,090
infographics included including one from

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:33,400
Pantheon about what DevOps is and none

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,380
of these really make sense to me so the

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,460
guy on the left has this really weird

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,980
stance and

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,290
he's kind of half and half the people on

00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,720
the bottom don't have eyes and not like

00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,400
that totally precludes DevOps but i just

00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,580
don't really understand what's going on

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,350
there I think the photo on top they seem

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,970
to be having fun which i think is a big

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,040
part of it so they're probably like that

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,030
kind of resonates with me and then

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,980
there's you know the unicorn and and

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,570
kind of pantheons over there so I think

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,980
there's all valid stuff here but none of

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,330
these kind of reach out and grab me and

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:15,430
like our are the DevOps that I believe

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:17,200
in so then we can say all right well

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,400
what isn't dead lops maybe this is an

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,090
easier easier way to approach the

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,190
problem so this is like the docker

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,870
github repo right so DevOps isn't a

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,670
single tool like you can't install

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,220
DevOps you can't like get cloned and

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,160
like run DevOps right it's not about the

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,800
tools you know this is a job description

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,140
or this is um this is like from another

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,820
marketing website I Love New Relic but

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,890
this but it's kind of easy to make fun

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,930
of so these are their tools for DevOps

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,430
and this page just keeps going down and

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,460
down and down it's like every piece of

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,200
software out there everything is a tool

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,370
for DevOps and so maybe that's true but

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,080
I don't think we need a website for it

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,340
you know in a DevOps isn't uh isn't a

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,760
role you can't just kind of higher

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,860
DevOps and make it happen although

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,120
you'll see a lot of these and if you

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,530
really feel like that's the best title

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,920
for someone that you're hiring or in

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,270
your org you know go for it but none of

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,620
these things really to me our DevOps

00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:16,560
either so we really need to pin it down

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,470
and kind of put a definition on this

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,140
I'll ike this definition from Adam Jacob

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,570
who works it chef he's a really good

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,030
hugger and he's also put a lot of

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,190
thought into dev ops and what that means

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,130
and I'm kind of wordsmith this pretty

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,690
well there's kind of a link on the

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,610
bottom chef has a bunch of good content

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,190
that actually does ring pretty pretty

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,279
true to me so if you're looking for more

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,920
info look

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,430
kind of some of chefs devops kung fu and

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,379
and other content but this definition is

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,470
that DevOps is a cultural and

00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:53,199
professional movement focused on how we

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,850
build operate build and operate

00:10:53,199 --> 00:11:00,290
high-velocity organizations born from

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,240
the experiences of its practitioners so

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,009
I like I like this definition it

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,259
actually kind of works for me and I

00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:08,120
think the most the key piece that I like

00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:10,430
from this definition is the word

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,069
movement you know and I think DevOps is

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,100
about movement it's about the movement

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:18,230
of value from real from ideation to

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,480
realization it's about the movement of

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,420
organizational culture and norms from

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,269
the status quo to the nuvo it's about

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,350
the movement of diffs and bits moving

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:32,470
out from dev to test alive to customers

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:40,209
ladies and gentlemen DevOps is about

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:40,209
movement yeah that's it for the slide

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,569
but you know this is like more kind of

00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,959
have to like embrace this the paradox of

00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:51,920
duality here dev and ops and dev and ops

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:56,029
and DevOps in the words of Zen master

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,069
suzuki they are one and yet not one and

00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:59,899
I think if you spend enough time in

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,459
DevOps you like you might hear some

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,290
people kind of get philosophical a

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:06,279
little bit I tend to do that so you can

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,920
kind of get me back online but I think

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,839
you know so suzuki talks about what it

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,910
must feel like as a bit of water that's

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,309
in a stream and then the stream launches

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,139
over a waterfall and then it turns into

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,720
these millions of little drops of water

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,490
and then they reunite all again at the

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,949
bottom when the water hits the river

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,569
again and if you stare this problem in

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:30,800
the face long enough you might start to

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:34,339
look like this guy but you know this is

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,220
this is a hard hard thing hard thing to

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:41,269
do and even a even a hard thing to kind

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:45,439
of think about sometimes but it's

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:47,720
essential to DevOps that DevOps is never

00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,389
done I like this quote from Damien

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,829
Edwards another gentleman who's kind of

00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,730
spent a lot of time thinking about this

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,889
and working with organ

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,720
sations banished done from your

00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:59,269
vocabulary you're never done you're

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,060
never done with DevOps just like

00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:05,060
sisyphus was never done pushing this big

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,089
ball up the hill over and over again

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,730
this big ball of DevOps and I pretty

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,920
sure the part of the reason you guys are

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,899
in this room guys and gals are in this

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,459
room is that your believers there's a

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,709
better way to do things and you're ready

00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,690
to take on the challenge in one form of

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:23,019
another of bringing some positive change

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,579
to your organization and your teams and

00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,889
so you've already taken the first step

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:30,889
but this will be lots of work to roll

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:33,589
this ball of DevOps uphill against all

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:35,209
of the organizational the kind of the

00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,730
status quo and the friction and the

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:42,380
questions but I think that's why we're

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:46,399
all here Razoo French philosopher Albert

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,230
Albert Camus who did a treatise on the

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,149
absurd when he was trying to wrap

00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,600
wrangle his head around some of these

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:55,790
DevOps questions and he came to the

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,699
conclusion that absolutely the only way

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,699
it works is that Sisyphus was happy he

00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:04,550
was delighted to have this obligation to

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:08,180
roll this ball a Miss rock up the hill

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:10,310
again and again and so I think like that

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,639
happy Sisyphus if you guys are looking

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,050
to bring about change you're going to

00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,850
need it kind of find your own Zen and

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,980
your own reason why these challenges are

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,720
the right challenges to be fighting and

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:26,600
bring that energy to the table every day

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,149
so how does one develop we went over

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,480
that we can't hire it and we can't buy

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:35,329
it and we can't install it so all that's

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,970
really left is just to do DevOps and the

00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:40,699
good thing is that the only thing you

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:45,139
need to start doing DevOps is just to

00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:47,660
start doing DevOps and you're like okay

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,699
okay but really tell me you know we came

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,160
here to get some actionable stuff so I

00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:54,139
think that's probably the end of some of

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,720
the philosophical DevOps tough but I

00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:58,720
can't guarantee it it might pop up again

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,170
so now we're going to kind of get now

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,370
with that out of the way I going to get

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,790
a little bit more in

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:12,110
the meat of the of the duck so building

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:14,740
your dev ops game plan so here's this

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,950
triumvirate of a kind of aspects of life

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:22,670
beliefs and behaviors and systems and

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:26,570
these govern a lot of the actions we

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:29,450
take day-to-day on how we interact with

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,610
other people even kind of the way we

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,790
feel when we're doing our job or going

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:37,850
about our lives and these all are

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:42,200
essential to building your dev ops game

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:44,390
plan if you master not one but all three

00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,660
of these you will be on your way to

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:53,650
DevOps enlightenment and we're going to

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:57,200
dig in a bit of double animation solid

00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,670
and so beliefs and behaviors and systems

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,860
are all kind of interrelated and

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,630
interdependent I kind of came up with

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,720
this one kind of set of relationships

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,920
but I think a lot of these are there's

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,790
all kind of a lot of different ways you

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,410
could frame the relationships between

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,089
these you know kind of the beliefs we

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,920
have and form the behaviors and that

00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,020
actions we take every day those

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,850
behaviors can get encoded in systems and

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,700
kind of automated and systematized and

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:25,160
then those systems reinforce the beliefs

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,890
that we had to be there we had the

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,290
beginning and if you're not when you're

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,959
trying to approach organizational change

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,760
if you're not able to do that if you're

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,980
not able to change each of these you're

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,130
not going to be successful and a lot of

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,980
the so excited about that DevOps track

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:46,190
this year I think there's a ton of great

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,350
content but you know I think in general

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,410
a bunch of the content kind of focuses

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,550
more on the systems and the tools and so

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,170
I'm helping to kind of round that out

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,900
and make sure we kind of understand some

00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:03,170
of these other factors that are critical

00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:06,490
and achieving DevOps success of course

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:10,610
Gandhi you know God need nailed DevOps

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,230
with this code when he's you know

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,819
talking about the interconnectedness of

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,310
these different aspects beliefs

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,520
behaviors and systems where your beliefs

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,589
become your thoughts

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,680
become your words your words become your

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,450
actions your actions become your habits

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,220
your habits become your deployment

00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,510
tooling and your deployment tooling

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,160
ultimately becomes your destiny so I

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:38,790
think I couldn't really say it any

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:42,050
better than that yeah so we're going to

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:44,670
dig into each of these a little bit so

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,610
beliefs beliefs are interesting because

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,590
one belief can inform you know dozens or

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,140
hundreds or thousands of actions you

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,880
have so beliefs are really a high

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,130
leverage place to think about

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,990
organizational change and DevOps and

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:03,000
your organization if you're able to

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:05,190
identify those beliefs and and kind of

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,810
either change them or even just

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,880
understand them you know if you're able

00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,950
to change them you'll able to be able to

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,050
change the actions of you know many

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,020
people and many actions over time so

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:18,300
it's a high leverage place to focus kind

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,190
of your energy I think one interesting

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,000
thing with beliefs is that they have an

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,920
interesting relationship with like truth

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,710
and correctness so the leaves can be

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:32,100
absolutely true or absolutely false or

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,750
probably true or probably false and it

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,990
doesn't really matter as long as someone

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,010
believes something as long as they're

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,480
they are kind of background and

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,920
experience has led them that that's an

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,760
important thing that they believe in

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,860
that it doesn't even matter if it's true

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,840
for example this guy hanging off a cliff

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm not sure what he's believing right

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,010
now he might be believing this is

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,900
promote Lee safe not crazy he might be

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,570
believing he's going to claim back to

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,820
the rock but if I was in his shoes I

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,070
would pretty much be believing I was in

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,600
a pretty tight spot and almost certainly

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:14,430
it ends blatt shortly and so there's

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:17,040
quote about what people believe to be

00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,500
true is which is that which is coherent

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,230
to their already established cache of

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,750
truisms I like this because it kind of

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,630
represented that that accumulation of

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,880
experience leading leading to a set of

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,930
beliefs I also liked it because it has

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,970
the word cash in

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,130
and is a nerd that makes me think of

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,050
like oh like my varnish cash or

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,030
something like that and we all know it

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,890
happens with cached objects right

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:44,370
sometimes they get a little stale

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:47,250
they're not so relevant or fresh and we

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,470
what do we need to do we need to purge

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,360
those caches flush those gashes so we

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,220
also have these like belief caches built

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,920
up within each of us and even within

00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:01,620
groups of people and sometimes you know

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:05,130
we need it we need to flush that cash so

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,690
the havior is people are creatures of

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,300
habit right you do an action a couple

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,580
times those become routine routines

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,320
become habits habits are hard because

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,820
you don't really ever think about them

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,530
at all right so they're not a place

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,670
where you can kind of apply logic or

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,430
something they're almost kind of

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,800
automatic they're hard to change I think

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,860
there's some good research that forming

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,520
or just drawing habits takes about like

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,080
about 30 days of repetition and so

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,640
that's kind of one of the things you're

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,140
going to be up against is these

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,640
behaviors and these habits that have

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,420
built up with the team members and

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,910
within the organization and that's kind

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:46,440
of an uphill battle especially attacking

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:48,390
it on the behavior level and then so the

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,860
systems we have the tools we have this

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,550
is super broad right this can be

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,590
everything from the language that we use

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:57,900
to the kind of you know the develop the

00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,730
tools we use to manage the development

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,830
process whether Sprint's or waterfall

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,750
and all that let it down to the kind of

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,390
individual I don't know lines of code or

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,120
libraries we use or anything else and I

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,310
think we're all familiar with them the

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,550
adage of if all you have is a hammer

00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:17,670
everything looks like a nail and I think

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:20,610
that's a really good explanation of why

00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,740
tools are so important if you use tools

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,620
everyday or they're really familiar to

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,480
you they actually can really frame your

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,560
understanding of the world around you in

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,880
a pretty serious way so basically we

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,010
need to be attacking kind of all of

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,620
these all of these different areas

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,090
beliefs behaviors and systems when we

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,990
want to introduce some positive change

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,850
okay so this is a little audience

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,790
partition participation X

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,590
sighs you don't have to participate but

00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,590
I would appreciate if you did and I'm

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:55,320
going to participate too so what do you

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,910
believe that others don't right so these

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,200
are kind of your differentiating beliefs

00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,840
these are things you can leverage

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,700
because ultimately the you know we

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,680
talked about how believe that beliefs

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,900
are a high leverage place to focus and

00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,400
if you're able to identify just some

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,680
core belief you have that someone

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,650
doesn't you can use that to your

00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,540
advantage so these are some of the

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,800
things i believe simple can be effective

00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,480
you know it doesn't need to be

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,540
complicated in a big workflow or

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,250
something you know you know have fun or

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,780
you're doing it wrong I think not every

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,480
believes that but that's pretty court at

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,550
what I do and a couple other ones so the

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,740
audience-participation part now is that

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,450
you pull out your smartphone and you can

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,810
use like Twitter or like email and you

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:40,320
can just like email to yourself or or

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:44,850
your teammate or your mom or me I'm Nick

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,930
at Pantheon I oh and just going to just

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,510
being the subject or whatever you just

00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,520
say just write down one belief that you

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,380
have that other people that not

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,360
everybody shares this could be about

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,390
DevOps or deployment or the

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,660
comfortableness of the seat you're in or

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,970
or your feelings of New Orleans or

00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,210
anything else so I'm going to do this

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,210
right now

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,509
there's no text in the subject i'm going

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,509
to send anyway

00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:54,730
alright well let anyone finish up its

00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:59,259
still doing that mine was that I believe

00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:02,379
this is going pretty well so far better

00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:03,789
than I thought I hope you guys show that

00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,779
but i'm not sure everyone else does so

00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:07,269
i'm not sure how much I can lever

00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:10,929
leverage that for um for future wisdom

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:13,570
but but I think this is an exciting

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:15,789
little exercise and it just took 30

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,799
seconds in the middle of some talk at

00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,659
drupalcon and maybe you guys will hit

00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,249
upon a belief that it's quarter who you

00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:25,899
are and what you can bring to the table

00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:30,249
to to realize the positive future out

00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:33,039
there cool going to go quickly into some

00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:35,769
belief and behavior and system examples

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,169
like from my experience particularly

00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:40,659
Pantheon and how these might constitute

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:45,970
some challenges for you know basically a

00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:47,980
successful team so what one belief i

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,789
held firmly a you know a couple years

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:55,149
ago is that shipping rapidly is more

00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:56,529
important than shipping perfectly and

00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:58,509
i'm not telling you this is the right

00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:00,279
belief for you or this is a kind of a

00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:02,440
truism we already talked about how

00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:06,399
beliefs have an interesting relationship

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,549
with truth but for me at the time this

00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:10,929
is a belief i held pretty dearly

00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,999
arguably you know maybe it was the

00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,369
correct belief at the time because you

00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:16,929
know pant down was you know just trying

00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:20,739
to just trying to make it happen in just

00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:22,090
a couple people and we didn't want the

00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:24,940
kind of perfect to be the enemy of the

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,950
good but this effect Pantheon in pretty

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,799
drastic ways so this affected who we

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,259
hired what roles we hard for and when

00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,450
what kind of skill sets we hard for and

00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:37,629
what even you know hiring other people

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,669
that believe this this affected how we

00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:42,399
are project management tools this

00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:45,940
affected our deployment strategies this

00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,159
affected like I think this is a good

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,970
example of one belief determining that

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,950
outcomes of many actions and so I'm not

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,710
sure you know like there's also the

00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,869
question of is this the right belief for

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,600
Pantheon at this time yeah probably less

00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:06,270
so certainly less so than it was

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:08,010
years ago on but that's where we were

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,630
and that did shape a lot of kind of who

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:13,290
we are at Pantheon but there's still

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:17,880
room to change and actually need to

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:19,980
change so I was thinking of this one how

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,700
many people like log on to a server and

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,050
do sudo su ever right and this is one of

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,420
those ones that I think is a great

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,490
behavior example because this just like

00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,560
flies off your fingertips if you're used

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,450
to doing this it's like SSH sudo su BAM

00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,430
and you don't even you're not you're

00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,200
classically not thinking about what

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,460
security your kind of circumventing or

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,290
you're not even think about security at

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,050
all it's just your fingertips like

00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,090
flying on the keyboard really ingrained

00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,650
behavior and habit I do this with like a

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,930
lot of command-line stuff if I'm like

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,750
writing a blog post or like sending a

00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,910
text message or whatever like if I zone

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,340
out and zone back in I'll just the my

00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,470
fingers will type LS enter like I'm what

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,540
directory of my end when I'm in like a

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,310
word doc or something right and I don't

00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,560
think I can ever really change that for

00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,970
myself and that's you know I don't think

00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,860
that's a terribly destructive behavior

00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,230
but but it is a behavior that's hard to

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,910
change and so you know early at Pantheon

00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,980
it was like David and Josh and me and

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,630
Ray and like weed you know log on you

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,430
know like didn't have any customers

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,200
whatever so we're like logging on and

00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,520
you know you log on sudo su do some

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,610
stuff on a server try to move it forward

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,780
and this became a pretty you know kind

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,690
of ingrained habit that's the same

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,100
shooter sooo you know then we hire a

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,390
couple more people hey we trust them

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,190
they're like oh how do I do this you're

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,890
like okay you just as edge of the server

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,750
okay okay yeah you now you need a sudo

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,520
su just yeah just get rude and then you

00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,020
know go around and then you know we

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,550
continue to grow the organization and

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,920
like kind of look around and were like

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,060
oh my gosh we actually not only do we

00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,890
have this behavior that's totally

00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,630
unthinking and is like kind of bypassing

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,990
a lot of like good security practices

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:55,050
which are like totally feasible in Linux

00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,760
and whatever we've kind of trained like

00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,830
a bunch of people to do this really dumb

00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,750
thing and then when we had to kind of

00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:05,010
take that away on you know it was it was

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,600
it was that was a hard organizational

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,000
change you know taking stuff away from

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,770
people is always hard but I like this

00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,050
example of the behavior because some of

00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,610
the stuff you do on the command line

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,930
something you're totally not thinking

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,160
your fingers you know maybe you're just

00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,720
clicking your mouse or whatever in some

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,340
web UI or just kind of flying through

00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,050
something and not even really thinking

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,610
of the repercussions and then worse

00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:26,420
you're kind of like trading up new

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:31,330
people to do the same thing currently

00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:34,100
nobody does this at Pantheon anymore and

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,990
then like a tools thing you have a good

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,910
tools and systems example so Pantheon is

00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,550
employees kind of all over the world and

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:43,550
France and Romania and Montana and

00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:46,750
Oregon and minneapolis and san francisco

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:49,490
and Cape Town and Prague and New Zealand

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:52,130
and so you know we believe that's an

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:55,310
effective way to great get kind of

00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:57,950
amazing developer and engineer and

00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:00,980
otherwise kind of skill sets and people

00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,840
on the team but there's a lot of

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,440
friction in making that work we have

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,010
tried so many combinations of kind of

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,560
sass tools and different microphones and

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,020
wide-angle webcams and like all these

00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,360
things to try to make it work we have a

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,430
pretty good solution I can like share if

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,050
you guys want later but but the

00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,090
experimentation isn't done right we've

00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,430
done expensive things like by a robot

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,800
where people can like tell it whatever

00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,590
tella in and like drive it around the

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,400
office and stuff which is pretty cool

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,080
but I but doesn't get used a ton we've

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,970
done other like super cheap stuff like

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,960
in our slide templates where we know

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,060
we're going to have a bunch of remote

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,040
people we actually block out an area at

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,350
the bottom that you don't put content in

00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,360
so that we can keep the faces up so you

00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,130
can see the faces of your like remote

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,970
team while you're while you'r kind of

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,770
watching the presentation and so this is

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,090
an example of how just like the friction

00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,770
of like you'd think this stuff is a

00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,170
solved problem but it's definitely not

00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,720
and this is something you need to kind

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,240
of keep you know Sisyphus keep pushing

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,580
that AV AV rock up the hill until you

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,140
get it right or it's never done right

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,710
until you get a workable solution move

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:16,220
on from there alright so building your

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:18,470
dev ops game plan this is a quote from

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:22,090
eisenhower that i like to butcher the

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,090
one i like to say is

00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,300
plans are useless planning is essential

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,970
and I guess this is what he actually

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,130
actually said but it's Morton to talk

00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,910
about planning for a little bit so if

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,530
you if you want to just kind of break

00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,930
out your laptop and start dev opping

00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,980
like by all means do that you know

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,690
you'll have some fun maybe you'll

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,070
install like some chef stuff or some

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,960
like you know continuous integration

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,120
stuff and it's going to be awesome but

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,800
if you really want to and I think you

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,270
know engineers and I'm an engineer and

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,250
stuff like that feels really good to

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,780
like hack on stuff but if you really

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,550
want to bring change your organization

00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,670
you're going to need at least a little

00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,500
bit of a plan so that's what we're going

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,910
to go into of course after you make that

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,190
plan as Eisenhower said it's going to be

00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:09,150
totally useless but it's still essential

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:11,010
or indispensable so what makes a good

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,600
game plan right it should be actionable

00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,580
right the goal is you're actually going

00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,860
to act on this it should be you should

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,290
be able to communicate it well whether

00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,020
that's getting advice from people or

00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,910
sharing out to your team or or getting

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,380
to remote employees you know who might

00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,780
who might not be in the room when you're

00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,760
kind of developing these ideas it should

00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,550
be adaptable to be able to change to the

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,170
circumstances that arise it should

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:38,610
encourage kind of long-term alignment

00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:40,320
but also set some real goals notice that

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:44,550
in your game plan I didn't say anything

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:48,360
about having the rock in it or cute dogs

00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:52,710
or people in tutus and it turns out that

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:57,630
was kind of a crappy movie anyway but

00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:00,270
okay here it is so BAM POW wowza this is

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:02,850
how we're going to build our DevOps game

00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:06,230
plan so this is kind of a modification

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:08,790
of the Toyota kata kata is a word that's

00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,340
root meaning is basically a form so this

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:14,460
comes from martial arts it could also be

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,580
for dance or cooking or in this case an

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,220
improvement the yuan business processes

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:22,350
this came out of analyzing the Toyota

00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,350
Production system the precursor to lean

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:27,060
manufacturing and so I think this is

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,260
pretty genius it's and this goes back to

00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,060
like one of the beliefs that I hold is

00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,010
like simple can be effective and this is

00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,480
really simple and it can be really

00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,960
effective it doesn't you know it needs

00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,220
some like complex plan

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,700
this is enough to get you going and

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,809
we're going to dig into it a little bit

00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,149
basically has these four quadrants and

00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:47,049
we're going to go in a little more depth

00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:50,559
on each one and if you're going to need

00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:52,899
plans within plans we're going to need

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,100
some big plans some little plans you

00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:56,230
might you know your big plan might be

00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,730
like do DevOps and make awesome and then

00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,860
your medium plan might be like okay

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,480
reduce kind of cycle time or delivery

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,370
time to two weeks and then your little

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,409
plan might be like oh let's get our

00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:08,169
tests running and you know under 20

00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:08,919
minutes instead of under an hour so

00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:13,059
you're going to need these kind of

00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,770
different fractal levels of plans and

00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,450
now we're going to deconstruct the kata

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:21,450
a little bit and go into kind of each

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:21,450
quadrant and how these can help you so

00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:30,610
the top left quadrant one of my favorite

00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:33,700
four quadrants of the Toyota kata is I

00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,350
like summarized as the now / problem so

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,600
this helps you to find the problem space

00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:41,590
before thinking about the solution space

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:45,490
so we are all great problem solvers a

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:47,679
lot of us are paid to solve problems in

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:50,470
one way or another whether that's with

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,340
code or people management or anything

00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:56,260
else and one thing that that I think all

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,320
of us fall prey to a little bit and

00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:02,140
certainly me is thinking about the

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,360
solution and not defining the problem so

00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,309
it's really critical in the in the this

00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,770
cot death at the problem the now /

00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:12,369
problem section is separate from the

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,929
solution within your org this is

00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:16,960
important because this helps kind of

00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:20,950
remove some of the emotion of this so

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,859
like if this was you know my kitchen

00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,990
counter at home they're probably a lot

00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:28,960
of motion emotions there might be some

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:31,720
words like totally disgusting and stuff

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,889
like that and those same emotions are

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,270
you know president in the workplace and

00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,089
maybe even be like all right let's okay

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,800
I get you are disgusted but let's let's

00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:40,330
try to think you know realistically here

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,310
what's the actual problem we're trying

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:47,290
to solve and this also has a little hack

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,940
that the sooner you start agreeing on

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,290
stuff

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,510
soon as you start agreeing on what the

00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:56,730
problem is you've already kind of driven

00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:59,760
some level of alignment moving on to the

00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,500
definition of awesome I can't remember I

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,329
think this is like Spotify steak or

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,329
something on the cot too but I like

00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:08,280
these names so the definition of awesome

00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:12,000
is where you can think about the kind of

00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,250
constraint free unbridled fantasy world

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,520
what this thing how this thing would be

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:19,290
solved this is this other little game I

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,450
like to play here which is like how much

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:23,280
can we agree about in 15 minutes right

00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:26,220
don't worry about what you don't agree

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,400
worry about where you can agree and get

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,750
as much of that down this is vital again

00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,550
it's that hack where you start agreeing

00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:37,829
on something and secondly if you can all

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,329
agree in this like far distant future of

00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:41,579
where you're going you can kind of

00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:43,770
lineup solutions and kind of

00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,560
implementations towards that you know if

00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:49,349
you think we're going to Australia and

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,290
you think we're going to the moon and we

00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:53,400
don't understand that up front we were

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,520
probably going to end up building

00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:02,220
different pedal based solutions to get

00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:03,480
there yeah and this can be fun too

00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,890
because you can say no no no don't worry

00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,390
about those constraints don't worry

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,130
about time don't worry about people

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,170
don't worry about money let's just think

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:15,450
about what and what we really want here

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:19,829
if it was totally perfect so the next

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:21,690
segment is the next target condition so

00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:23,190
this is where we start to apply some

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,710
constraints this will change /

00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:29,040
organization it could be I think a kind

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,780
of good general rule is like although

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,210
totally depends is like is this going to

00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,430
take like like five people for five

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,079
weeks is like kind of an amount of time

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,510
that you could actually realize some

00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,510
real change but it's one important you

00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,579
get to a stable state right if Sisyphus

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,500
is pushing that rock uphill he's not

00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,720
going to like stop on the super steep

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,369
part where he could if he linked like

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,810
the stretches back where the rock and

00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,819
roll down right he's going to get it up

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:58,470
to a little plateau and then you know

00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:59,340
take a power bar goo and hydrate a

00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,130
little bit

00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,450
then get ready to push back up so I

00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,860
think these two things one really

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,720
important to understand what a stable

00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,310
state is again we never know what's

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,380
going to happen even with the best laid

00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,910
plans but if we get our you know our

00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,860
technology or a process or our team or

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,930
whatever it is to a state where it won't

00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,970
like automatically regress if we can

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,590
look away for a few minutes that lets us

00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,360
be agile and kind of turn around and

00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,690
focus on something else that comes up if

00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,610
it needs to and not lose that work like

00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:28,050
the idea of conceivable effort you know

00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,150
conceivable is like can you actually

00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:33,000
kind of conceive of that in my small

00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,460
human brain like yeah five weeks that's

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,560
like after you know my wife's birthday

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,620
or whatever or like okay yeah let's

00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,030
let's give that a shot and again the

00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,340
specifics of the constraints you apply

00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,260
will be specific to your contacts in

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,760
your organization bigger orgs you might

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,190
be like hey we're going to get in it you

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,840
know a year other people might be like

00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,290
hey we've got two hours afternoon let's

00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,190
see if we can we can stable state commit

00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:00,390
the code or whatever agree on the change

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,860
although you do part of this is you do

00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,840
want to break these up into like pretty

00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:07,020
small like basically as small chunks as

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,600
you can um just to reduce the risk of

00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,520
moving forward you can always fall back

00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,440
to the definition of awesome but you're

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,800
focusing on the next possible stable

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,330
state basically and then lastly we're

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,620
going to talk about first step so what

00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:24,600
can we start doing right now that will

00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,090
help us start moving towards the next

00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,070
stable state towards the long term long

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:33,200
term vision just like this cute little

00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,200
duck waddling off into the sunset

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:44,770
I live with that for just you know

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,760
they've proven that ducks are the

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:54,579
funniest animals and I think duck BOTS

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,710
might then are even funnier so there you

00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:57,730
have it this is the kata this is the

00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,099
form that we're going to put into

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,619
practice and continue to kind of work

00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:07,150
with within artwork and work through

00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:09,520
overtime reinvent constantly as needed

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,660
you're welcome to kinda like this is a

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,160
good starting place you're at like

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,460
welcome to kind of tweak it as your you

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,940
know as your circumstances need but this

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:28,599
is the basis so we're going to go into

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:30,670
some into a couple examples and there's

00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,609
like an opportunity for improv in here

00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:37,810
if anyone's really into improv or we can

00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:38,950
skip that do that offline get it off but

00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,140
so we're going to go through a couple of

00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:44,500
these doing the dishes which is like one

00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,960
from my home life you know trying to get

00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,460
some positive improvement there looking

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,750
at our on-call rotation which is

00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,050
something that we're actively kind of

00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:57,190
discussing at Pantheon and then and then

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:59,109
we'll see where we go from there so you

00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,150
know okay so my wife and I are like okay

00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:02,980
you know she's pissed it's disgusting

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,500
all right let's define the problem here

00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,650
okay I totally agree nobody could miss

00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:12,520
it that the dishes are covering the sink

00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:14,349
yeah and the and the utensils you know

00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,359
our dirty and she's like and moreover

00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:18,220
when I want to go make cookies I can't

00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:20,230
and so now I kind of pick up I'm like

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,060
all right that's totally true i totally

00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:26,650
agree this lack of cookies is totally

00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:28,810
untenable and so then we're okay greed

00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,700
boom let's go to looks like what would

00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:33,310
be awesome about you know our kitchen

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:36,339
and a relationship with each other visa

00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:38,230
V the kitchen cool yeah the pans are

00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:41,380
clean yeah things are put away oh that

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,940
because that makes that makes okay we

00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,490
have we can get homemade cookies pretty

00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,319
much any time in 38 minutes yeah that

00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,000
would require like the cookies put away

00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,590
or

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,760
utensils like put in the right spot so

00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,550
we know where they are so we can

00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,870
streamline that whole thing okay cookies

00:40:53,550 --> 00:41:00,780
in 38 minutes that would be awesome yeah

00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,220
and then okay realistically where we're

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,270
going to get from here you know this is

00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:07,440
kinda where you can break it down

00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:09,390
further okay so maybe we don't need

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,410
always need a new batch of cookies but

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,970
it would be if we make a big enough

00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,500
batch like we can always have cookies

00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,090
around so I think that's like a pretty

00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,380
good stable state that like in our lives

00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,090
we just introduced that there are always

00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,740
these homemade cookies and that will

00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:21,360
have like some backstop that like at

00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,610
least our kitchen operations are good

00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,320
enough that you know we're able to make

00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:30,150
a batch and we need to replenish the

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:32,100
batch that somebody's gobbling on and so

00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,560
I think like I wasn't able to like

00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,940
really manage it in this talk but i

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,980
think you know metrics quantitative

00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,330
goals are really important so even like

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,770
some of these will be qualitative and

00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,210
that's cool but as much as like

00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,160
quantitative goals and metrics as you

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,960
can put in here that really just like

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,780
helps that's another tool for an

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,210
alignment and probably worth a whole

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,070
talk on its own then we're like okay

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,870
getting to first steps and I'm like well

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,750
you know I would like honestly I would

00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:59,610
do the dishes but I don't like the way

00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,310
my hands feel when they're all like

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:06,540
soapy and stuff all right that's easy

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:08,880
amazon going to get you some big gloves

00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,980
for doing all these dirty work kind of a

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,260
couple other things i have these big

00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,490
gloves they're like so thick i think

00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,590
they're from japan and they're like

00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:21,110
fishing gloves or something but they

00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:25,800
make me feel like you know i don't know

00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:28,320
totally capable of getting in there so

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,540
that boom we're on our way we have a

00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,920
plan we've throughout this process we've

00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,140
gotten a high degree of alignment on

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,000
where we are now objectively why that's

00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,850
a problem where we want to go in the far

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,870
distant future of our you know kitchen

00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:44,610
operating vision we know we think we can

00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:46,920
get to a stable stable state which will

00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,290
be easy to show whether we've made it

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:54,690
there or not as well as some some first

00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:56,670
steps yet so the next one is a little

00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,590
more relevant like to work and stuff

00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,690
like that but so we have this problem it

00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,500
paint they on we do have people all over

00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,870
but

00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,480
kind of on the EU time zone we have a

00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:09,450
lot fewer people and so we have a lot

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,330
fewer people there that particular there

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,380
on the on-call rotation and then that's

00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,840
hard for them because they end up

00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,880
spending a lot of time on call you know

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,010
we want to treat on call is a top

00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,310
priority to make sure our systems are

00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:26,670
reliable and sites have the the best of

00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,990
time that we can manage but for this

00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,180
team in the you they're spending like an

00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,860
inordinate amount of time kind of being

00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,620
a little more reactive and not enough

00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,940
time being proactive we're getting more

00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,300
or you know hiring more and more great

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,220
engineers and so the rotation is getting

00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,860
bigger now we have like eight or ten

00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,370
people in the rotation in US alone but

00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:49,140
that means the distance the time between

00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,940
when you're on call is spreading out and

00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,320
so that means there's kind of less of a

00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,120
good feedback loop where we're actually

00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,850
able to fix problems and just end up

00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:59,550
kind of break fixing what we see there's

00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:02,820
so much tribal knowledge so it's really

00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:05,010
hard to train new people on on you know

00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,720
what's it what the expectations and the

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,980
tools and the tricks and the everything

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,970
else that goes along with kind of

00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:15,000
debugging our production systems and so

00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,770
like as a manager my team is kind of you

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,340
know like I've only been a manager for a

00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:25,950
few years and a couple times my team is

00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:27,990
very vocally kind of said dude you know

00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,640
we're here to solve problems you can't

00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,680
solve all their problems and if you do

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,780
if you try even though it looks okay

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,890
here like you're not going to we're not

00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,090
going to implement the best solution

00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,320
that we have because we know a lot about

00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,570
this stuff because we're doing a day to

00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,430
day so this is kind of a case we're

00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:44,130
using the kata to help break out the

00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:47,820
problem space from the solution space

00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:49,440
and letting them handle that working on

00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,960
definition of awesome we have clear

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,640
expectations about what's being on call

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,270
it's not relying on judgment so that

00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,010
means kind of on our playbooks anyone

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,630
can follow a playbook like if it's your

00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:02,220
first day you could be on call and still

00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,630
follow a playbook and you don't need to

00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,780
know a ton of this stuff about how the

00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:09,519
system operates table to be effective

00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:12,189
reducing the number of alerts and

00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:18,640
and I think you guys can kind of take

00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:20,619
away the rest so this is where I was

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,130
going to do the improv one but I'm not

00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:26,829
quite sure we're up for it today I don't

00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:31,899
think there's any huge improv fan so you

00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:38,439
can go through this on your own and with

00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:40,779
that wrap things up a little bit so

00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:43,329
hopefully I've convinced you and I hope

00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:45,729
everyone here is in the room you know

00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:48,099
believes that there's a better way to do

00:45:45,729 --> 00:45:49,599
whatever it is we're doing you know

00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:52,569
we're excited and we're ready to be an

00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,839
active fearless change agent with on our

00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:57,880
team and organization we have some tools

00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,189
now to help a line on the kind of the

00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,619
collective vision in the future and

00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:07,269
we're going to focus on some actionable

00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:11,709
next steps to deliver change and lastly

00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:13,929
but not least everyone here has to draw

00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:17,380
from find and draw from sources of

00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:20,259
inspiration this is one of one source of

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,659
inspiration for myself this is a picture

00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:27,179
of Franconia Notch in New Hampshire in

00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:31,749
the white mountains and in this quote

00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:33,819
always rising never steeply and this is

00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:36,159
something I've repeated it's kind of a

00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:37,689
mantra for myself for a while you don't

00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:39,669
need to change the world and kind of big

00:46:37,689 --> 00:46:41,229
steps and bounds as long as you're

00:46:39,669 --> 00:46:45,339
getting a little bit better every day

00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:46,469
and Jay Rayner Edmonds was one of the

00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:50,169
heads of the Appalachian Mountain Club

00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:52,209
towards the end of the 1800's who had

00:46:50,169 --> 00:46:54,369
this vision about recreation in the

00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,989
these mountains about creating a system

00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:59,079
of huts and trails that was always

00:46:55,989 --> 00:47:02,519
rising never steeply and in fairness

00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,689
there's like quite a bit of steep stuff

00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,219
but this is always something I've been

00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:08,829
drawn to to kind of wake up in the

00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:10,509
morning and get out of bed and you know

00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:13,449
just try to make the world a little bit

00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:18,029
better of a place one smile one laughs

00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:18,029
one shared goal one active collaboration

00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:25,940
yeah so that's kind of what I'll leave

00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:28,250
you guys with and if you want more of

00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:32,630
this another one of my DevOps

00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:36,950
inspirations Michelle you can't say

00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:40,640
Krejci without CI Krejci is talking

00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:44,300
Thursday about DevOps in the chocolate

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,530
factory or something like that if

00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,100
anybody wants to rape me I would

00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:51,220
appreciate the feedback and some other

00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,150
content that might help you guys so

00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,500
thank you so much everyone for coming

00:47:53,150 --> 00:48:01,070
hopefully that was useful happy to have

00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:03,020
taken autonomy questions so are you

00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:04,640
still scared of DevOps in the back I

00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,790
think we might have scared them out

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,470
entirely but yeah any questions I can

00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,470
answer it or we can take them offline

00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:24,460
yes the question was can I back up a

00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,460
slide

00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,940
yes

00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,839
