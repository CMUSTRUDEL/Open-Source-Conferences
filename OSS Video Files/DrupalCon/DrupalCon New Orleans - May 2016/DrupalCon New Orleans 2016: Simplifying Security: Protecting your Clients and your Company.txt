Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Simplifying Security: Protecting your Clients and your Company
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Do you have the answers to your client's security questions? Do you know what questions you should be asking your clients to assess their security risk? During this session we’ll walk through how to have the “security conversation” with your clients, build a team and a process that gives you the confidence to take on larger and more complex projects which bring in additional revenue. Your reputation as an agency (and your client’s business) rely on a safe and secure site. By knowing the common pitfalls you can help navigate the treacherous waters of web security and lead your team to success and happy clients along the way.

How Drupal 8 stacks up for security and selling clients on migrations

Are you asking your clients the right questions during discovery?

Top 5 security myths

I’m too small to be a target

Private companies are not regulated

Encryption is complicated

Security kills performance

Proper encryption and key management is expensive and difficult

Ogres are like Onions: Security has layers. We’ll go through each of the following layers to your site and business to discuss what needs to be protected, who needs to be involved and good tools to use to create a baseline of security.

Platform (stack under the CMS)

Backend (PHP / Application Layer)

Front-End (HTML and Javascript)

Organizational (Password and key management, Security Response Plans)

Security is good for business:

Win More RFPs!

Government, Education and e-commerce platforms are great wins but come with heightened security requirements

Reduce your risk as an agency when building client sites

Minimize exposure to sensitive client data

Evaluating hosting options based on security

Just because they say PCI compliant doesn’t mean you are

leveraging hosting platform tools to improve processes

Case Studies of various types of clients and their security needs

business track in general so if you're

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,230

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,030
your own Drupal undertakings and and

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,870
helping other people leverage the

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,539
benefit of Drupal I think you're going

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,690
to want to enjoy and pop in an adder

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,329
business track during the course of the

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,110
week and you're starting off the right

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:11,880
way with a presentation on security

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:15,509
issues so so welcome thank you a little

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,909
bit about ffw and who we are what we

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:23,400
used to be and what we hope to continue

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:25,920
to do so we used to be known where as

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,960
blink reaction and pro people and three

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,020
or four other brands internationally and

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,350
last year we came together and became

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,079
wow the largest Drupal service agency of

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,869
its kind on the planet and we well we

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:45,350
consider that that may be a temporary

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:47,610
condition because it's a very variable

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,310
business and many of you in the audience

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,909
may it may aspire but what we really

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,920
hope that you aspire to is what we try

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,939
to be not just the biggest but hopefully

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,850
one of the best in doing that and one of

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,100
the ways that we like to think that we

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,220
are one of the best is by providing as

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,630
much support as we possibly can to the

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,690
Drupal community so we're back again

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,540
this year as a diamond sponsor of

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,270
drupalcon very proud of it or diamond

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:23,650
sponsors last year when we launched our

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:27,550
new brand identity we're about 400

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,770
people strong across the globe and we

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,980
really did it because we wanted to be

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,330
able to serve our clients and the Drupal

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,700
community from a global perspective

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,190
because many of our clients are large

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,300
enterprise organizations that have that

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:46,440
work in those different markets and so

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,810
rather than then leave those clients

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,270
without the ability to get qualified

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,190
Drupal services in those markets with

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,080
folks they had worked with we felt that

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,150
we had to grow with them and grow with

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,730
Drupal and I think that's probably the

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:04,810
reason why a lot of you all are here as

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,520
well so one of the very special things

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:11,860
that we do and I have the privilege of

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:15,310
doing is managing the Drupal 8 excuse me

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,220
the ffw center of excellence and so if

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,210
you care to visit our website ffw

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:25,480
agency.com / event and we have a whole

00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:28,630
bunch of free Drupal training online and

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,120
in different markets and that really

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:35,920
brings me to the next bet than the next

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,270

hour you've got three individuals here

00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,510

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,209
a very long time none of whom I know

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,820

for the enterprise we've been focusing

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,730
on grupo lately and I do a lot of

00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,280
business development within the Drupal

00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,770
community and we work a lot with Drupal

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,280
shops who need to deploy encryption and

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,470
key management to meet compliance and

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,230

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,540
title founder of cellar door media and

as well locker a product that we just

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,950
recently launched a couple months ago

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,080
the cellar door side of things we've

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,690
been doing for many years now we do apps

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,160
and web site development and is as we're

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,050
going through that we found the need for

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,450
more security and so we built our own

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:30,700
key management as a service platform

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:31,750
called locker so all right so we're

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,960
going to start off with you know like

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,600
the let's wake up quick gain so just

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,010
like show of hands how many people at

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,470
you know like in your own personal web

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,680
use how many of you reuse email

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,960
addresses when you sign up for accounts

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,670
like should how many of you are that's

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,160
okay right all right and usernames

00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:54,160
likewise username same username same use

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,840
name yet anyone ever share a password

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,670
occasionally maybe just on the services

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,900
you don't care about you know nobody not

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:03,490
your friends but like yeah real names

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,820
and like gota that you create accounts

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,500
you've got your real names date of birth

00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,820
posting things publicly on linkedin

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:16,660
facebook doing any of that twitter a lot

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,010
yeah a lot of these so one of the things

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,670
that a lot of us think about when we

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,380
think about security is that it's about

00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:26,120
cards and that's actually not really

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:28,730
true credit cards are yes an asset but

00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,800
in like the the dark market that's out

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,590
there the value of a credit card the

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
stolen credit card is it's going to

00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,350
range it's going to depend on time and

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,330
place and other things like that but say

00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,620
the order of magnitude five to thirty

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,640
dollars something like that stolen

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,320
credit card one of the reasons for that

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,790
is because the credit card companies are

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,370
really good about shutting things down

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,750
right they see a fraudulent purchase how

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,370
many people have had that happen I mean

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,040
I certainly have right they're really

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,200
quite good about it the on the other

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,060
hand things that you can do with

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,030
personally identifiable information and

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,040
take and sort of fake a person's actual

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,110
information and use it to say create a

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,030
medical record that's orders of

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,410
magnitude much more valuable to someone

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,350
who wants to use your information

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,730
maliciously open up bank accounts or do

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,640
all kinds of things like that that's

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,410
hundreds of dollars per account so

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,230
piecing together information from

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,050
facebook linkedin other accounts and

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,820
such is is in fact what hackers would

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,980
like to do if you leave a credit card

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,480
lying around they'll take it but that's

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,580
not the only thing they're looking for

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,870
and it's really important to realize

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,550
that a lot of the information that we

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,570
work with on a regular basis is actually

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,980
stuff that's potentially like a resource

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,430
for hackers and something that we need

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,680
to be careful of securing all right so I

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,990
in an interesting stat here from the

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,080
identity theft Resource Center as of may

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,470
third so you know what a week ago so far

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:57,620
this year there have been 348 breaches

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:59,540
with 11 million 360 1547 records exposed

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,180
I mean that's that's pretty

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,890
mind-boggling I think about it and we're

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,260
only five months into the app that's

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,120
crazy that's this year yeah so you know

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,310
we as we talked about you know just be

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,650
careful what kind of information is

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,250
online I actually recently had just as

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,020
an example had a friend who whose

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,810
facebook got hacked they had a lot of

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,000
public information so a hacker actually

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,640
recreated this person's facebook account

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,400
their name all of their pictures like

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,970
galleries everything and then started to

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,879
like me

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,230
information from like the friend list so

00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,480
you're just going to be very careful

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,579
about that and there's a very famous

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,639
hack that happened a few years back with

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:43,220
one of the editors were wired and the

00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,199
the hacker was able to go to Amazon and

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,459
go to customer service and say hey I'm

00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,779
having some issues getting into my

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:50,060
account can you help me out and I go oh

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:51,860
is this the account that ends in with

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,930
credit card 1234 and they go oh yeah

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,420
that's it what's your email address I

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,040
forgot hang up then they called up Apple

00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,209
and said hey I need access to my iCloud

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,189
account they go can you give us the last

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:02,540
four digits of your credit card one two

00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:05,420
three four and they were able to get in

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,899
reset the iCloud erase years and years

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,209
of this guy's family pictures his all of

00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,769
his accounts all of his devices and it

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,939
was all just so that they can get access

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:20,470
to a three-letter Twitter account and so

00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:22,399
it's a good example that seemingly

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,829
information that you don't think is very

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,209
important can be used and can be

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:28,129
leveraged in many different situations

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,689
and so as we're building websites and

00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,329
some of us are building some very large

00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,399
websites we need to we need to talk to

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:36,910
each other and and know what are we

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,110
using AZ identifies what are we using

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,209
and what are we storing and what are we

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,559
giving people access to because if I

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:44,449
have something that I think is is

00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,180
worthless and it's all of a sudden your

00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:48,680
identifier we have an ability to cross

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,889
over and have a hack and just take a

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,319
quick look at the slide look at look at

00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,579
all the top reaches there and think

00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:58,309
about how many of those actually involve

00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:01,589
credit cards not really a lot so just to

00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:05,079
kind of make a point there

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,550
yeah and if your and and if that

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,440
concerns you and you sort of wonder like

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,000
what what do I out there it's okay to

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,000
check right now have I been pwned calm

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,350
it is a is a site throwing an email

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,449
addresses to actually run by a security

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,060
researcher I'm not going to do any more

00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:24,040
than you know sort of mentioned that you

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:28,420
can just check that and no so we all

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,399
like this quote upon his capture in 1934

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,110
willie sutton was a bank robber was

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,690
asked by the FBI agents why do you rob

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,899
banks his answer is because that's where

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,490
the money is and so you have to think

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,839
about people are coming to your site's

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,970
hackers are coming to your sites because

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:46,120
that's where the information is that's

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,110
where the money is for them and so you

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,139
know we're going to be talking about

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,480
scale if you're small or large you have

00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:56,160
information that is worth something to

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,160
someone so you need to think about that

00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:03,350
just got a question in the Google slides

00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:06,279
that says what's the URL for that

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,829
website I'm assuming that it's for the

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:13,550
the big infographic it's posted at the

00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:14,660
bottom of it unfortunately the projector

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,009
is kind of cutting off the bottom one

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,910
thing I did forget to mention is that if

00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:21,739
you go to this session on the events

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,939
page we do have the slides already

00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,290
posted up there so you can follow along

00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:30,949
locally if you want to do that as well

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:34,429
yeah talk about that yeah so breaches

00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:35,989
are not a matter of if but when Robert

00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,360
Mueller the former director of the FBI

00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:39,769
was quoted as saying there are only two

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,049
types of companies those that have been

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,759
hacked and those that will be and it's

00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:44,899
even merging into one category those

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,519
that have been hacked and those that

00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,049
will be again and one that we like to

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,329
add to that is those that don't even

00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:52,220
know they've been hacked and so

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,749
sometimes people can get in and start

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,709
siphoning off information and you just

00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:59,629
don't even know it and so if you can get

00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,389
anything out of this session yes we all

00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:03,559
know credit cards are important

00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,910
hopefully none of you are storing credit

00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,879
cards I'll get to some stories about

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,309
that later but what we want to emphasize

00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,980
here is that security on your site is

00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,869
more than just a credit card there's so

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,759
much more information out there and and

00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:18,579
if you're hacked you can get access or

00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,149
you're going to be giving access to

00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:22,149
folks information

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,710
alright so we're going to talk about a

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,760
few common security myths and and the

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,870
the first one we're talking about that

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,580
you're too small be atariya so we're

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,010
looking at that big the infographic from

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,190
information is beautiful and go forward

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,450
in next one that had all of your like

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,400
all you know 60 million right how many

00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,560
of us like build websites with 60

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,690
million records right all right what

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,820
okay all right several of us okay but

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,740
most of us don't write and most maybe

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,350
most of the websites that we build don't

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,730
have that many records and so I think

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,930
it's kind of natural for people to think

00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,760
like I'm just too small to be a target

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,960
like why would they care about me that

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,960
is absolutely incorrect in fact you have

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,460
by virtue of having a website you have a

00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,470
number of assets one you have an

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,230
internet-connected computer that

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,270
computer can itself be used in further

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,310
attacks right it could be something in a

00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:20,070
change or it could be used like later on

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,140
as a botnet you also have visitors right

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,730
people go to your website they might be

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,839
using outdated or insecure browsers what

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,400
if they want to install something on all

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,760
of those people's you know those

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,339
vulnerable browsers you have proximity

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,500
to other systems like the mall sac

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:37,470
fonseca pack plausibly could have been

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,360
caused by vulnerabilities in either and

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,980
both WordPress and Drupal as well as a

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,920
come out a couple of other things like

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,870
it wasn't Drupal that had the all of the

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,640
information but it was Drupal as a first

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,900
and a change to another server and get

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,630
to the next server and all of a sudden

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,420
all of this information is exposed and

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,700
if you do have personally identifiable

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,900
information you do have credit card

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,000
information do you have other things

00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,220
that's a bonus but just those other

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,770
things in and of themselves our reason

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,080
for someone to target you and your

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,900
website and and one thing I just want to

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,150
add 2 to the quote I'm too small to be a

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,900
target a lot of hackers actually know

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,250
this and that's why they're not well

00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,470
actually why they're focusing on the

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,940
small and medium sized businesses they

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,430
know that the enterprise's are harder to

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,890
crack they have huge security teams and

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:29,160
how you know all the barriers in place

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,240
so and one thing to note is that a lot

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,130
of times people just go around knocking

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,180
on doors is what i like to call it and

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,500
they're just going around just tapping

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,840
tapping tapping and all of a sudden one

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,700
of them opens up so just put on the

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,950
and deadbolts if nothing else from this

00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,600
conversation you guys get is here are

00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,340
some dead bolts here's some ways that

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,280
you can protect your site because if you

00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,910
look at a hack like target the target

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:54,210
hack came from a small vendor that was

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,650
that was hacked they had a pipeline

00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,860
directly into the financial system of

00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:00,780
target don't ask me why and that allowed

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,980
a foot in the door that they then creeps

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,030
through their system got to the credit

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,450
card terminals and stole everyone's

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,010
credit cards so your seemingly small I

00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,530
think it was an air-conditioning vendor

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,120
in in New Jersey your seemingly small

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,660
website can all of a sudden become an

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:24,120
attack vector for a large multinational

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:25,890
corporation all right so we're going to

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,720
just roll into you know we're talking

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,460
about some miss here and we can just do

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,190
this one quick private businesses are

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,900
not regulated we also often talk to

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,870
businesses that fall under compliance

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,430
regulations and that's that's just false

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,530
oftentimes actually organizations fall

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,380
under multiple compliance raishin

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,320
regulations some of the common ones that

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,270
you might want to be asking your clients

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,870
if they fall under or even just what

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:54,000
industries there within for example PCI

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,520
DSS which is anyone that takes credit

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,340
cards you have HIPAA for people that are

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,160
in health care FFIEC for people in

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:05,160
banking fisma for government agencies

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,560
and FERPA for educational institutions

00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,030
and a lot of times the you know if

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,680
you're working with people within these

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,350
industries they might not necessarily

00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,810
think to say hey I fall under these

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,360
regulations but as Drupal shops and

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:21,360
rupal developers it's also I think a

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,950
little bit on on your shoulders to make

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,100
sure that you're setting up your clients

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,350
for success and meeting compliance the

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,880
next one that we often hear this is what

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,410
I hear a lot from our work in encryption

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,440
is that encryption is complicated it's

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,870
too difficult it's really not and part

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,430
of what we've been trying to do at least

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,020
with the suite of encryption modules

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,870
around Drupal is to make it dead simple

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,900
for someone to use and use properly and

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,150
so yes encryption itself is incredibly

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,669
difficult it's a complex mathematical

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,710
equation that basically if you took all

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:54,720
the energy output from the Sun in 32

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,609
years you would still only count to one

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,590
hundred ninety two bits and we're at 256

00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:59,970
bit so you can understand that

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,080
mathematically it's impossible to

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,220
brute-force a half of an encryption key

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,539
but someone's going to find that key and

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:12,269
so if you start looking at standards and

00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,489
and what is published out there as the

00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:16,470
recommended steps you'll find that there

00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:18,419
are some very clear steps to say this is

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,499
approved and recommended encryption

00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,059
methods these are approved and

00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:23,460
recommended key management methods and

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,529
if you follow those encryption can't can

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,720
be very easy to implement especially

00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:29,700
within the Drupal system and so a lot of

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,009
times people and and you know as a

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,899
developer I fall prey to this as well is

00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,580
that it's too complicated is there

00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:37,619
another way that I can do it and it at

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,210
times the answer should be no like you

00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:44,100
should should be encrypting that data

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:46,859
and and just briefly another myth that

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,159
we here security kills performance so it

00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:52,590
is true that tools like encryption have

00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,419
a performance cost but there are many

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,489
factors that affect the total system

00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,440
performance and in fact applications

00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:00,899
such as databases and all the major

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,580
operating systems have been tuned for

00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,970
decades to provide optimal performance

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,009
by minimizing the amount of time spent

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,799
going to disk so as long as encryption

00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:13,769
is implemented correctly overhead is

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,179
very very minimal and as a note from the

00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:18,149
the encryption modules that we're

00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:21,539
building in Drupal we've addressed this

00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:23,489
with you know memory-based key caching

00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:25,230
for the entire bootstrap of Drupal all

00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,429
these different stuff so if your

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,659
developers come to you and say hey I

00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,029
don't want to do encryption it's going

00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,710
to kill our site performance you can

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:35,399
kind of point them to this and say no it

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:37,320
really won't and the the last thing that

00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:40,259
we often hear is that clients aren't

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,109
paying me for security and no that's

00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:45,450
really wrong actually they're they're

00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:48,119
paying you for results like if you asked

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:51,080
your clients do you expect your website

00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,970
to be secure I bet they will all say yes

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,710
and and if you're not really sure about

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,450
that like what if the people look below

00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,340
you in the stack what if the you know

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,169
how would you feel like if your hosts or

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,669
the platform you're running on sort of

00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,080
felt the same way like

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,279
you know they're just doing drupal it

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,169
doesn't really need to be secure like

00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,730
that would be very alarming to you this

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:10,499
is the same assumption that your clients

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,570
bring to you right they are paying you

00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:14,609
for results and they don't you know like

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,779
they might not know the word CSS or it's

00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,879
not really word they might not know the

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,929
acronym CSS but they are paying you for

00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,309
it because that's one of the things that

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:25,080
you're delivering right security should

00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:26,100
be one of those things and if and it and

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,899
you know we'll be talking about this

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,179
actually quite a bit more but it's also

00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:32,909
a place to differentiate yourself if the

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,799
client is not educated about security if

00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:37,139
they're not asking for it in the RFP

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,359
maybe you can stand out from the crowd

00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:42,210
of people that are also replying to that

00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,369
and add a section and maybe you can

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,960
actually even add some price and add

00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,239
some stuff and then they're going to be

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,379
swell well you know we thought we had

00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:51,149
this much of a project but we're going

00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:53,129
to go with this you know a larger

00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:54,809
project for this better agency because

00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:56,730
wow they just taught us a lot about

00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,259
security and we know they're going to do

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,179
it right who are all the rest of these

00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:05,700
people and are they even thinking about

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:08,279
yeah exactly right all right and so big

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,659
takeaways here so hackers are in fact

00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,149
targeting small and mid-sized

00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,399
organizations compliance covers all

00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:16,470
industries you've got to build security

00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,600
of the sites clients should not have to

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,940
ask for it it's really not that hard and

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,019
so one thing we wanted to point out here

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,039
is that at the end of each of these

00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,330
sections that we're going to do we're

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,889
going to have a takeaway slide so that

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,389
way you guys don't have to feverishly

00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:28,769
write notes throughout it these are kind

00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,970
of the boil down bullet points and so

00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:32,399
we'll be doing these for each section

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,820
and then you can grab the slides later

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:40,830
online all right so we're going to get

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:42,539
into some security fundamentals we'll

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,749
just kick this off we'll start with the

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,999
the CIA triad not something we made up

00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:51,389
and also doesn't have to do with the

00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:53,340
actual CIA but it's a great way to

00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:56,039
educate yourself and think about all

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,429
aspects of security you should be

00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,220
focusing on them all not just one so

00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:06,299
what is CIA stand for confidentiality

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,970
integrity and availability think about

00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,659
confidentiality as the data that is

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,349
supposed to be protected

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:16,929
confidentiality is roughly equivalent to

00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:19,330
privacy encryption which we've talked a

00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:23,159
little bit about already is a common

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:26,139
method for ensuring confidentiality user

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,580
IDs and passwords constitute a standard

00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:29,649
procedure you should also be thinking

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,269
about two-factor authentication it's

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:33,609
becoming more of normal and you should

00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:38,320
also just really err on the side of more

00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:40,570
confidentiality integrity so this means

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,899
like only the people that should have

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,320
access to that data have access and

00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:49,720
availability make sure the site's all is

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,529
online make sure that you have high

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,940
availability in case something goes down

00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:57,659
there should be redundant resources

00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,279
serving up the infrastructure and

00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:02,259
something that may actually influence

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,769
availability just for like a real life

00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:07,720
example maybe like a DDoS attack which

00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:08,979
is a distributed denial-of-service it

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,599
basically means that somebody's going to

00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:13,259
be flooding your site near servers so

00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,419
hard that that server crashes and so

00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:19,059
this happened i believe it was last year

00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:22,389
with some of the online gaming platforms

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:24,129
PlayStation and Xbox both underwent DDoS

00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:26,700
attacks and were offline for for a

00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:29,109
couple of days of peace because of that

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,179
yeah they're not hacking data they're

00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:33,580
not stealing credit cards but they just

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,830
took down a major service and that cost

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,549
Microsoft and that cost Sony real

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,669
dollars in in not only having the

00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:45,309
service down but then also customer you

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,989
know trust and everything else so brand

00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:48,970
sentiment yeah so there's a whole bunch

00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:51,399
of different ways that that somebody can

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,049
hack your site or attack it that you

00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:54,820
need to be looking out for not just

00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,919
their going to grab a credit card data

00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,809
no and another piece of this is

00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:00,070
important to understand is that security

00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,710
is not something that's on or off it's

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:05,799
not it's not a binary it's not a yes/no

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,210
question it is more and less and there

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,340
are ways you can be more secure and ways

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,570
you can be less secure and hopefully by

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,070
tending this and you know like there's

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,830
there are other security sessions I

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,700
think we have there's watch the hackers

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,010
hack I think a little bit later on

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,130
and I think 345 today are you doing that

00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,000
one yeah okay so that's going to be put

00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,680
on by some of the members of the

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,390
security team you can see maybe some of

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,770
the techniques like sum of the forces of

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:32,930
evil and what they're up to but through

00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,360
that learn how to make your site more

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,190
secure and then educate yourself as to

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,020
what ways to make it even more secure

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,420
and that's a lot of the things so it's

00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:50,480
not it's not just on and off it's more

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:52,100
or less okay all right and so personally

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,720
sorry I wish you could see the screen

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,730
and that'd be really nice to know the

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,070
slide we're on sorry about that so

00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:01,610
personally identify an identifiable

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,930
information or PII is is as part of the

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,950
jargon so it's just something like if

00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,370
you haven't if you're not familiar with

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,630
the term asian you know be aware of that

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,700
again set yourself apart when you're

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,430
talking to your clients about PII bi is

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,960
is is any piece of information that can

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,610
be combined with something else to come

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,250
up with someone's identity so for

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:23,060
example phone numbers email addresses

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,260
date of birth those kinds of things can

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,890
be combined with another piece to sort

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,630
of like triangulate who a person is and

00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,310
sometimes depending on like Luke

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,660
mentioned a number of compliance models

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,100
will talk about some of those as we get

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,480
into some like column and case studies

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,780
about you know what small businesses

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,170
need and and education organizations as

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:45,980
such but sometimes those like pci or

00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,960
other frameworks can say like these are

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,790
the pieces of P I they so it can depend

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,270
on the the compliance regulations that

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,380
you need to meet another interesting

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,470
kind of game that we played in a

00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,730
previous talk that we did in Barcelona

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,700
we had everyone stand up and then we

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,770
asked three seemingly you know innocuous

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,840
questions from what would be assumed

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,300
from someone's facebook we did a glass

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,040
student in LA as well how many people

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,350
live east of the Mississippi how many

00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,630
people have a birthday in march and how

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,980
many people own a dog three things that

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,390
you would find on anyone's face book

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,310
page and we were able to take a room

00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,730
about 300 people and and whittle it down

00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,960
to three and so if you again if you

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,890
think that the information that you're

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,570
collecting is not sensitive it is if

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,110
you're collecting information on one of

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,580
your user

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,290
it is sensitive information because it

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,490
can be combined with others just one

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,870
other thing that I'd like to point out

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,490
drew was talking about the different

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,809
kinds of information that websites

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,540
collect you know phone numbers first

00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,309
name last name if you think about just

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,630
even the context of a lot of companies

00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,170
are collecting this information it

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:50,000
doesn't have to be like a like a health

00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,710
care account you know and it could just

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,660
be a marketing website thats collecting

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,240
information for a white paper but you

00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:00,350
now have all this PII for like a big

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,790
list of people so we got a couple of

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,790
great questions that are that are coming

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,260
in here one of them is if we have stats

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,140
around market perceptions sentiments

00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,669
towards open source security we can

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,830
definitely find some will tweet some out

00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,299
later one thing to note and one thing is

00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,890
you're talking with folks you're going

00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:17,690
to hear people say I don't want to use

00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,620
Drupal it's insecure it's open source

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:24,440
that's the opposite of what it what it

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,350
is really because an open source project

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,200
by nature has more eyeballs on it yes

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,820
the code is published but by the code

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,049
being published and more eyes on it you

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,299
actually end up with a more secure

00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:38,690
platform if i'm going to write something

00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,490
and i'm the only one who knows it I can

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,990
easily skip over something or a team of

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,270
five developers can easily skip over

00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,740
something but you have you know

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,030
wonderful people like the Drupal

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,220
security team that are constantly

00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,320
monitoring and every module that's

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,240
published on True Blood org is backed by

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,950
the security team and there are security

00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,980
fixes and there's there's protocols for

00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,950
all this so open source not secure not

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,960
true and the other one was about a DDoS

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,850
attack the way to protect yourself from

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,470
DDoS attacks has put something in front

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,970
of your website don't just have your

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,150
website be plugged directly into the web

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:14,840
and so I a good example of this is

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:17,720
pantheon aquia and a lot of the hosting

00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,400
providers all have layers and firewalls

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,740
in front that will detect that and then

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,440
shut off traffic CloudFlare is another

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:27,860
great one they are a DNS service that

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,870
will monitor traffic and as they detect

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,820
a DDoS attack elsewhere in the world or

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,950
on a different site they'll actually

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:37,790
prevent that IP from hitting your site

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,890
as well and so if you if you join either

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,510
hosting providers that are a larger

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,250
hosting provider not hosting it yourself

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,800
or you go

00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,230
you someone like cloudflare you can kind

00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,120
of benefit from the Internet at large as

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,620
one DDoS attack happens you'll be

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,540
protected from it as well and that

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,360
actually brings up our next quite well

00:29:52,540 --> 00:30:00,010
which is yeah Vince in depth so David

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,450
Strauss one of the Pantheon founders has

00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:05,050
this great term of don't build Death

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:08,500
Star security we've all seen hopefully

00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:12,070
this wonderful movie and the idea here

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,960
is that defense is not a perimeter

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,850
barrier we don't just build the Great

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,190
Wall and hope nobody jumps over it right

00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,480
we don't build a Death Star and leave an

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,030
exhaust port that's going to blow the

00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,830
whole thing up we want to make sure that

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,410
everything we do in security is layers

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,660
upon layers upon layers because when it

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,180
comes to defense in depth the more

00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,720
layers that you have in place the more

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,820
time it takes to jump and in hacking and

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,830
encounter hacking or addressing somebody

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,910
who's trying to attack your site it's

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:44,110
all about time how fast can you realize

00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,030
that somebody's hacking your site and

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,800
shut them off and then how long does it

00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,780
take for them to get through so if the

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,190
first couple steps are really easy but

00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,990
then they have a couple of larger walls

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,550
to jump over it's going to slow them

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,770
down and hopefully you have the the

00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:59,560
pieces in place to be able to detect

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,270
some of those those earlier breaches to

00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,580
prevent the deeper breaches from

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,590
occurring and so you can't just say well

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,120
I have password policy installed on my

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,230
drupal site so all my passwords are

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,750
secure I don't have to worry about

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,000
anything wrong there are so many

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,830
different vectors than just one and so

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,400
when you talk about security we talk

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:20,980
about defense it really is everything on

00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,420
the site but being here in the business

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,670
track we also have to think about it's

00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,200
everywhere in the company right it's not

00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,120
just the developers the developers

00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,730
aren't your only you know wall of

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,230
security and you're in your company you

00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,490
need to start thinking about the

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,620
marketing team the sales team the

00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,510
executive team everyone that's in the

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:43,240
room in the company has a role to play

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:45,820
in security so takeaways here there's no

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,300
magic bullet sorry we wish we could give

00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,650
you one but if you have a

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,740
defense-in-depth approach and you have

00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,320
these layers that are building up you're

00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,029
going to your

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,889
to be better off and then another thing

00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:59,799
is we always like to say if you don't

00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:02,419
have to collect it or store it don't

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,669
it's one good way of getting around

00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:06,830
having your site be the hub of all

00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:08,929
information that is going to be hacked

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,789
if you don't keep that information a lot

00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:14,600
of third-party vendors now are doing a

00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:15,799
really good job for instance stripe and

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,549
some of the other payment providers are

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:21,889
now allowing JavaScript libraries that

00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:23,120
you can send credit cards to them

00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:24,380
without ever having to go through your

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,990
servers well you've just reduced your

00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,350
PCI footprint considerably by doing that

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,440
if you're using a credit card processing

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:36,679
that goes through your website your pc i

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,519
burden becomes much larger and so rely

00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,539
on other folks if you can and so this is

00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,889
the heart of what we want to get to is

00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:45,590
that security is actually really good

00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:47,210
for your business and and not just good

00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,940
for your business from hey our websites

00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:55,490
up but from a dollars and cents point of

00:32:49,940 --> 00:33:00,080
view so first off stand out your

00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:02,330
proposals win more rfps if you're going

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,909
out and bidding on an RFP or you're

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,200
going out and putting out proposals

00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:07,490
you're going to be competing against a

00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,129
bunch of other people if you can stand

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,929
out in the crowd and have a clear

00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:13,549
outline of what security you're going to

00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:14,629
be implementing on that project and how

00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:16,309
you're going to be taking the steps

00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:18,500
maybe the security steps within your own

00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,539
company you're going to stand out from

00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,059
the crowd and as drew was mentioning

00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:24,529
earlier a lot of larger rfps will

00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,600
require security because they've been

00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:28,399
through a longer process internally and

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,720
they know they have security teams that

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,210
are going to say we require this this

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,830
and this so if you start implementing

00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,509
good security within your business and

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,500
within your development you'll actually

00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:38,210
be able to go out and start becoming

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:43,549
competitive at some of these larger rfps

00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:45,259
if not a great way to kind of add some

00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:46,580
extra juice to the the proposal and

00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:49,850
added some extra scope to what you're

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,139
doing is always add security in if

00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,340
somebody hasn't put it in be like hey

00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:55,399
we're going to do this this and this and

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,570
it's going to make you more secure I can

00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,429
almost guarantee you and as a business

00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,419
owner myself if somebody comes to me and

00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:00,710
says hey you're going to spend a little

00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:03,139
bit extra money but you're going to be

00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,600
more secure nobody's going to say no it

00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:08,090
just if you can make the clear point

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,560
that this tool will make you more secure

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,990
and because of that you'll be a better

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:16,100
business it's very hard for a business

00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:17,480
owner to say no to that the next thing

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,210
that we have to look at here is that you

00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,580
can actually be liable for a breach and

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,940
so this is kind of a cya thing as a deb

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:30,560
shop we had some internal banter about

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:32,450
this technically the breach from a

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,400
security standards point of view from

00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:37,310
HIPAA and pci and all those will fall on

00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,560
your client because they're there solely

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:43,070
responsible for their implementation of

00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,500
it but myself included and a lot of deb

00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,970
shops that we've talked to you have to

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,940
structure your contracts with your

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:52,400
clients to make sure that a that

00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,230
liability is is clearly defined and if

00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,680
it's not and all of a sudden they're hit

00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,660
with a 10 million dollar fine because of

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,890
this they could turn around and sue you

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,060
for 10 million dollars because you're

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,040
the one who implemented that if your

00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,870
contracts are correct you could be

00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,340
liable for that and and raise of hands

00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,480
how many people here could just walk out

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,750
with 10 million dollars out of their

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,640
business and be in business tomorrow

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:17,180
exactly so this is something that we

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,310
need to reduce the risk by implementing

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,410
the proper security that you have even

00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,780
if they don't ask for it again and even

00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,190
if you have to take on the cost yourself

00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,440
we've had to do it on a couple of

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,940
clients it's like look I know you're not

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,070
going to pay for this but I have to do

00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,440
this otherwise I just I'm opening myself

00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,890
up to too much liability here curiosity

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,630
here show of hands how many people

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,610
evaluate their contracts and what it

00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,310
actually says about security is this is

00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:49,850
this a big issue for you guys all right

00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:54,980
great great and so then also minimize

00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:56,810
your exposure to to sensitive data don't

00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,500
store passwords don't have clients send

00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,210
you passwords it just is bad I have

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,470
clients that will send me like root

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,330
passwords to your server and it's like

00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,830
great you just added 10 hours to scope

00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:10,250
because i have to go rebuild everything

00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,660
now so one of the things that we need to

00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,980
think about here is that as a business

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,800
and to make your business profitable

00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:17,270
from security is to minimize your

00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,830
exposure if you are going to be held

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,980
liable minimize what you're going to be

00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:24,340
held liable for

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,619
and in in in certain situations this

00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,240
means telling your client no and that's

00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,369
something that you as a developer and

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,740
you as a business can do it's actually

00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:33,940
possible you can tell your client no I'm

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,800
not going to do that and they'll

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,390
actually respect you for it and you can

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,250
bring up that dialogue of saying I'm not

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,050
going to do it and here's why I'm not

00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,000
going to do it I've had examples of this

00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,530
with clients where they've asked me to

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,500
build a certain database or a certain

00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,240
form and I'm like that's just not secure

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,980
I won't do that if you want to find

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,290
someone else that will great if you want

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:57,280
me to build another solution I will and

00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:59,260
so feel feel confident in saying no we

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,630
can stand up to a client and say no we

00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,369
don't want to collect that information

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:07,330
and then also you know this is a

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:08,740
burgeoning industry it's it's been

00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,510
around for a long time and it's becoming

00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,310
more and more prevalent as almost every

00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:17,430
business now has a website almost every

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:19,440
business is now exposed to an attack so

00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:23,050
start building a name for yourself

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,280
security is growing now that we have IOT

00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,900
you have the Internet in your

00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,080
refrigerator and your shoes and

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,820
everywhere else security is everywhere

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,900
now it's not just in your website and if

00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,550
you can become one of the leaders in

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,190
security you're going to start growing

00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,900
your business in ways that you you may

00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,950
not be right now how many how many of

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,359
you are interested in raising your

00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:44,290
hourly rates yeah right yeah if all of a

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,080
sudden you become the security

00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,550
professional you can do that and you can

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,440
you can kind of start you know raising

00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,710
your rates and becoming the security

00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,930
professional that comes in and helps out

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:59,859
and it builds trust and and as you guys

00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:02,830
well no as business owners and and and

00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:04,390
managers yourself is that if a client

00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,460
trusts you they're going to come back to

00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,720
you for more and more work you've turned

00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,730
that three-month project into a

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,230
three-year project and then they're

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,580
going to go talk to all their friends or

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,859
people that come to them in their

00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,570
network and so as you start building

00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,460
that trust of man these guys really

00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,619
saved my bacon we almost got attacked

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,790
but we didn't they're going to tell

00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:23,320
folks about that and your name is going

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,850
to start getting out there it one other

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,440
thing I just I just kind of thought

00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,109
about this

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,569
now is is you know I see a lot of people

00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:32,099
out here that maybe you're like well I'm

00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:34,460
not a security expert how am I supposed

00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:36,839
to make a security focused agency

00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,060
there's good thing is there's resources

00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:41,460
like you know us that you can then work

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,200
with and then we can help bolster your

00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,569
agency and have that bring that

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,760
expertise to your agency and you don't

00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:50,160
necessarily have to be a security expert

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,140
yourself or your company just bring in

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,819
those resources yeah and there's a ton

00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,530
of stuff I mean and you don't need to go

00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:57,990
to third parties this a ton of stuff you

00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:01,740
like just spend time learning it make it

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:03,240
a priority absolutely tons and tons of

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,579
tons of resources so couple of questions

00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,050
that have come in do any of the tools

00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,670
that you mentioned report breach

00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,920
attempts with in Drupal itself or they

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,810
platform-specific the beauty of having

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,880
platforms and and I can speak this from

00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,290
not being from pantheon the beauty of

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,750
having platforms such as Pantheon or

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:21,030
knock way and the rest is that this is

00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:23,460
happening constantly if you're on them

00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,660
your site is being d dost right now you

00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,130
just don't know it and it's being

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,000
protected because somebody else is

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:32,640
worrying about it for you there are

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,109
there's a hack module for Drupal that

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,990
you can install and it'll kind of run

00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:39,569
through some of the basic you know known

00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:42,270
hacks a good example of this was after

00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:43,319
Drupal gettin there was a great tool

00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,480
that you could just run down all your

00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:47,430
sites and say or any of these breached

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,079
from this and these are the known ways

00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,670
that people were getting into it and and

00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,579
provide those and we can provide you

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,540
guys with a list of those later as well

00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:55,920
another question is why you speak about

00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,810
all the personal data be important to

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,310
protect such as do you have a dog what

00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,810
do you say about sites with rich public

00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:04,859
user profiles where this data isn't

00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:06,690
exposed intentionally personally I don't

00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:09,800
like to expose a lot of that data I

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:13,099
choose you have a choice as a user to

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,180
put out into the world what you want

00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:18,920
some people would put more some people

00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:22,079
will put less and then as that site

00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,579
builder you have to think it is is the

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,920
benefit of this being in a public

00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:28,650
profile worth the risk of it being

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,510
exposed and that's something you have to

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,190
weigh on a time by time basis i'm not

00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,319
going to critique anyone's one site

00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:38,430
would you say by default to make your

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:42,150
site https yes yes yes yes yes yes

00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:45,059
ezio benefits yeah so Google's now up up

00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:48,900
ranking people that are using ssl which

00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:51,599
is awesome SSL is now free with let's

00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,579
encrypt so you don't have to pay these

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,170
four or five hundred dollars a year for

00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,150
a security certificate you can actually

00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:00,270
go get them for free now if you don't

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:03,869
want to do that cloudflare we brought

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:06,900
them up earlier as a dns protection tool

00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:08,940
they also now allow for secure relaying

00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,710
so basically they sit between your user

00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,359
in your site and provide that ssl

00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:16,819
connection so at this point the cost of

00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:19,530
securing your site with HTTPS is so

00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:23,250
minimal and sometimes free that there's

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:24,660
no excuse not to and then the last one

00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,460
is are there any tools available for

00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,829
securing sending credentials to clients

00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:32,400
and partners I like 1password there's

00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:34,200
password manager tools laughs pass all

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,910
of those have the ability to invite

00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,740
people into your organization you can

00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,410
share passwords it's all encrypted and

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:43,920
you're protected and how you send

00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:47,099
passwords that's how I like to do it and

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,290
in every every employee that's on board

00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,790
at our company instantly gets password

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,109
or one password installed on their

00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,540
computer and it's like you will start

00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,920
using this immediately and and I always

00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,559
tell people the best passwords you have

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,490
are the ones you don't know so yeah so

00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,010
those are some of the questions there

00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,780
you know so we've got also just like

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,280
note to ourselves here you got 15

00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,290
minutes left yeah so we're going to run

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,579
we've got a few things towards the end

00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,869
of this deck though we have some very

00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,549
specific doable modules that we

00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:13,589
recommend some stuff about securing

00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:15,119
Drupal very specifically so if you're

00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:16,710
looking ahead looking at the slides

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,450
online again you go to the the note on

00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,510
the world is site yeah and we'll just

00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:24,690
jump a couple of slides here this quote

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,280
here is is really a particular it says

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,010
everyone has the right to the protection

00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:34,440
of personal data and this is coming from

00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:35,910
an EU mandate Europe is I leaps and

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,799
bounds ahead of us right now in terms of

00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,839
how they're protecting their users and

00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:40,799
the public in general and I think you're

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,480
going to start seeing this trickle down

00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:43,710
into the US as well and this is

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,190
something we need to be watching and

00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:49,410
looking for is that data privacy is now

00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,260
not just a good thing to have it's a

00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:54,800
right and that

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,750
opening you up to you know a whole range

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,120
of things from lawsuits and everything

00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,010
else if you infringe on that right and

00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,570
this this slide and the prior one we're

00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,450
not going to go too in depth but the

00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,620
gist of what we wanted to convey here is

00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,870
compliance requirements and regulations

00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:12,440
are evolving it's not just like your pc

00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:14,240
is any more people are new organizations

00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,960
there's continually guidance that's

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:21,050
being updated so takeaways here win more

00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,790
projects with larger projects security

00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:27,500
can be more tools in your tool belt

00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:30,380
protect your business by protecting your

00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:35,540
clients and grow your business in the

00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:38,090
process all right so in the process so

00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,910
you go through a process in either in

00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,380
proposal stage or in discovery there are

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,180
number of questions that you really can

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,700
you should focus in and ask your clients

00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,840
about so things like what information is

00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,660
going to be collected who's going to

00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,280
have logins anything being sold in

00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,200
donations like and it's sort of like

00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,430
have those parts of the conversations

00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,020
those you doing sales those you're doing

00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,030
project scoping make sure that these

00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,190
kinds of questions are in there and if

00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:04,550
you hear any of these words along the

00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:08,720
way e-commerce donations integration

00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:11,060
api's registered users pay wall or any

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,310
just forms in general like these are

00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,200
places to like sort of like perk up Oh

00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,640
interesting I'm going to note this like

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,950
and again like if you're sort of on this

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,780
journey of learning security and you

00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,280
know you don't have your not you don't

00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,900
feel confident yet and being a security

00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,760
expert you'll bring this back to the

00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,200
person with the organization who is sort

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,210
of like how they mentioned this you know

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,560
make sure you sort of track these is

00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:34,550
like key places to focus and you know

00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,950
we've really already talked about this

00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,630
so oh no these are the dig out there are

00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,510
there ways yeah so yeah that's why we

00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,400
have talked about all right sopia so use

00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,930
discovery to cover security concerns and

00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,230
dig in deeper on those on those trigger

00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:49,820
words and so in your business and as you

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,290
start growing your dev team and just

00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,900
within the marketing and sales that you

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:56,570
do it's important to create a culture of

00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,730
security not just a line item of

00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,500
security and so every person on the team

00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,090
is responsible for their part to be

00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,510
secure whether it's a developer whether

00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:07,510
it's marketing whether it's your c-suite

00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:10,450
matter who where they need to be

00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,650
thinking about security I know I've

00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,900
worked at companies in the past where

00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,910
it's like all of a sudden the CEOs like

00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,110
hey I've here's my email password can

00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,060
you log in and help me with this issue

00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:20,920
it's like no I can't and you just

00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,080
screwed over my day because I have to

00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,930
reset your passwords and all this so

00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,820
every person no matter if they're

00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:30,520
touching the code or not is responsible

00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:32,200
for their portion of it so sales and

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,910
marketing make sure you use services and

00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,790
tools that have been vetted for security

00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:40,110
payment gateways cloud storage use

00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:42,970
things like box box is a really cool

00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:44,500
encryption now that allows you to even

00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,600
bring your own key so you're the one

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,550
encrypting it with your own key which

00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,010
makes it extra secure for those of you

00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,210
that are working in large enterprises

00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:55,060
payment gateways all of those are stuff

00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:57,010
that you should not be touching any of

00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,740
that and so leave it to the people who

00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:01,240
who can the website responsibility more

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,830
and more is falling under marketing so

00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,570
have your marketing team know about

00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:07,030
website security and a general sense and

00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:09,580
what to look for and when in doubt don't

00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:12,010
post it this includes internal memos

00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,210
external blog posts all that type of

00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:16,860
stuff think about what you're posting

00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:21,400
out and is it going to be creating a

00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,960
vector for attack and then one of the

00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,580
things that and this is what we kind of

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,590
deal with in doing a lot of security is

00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,740
that stay away from the fud the fear

00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:32,320
uncertainty and doubt it really kind of

00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,330
boils this it's primal to us all and so

00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,700
we all kind of react to it and it's not

00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,620
in a good way and what I like to say is

00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,420
rather than using fud you use it

00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,280
security as an empowerment tool like

00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:44,170
we're going to make you more secure and

00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,120
by doing that you're going to be better

00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,860
rather than coming in and being like ah

00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,690
if you don't do this you're going to be

00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:51,940
hacked and you'll lose millions of

00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:55,810
dollars and all that good stuff fud just

00:46:51,940 --> 00:47:01,570
doesn't feel good for for a lot of folks

00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:04,480
so for the dev team allow time for them

00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:07,300
to spend researching and learning about

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,610
it don't just push your dev so hard that

00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,530
they just can't think about security do

00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,240
regular code audits so have other folks

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,150
in the company look over the code that's

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,460
being created more eyes equal more

00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:22,089
more security this is why open source is

00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,740
good an award and recognized failures

00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,359
caught by the team I a quick antidote

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,520
that I really like is that Google has a

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,809
division that doesn't all their

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,539
experimental stuff and they actually

00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:33,369
award failure they will give out awards

00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:35,319
they will give out bonuses based on your

00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:38,170
project failing and I think that's a

00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:40,390
really interesting take two on business

00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,180
is that if something fails you are

00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,369
protecting profits and margins in the

00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,680
future and so if somebody on your team

00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:50,289
finds a bug in someone else's code don't

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,640
just be like Oh quick it you know fix it

00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:53,500
quick and let's just not talk about that

00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,539
again bring it up celebrate it be like

00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,700
hey good job you fixed that you saved us

00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,440
now let's go let's go to the next one I

00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:03,160
think that's an important culture to

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,720
build and also involved the development

00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,750
team in the proposal process I know this

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,329
sounds very you know basic but at times

00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,470
it's like I will get a proposal as a

00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:13,359
developer sometimes and I'll get a

00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,430
proposal or hey we just landed this

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:18,250
project here you go and it's like I had

00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,750
no idea what is going on here and if I

00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,359
did I would have changed five different

00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,890
things so just because the development

00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:27,190
team is working on this portion of the

00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:30,130
of the project give them access to more

00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:31,900
of it so that they can tell you about

00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:34,180
different security concerns there so

00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,250
practical tips we've run through some of

00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:39,400
these already use password managers to f

00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:43,270
a two-factor authentication so text you

00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,640
a login password that type of stuff keep

00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:47,079
your internal external Wi-Fi separate if

00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,760
you are going to provide a guest access

00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:49,869
so that way your guests don't just save

00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,180
your password and all of a sudden

00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:53,650
they're on your your network forever and

00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,710
then do regular security audit

00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:58,630
discussions memos create that culture of

00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,339
conversation around security and don't

00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:03,250
just have it be this taboo word that you

00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:05,200
just don't want to discuss right so

00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,599
takeaways everyone's responsible

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,789
communicate is key and encourage it

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,410
learn from your failures it's okay to

00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:13,630
fail we will all have a site that will

00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:16,119
be hacked and it's more of how do you

00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,770
react to it and how do you use that to

00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,829
make yourself and your team and your

00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:22,539
company better and then also you're

00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:24,549
being more secure makes me more secure

00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:26,680
so focus on security and well be well be

00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:30,030
good

00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:32,320
okay just going to cruise through these

00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:35,350
pretty quickly here as a security

00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:38,260
company we see a lot of people coming to

00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:40,540
us two for two two primary reasons one

00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:44,740
to meet compliance requirements and the

00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:46,870
other to manage risk we're going to look

00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:50,350
at kind of three case studies here or

00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:53,140
small business enterprise and higher ed

00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:55,570
and you know the interesting thing about

00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,840
these is they all have similar

00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:02,050
requirements and we'll just go through

00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,870
here pretty quickly I they all usually

00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:09,280
integrate other services like whether

00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:11,410
it's a paypal or MailChimp there's API

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,750
keys associated with that and so the

00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,880
security best practice as well as

00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:18,430
oftentimes encryption key security best

00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,610
practice is to always keep those keys

00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:23,620
separate from think that your website or

00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:26,350
your encrypted data that way if a hacker

00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:31,180
breaks into your site they don't have

00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:33,490
the keys to the kingdom talked with some

00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,530
people if you're on last year they were

00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,260
just doing crazy stuff and like have you

00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,700
could tell when they had the aha moment

00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,250
they're like yeah we I work for this big

00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,830
company we in a media company and people

00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:48,940
submit forms online because I want to be

00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:53,890
on a reality show go ahead he's read

00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:56,050
protected so lot lots of just kind of

00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:59,950
cruise through here you got encryption

00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:02,530
keys API keys higher read those are just

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:04,930
it's a total ecosystem how many folks

00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:06,670
here from the higher ed we tend to have

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,680
quite a bit of folks great so you got

00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,420
you have probably wellness centers so

00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,450
people fall under HIPAA you have

00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:16,270
bookstores so you fall under PCI your

00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,560
higher end so you fall under FERPA you

00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:21,619
gotta got to think about all these

00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:27,150
compliance rings so let's

00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:29,640
they're so two takeaways here you know

00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:32,160
they all have similar concerns sites

00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,560
large and small there's a lot of modules

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,800
and services that can help and security

00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,930
is a good business investment a couple

00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,460
of questions that have come up here how

00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,160
do you handle the current United States

00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,220
government push to weaken the RSA it's

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,720
horrible anyone that is in the security

00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,610
industry will tell you that this is

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,890
Pandora's box that we do not want to

00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:54,600
open if you want to go on Twitter rant

00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,430
later with me or if you want to in

00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,070
person over a couple of beers i will

00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:01,820
talk your ear off on this topic the site

00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:04,920
for free SSL is let's encrypt and

00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,720
CloudFlare would you say that SSO is

00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,150
better in terms of security yes because

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,950
you're having one source of truth rather

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:14,010
than having passwords in multiple places

00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:16,310
so using google using facebook and some

00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:18,840
of these other ones to allow your your

00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:22,020
users to login to your site is a good

00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:24,840
thing and then we'll go through we'll go

00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:26,820
through some of these four for the how

00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,850
to test for modules are the hacked

00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:34,470
modules and those and there's actually

00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:37,020
some yeah we'll get into some other ones

00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:38,790
here real quick and samuel if your

00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,700
entire i'd probably yeah samuel table

00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,200
yep SSO meeting single silent so one of

00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,270
the things like if the in those case

00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,760
studies it was like you know what should

00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:50,070
you focus on the you know starting with

00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,480
a small business they've got they need

00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,340
the hosting the secure they need drupal

00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,290
secure they need some API keys secure

00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,940
and then if you're bigger you need that

00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:58,650
plus more plus more plus more one of the

00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,020
things that's a piece in that is

00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:03,090
constantly is hosting here we are a

00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:05,130
drupalcon her a drupal we like drupal

00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:07,350
it's a good thing if you're looking for

00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:09,210
a host and you want to find a good

00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,190
hosting provider you should start at the

00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,600
drupal.org page for hosting because

00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,730
these are organizations i care enough to

00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,690
put money back into drupal and support

00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:20,430
in that way in preparing for this talk

00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,920
however like sort of realize that that

00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,260
page starts off with a class of hosts

00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,609
called shared hosting and probably

00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,600
proclaiming like sort of blinking

00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:32,460
numbers like 295 that's not going to be

00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,390
really great for security unfortunately

00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,820
so

00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,800
that perspective you'd be very very

00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,500
careful of shared security and i'm just

00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,120
going to unscripted ask the drupal

00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,450
security team member here in the

00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,710
audience without impugning specific to

00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,770
organizations do you recommend secure

00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:52,710
shared hosting no that is a head shake

00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:54,150
of know so what am I one of my favorite

00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:56,790
quotes that that drew said in the past

00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:59,730
is if your site is worth more than 295

00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,990
pay more than 2 95 for hosting yeah and

00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:04,950
that's just something to think about

00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:07,560
yeah yeah so again like it's complex

00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,690
there's a lot of stuff out there we're

00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,130
short on time I would have be happy to

00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:14,520
sort of discuss this at a much greater

00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:16,530
length cloud architecture though is it's

00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,900
sort of like the new there's a better

00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:20,010
way to do hosting and Pantheon is

00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,840
certainly an example of this in the

00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,510
Drupal space there are others Heroku

00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,040
other kinds of you know a different sort

00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:28,470
of philosophy in the way that you deploy

00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,330
computers and keep them secure and again

00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:34,560
happy to discuss that at greater length

00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:36,090
but let's go ahead so if you're looking

00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:40,350
for a secure host start on drupal.org

00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:43,860
but don't do the shared hosting kind and

00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:46,400
add some add some security questions to

00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,900
an evaluation of a host for example

00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,580
Drupal gettin big big big security

00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,930
problem about a year and a half ago and

00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,250
if they don't if the host doesn't have a

00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:58,020
story about like oh yeah we were able to

00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,370
you know like do this and here we go and

00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,720
we were protected and we saw the tax

00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,000
start rolling in later they don't have a

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,280
story like that you should like whoa red

00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,240
flag that likewise things like Hartley

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,290
there are lots of kinds of

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,890
vulnerabilities happening constantly

00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:13,650
being exposed and the platform you know

00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,940
I'm the just like again to architecture

00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,200
because of the way the Pantheon works

00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,680
what's what happens that we're able to

00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,020
change that once and then float across

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,430
the entire infrastructure is powering

00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,710
hundreds of thousands websites billions

00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:27,750
of page views and we you know a couple

00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:31,599
engineers the way it should work

00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:34,509
computers it boom all good

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:38,460
yeah so we're going to kind of combine

00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:40,569
these these next couple pieces together

00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,400
again the slides are going to be posted

00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:44,170
this is one of the hard topics about

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,339
securities you just start getting really

00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:47,410
passionate about it and you can talk

00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:48,749
forever on it I'm so come find us later

00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,789
and we'll talk to you more about it but

00:55:48,749 --> 00:55:53,109
there are some great references here for

00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:56,200
how to secure Drupal these are some

00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:57,579
great tips some modules like we

00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,839
mentioned earlier and there'd been some

00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:04,989
questions about and so take a look at

00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:09,640
those everything from encryption to key

00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:12,640
management login security because we're

00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:16,599
here at drupalcon in Drupal 8 was just

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,979
released Drupal 8 is the most secure

00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:22,509
version of Drupal to date it is

00:56:19,979 --> 00:56:24,609
incredible advancement here from a

00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:27,940
business side Drupal 6 is end of life

00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:29,380
which means that it's a great

00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,150
opportunity for you as businesses to

00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,099
start going out and doing these

00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,390
migrations from d six to DEA and in that

00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:37,299
you can start mentioning hey we're going

00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:39,969
to push you to a more secure platform as

00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:42,430
many of you that have looked at the code

00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:44,049
on d6 sites a lot of it is really nasty

00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,769
and it's just because we had to do what

00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:50,319
we had to do and so upgrading it and and

00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:52,900
as you upgrade fix those pieces don't

00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,819
just do a straight port from d6 to d8

00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,229
take a step back and look at what you're

00:56:54,819 --> 00:57:00,880
doing and say can we do this better can

00:56:56,229 --> 00:57:02,289
we do it more secure yeah so core isn't

00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,599
an island anymore again the whole open

00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:06,039
source is more secure theory here more

00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:08,019
eyes on the project more people around

00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:10,420
it no PHP in core which is awesome

00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:12,309
because now if somebody hacks your site

00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,989
and gets access to user 1 they can't

00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:18,640
just enable PHP and start running for

00:57:13,989 --> 00:57:21,339
for the hills with it you know your

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,160
theme layer is actually very insecure in

00:57:21,339 --> 00:57:25,900
Drupal 6 in Drupal 7 and so you'll hear

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,749
a lot about twig and that's a big

00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,789
security advancement there and so then

00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:33,460
also you got opportunities like i said

00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:36,069
earlier to upsell and then the whole API

00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,529
piece that Druce was talking about today

00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:39,930
you're now opening Drupal up to more

00:57:38,529 --> 00:57:41,619
places you're going to have more

00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:44,200
vulnerabilities when you start

00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:45,190
introducing this API layer it's things

00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,530
to start thinking about how

00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:53,109
you access and manage control to the

00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:56,770
data so takeaways Drupal 8 is leaner

00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:59,109
newer faster better upgrade now and and

00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:03,640
you'll expand your projects in your

00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:06,609
scope by doing so all right so in

00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,500
conclusion so just to like you and your

00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:09,940
clients are all targets there is a

00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,160
business value to security there's a lot

00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:13,630
there you start building security into

00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,390
your processes and culture and proposals

00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:19,210
can we go back smile and end into your

00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:21,490
billing add the line items for it use

00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:23,650
the secure hosting provider and improve

00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,030
Drupal security with some configuration

00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,859
modules and again those specific ones we

00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,990
listed are on the slides that the module

00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:31,750
pages have a great overview of them so

00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:39,339
thank you we went long yeah sorry about

00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:41,380
that one more question that popped up in

00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:43,150
here somebody's building a distro for d

00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,109
8 and they want to encrypt a lot of it

00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:46,119
but they don't want to own their keys

00:58:44,109 --> 00:58:48,220
come talk to us luke and i can tell you

00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:50,650
about keys all day long and if there's

00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:53,470
any questions I mean we're technically

00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,730
over so if you want to ask a real quick

00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,990
question of the mic you can or you can

00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,359
just come up and talk to us and yeah
