Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Get off the island! But build bridges back
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Come learn how we built a completely independent PHP library with the express intent of then using it with Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 modules at the same time. We're excited to share our experience with the wider Drupal community!

We believe this is a great way to be able to innovate and integrate with the wider PHP world but keep a firm footing within the Drupal world.

Our motivation was to have a solid library (in our case dealing with booking and availability management) that we could use across Drupal versions and potentially within any PHP project. We will discuss how we architected the library and how we designed our Drupal modules to take advantage of it. Finally we will touch on how we started with a prototype Drupal 8 module, ported some of those ideas back to Drupal 7 and then returned to complete the Drupal 8 version! This allows us to offer the capabilities of the library to the hundreds of thousands of existing Drupal 7 sites as well as new Drupal 8 sites being created.
