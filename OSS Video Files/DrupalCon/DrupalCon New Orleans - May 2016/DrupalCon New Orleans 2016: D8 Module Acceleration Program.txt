Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: D8 Module Acceleration Program
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Last year Acquia commited $500k to porting modules to D8 through the Module Acceleration Program. This will be a panel discussion led by the developers on the challenges and successes of the program. We will also cover the functionality we have been able to bring to D8 with the 40+ modules that have been ported and where you can use them in your projects including:

Panels, Panelizer, Chaos Tools, Page Manager
Workbench moderation 
Workspace Preview System
Search API and other search modules
and many more!
 There will be a long question time at the end to give you a chance to ask about architectural decisions that have been made and the future direction of the program.

This should be accessable to all levels, but even advanced developers should get alot out of the deep discusion of D8 development patterns

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
so my name is John Kennedy I'm the

00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:08,099

to accelerate the Drupal 8 module

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,390
ecosystem about reporting on creating

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,279
new modules to drive a Drupal adoption

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,130
will have a lot of time in this session

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,360
if you'd asked some questions about

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,250
about the challenges they faced about

time Drupal contributor and now I'm

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:41,370
business side so interesting perspective

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,690
that kennel ring so I'm a product owner

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:50,320
but I can to know Larry Garfield been

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,390
around rupal forever this stuff we

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,120
talked about here was when i worked at

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,640
palantir net with ken i just recently

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,790
moved to platform sh it's a hosting

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,560
company see i'm just talking about code

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,489
that's most of what i was doing for this

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,049
initiative and i'm adam balsam I work

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,630
for Acquia I'm the tech lead for

00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,040
lightning and I helped organize this

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,470
module acceleration program at John

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,090
great so I'm going to talk really

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,459
briefly about on the purpose for the

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,350
initiative because what we found we

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,269
looked and this actually is a set of

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,010
functionalities from Forrester who are

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,780
an analyst they look at web content

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,060
management systems but we looked at

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,610
these capabilities on left you see

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,200
what's provided by Drupal core but on

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,810
the right you see all the things that

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,549
have to be provided by the module

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,340
ecosystem at least until we bring them

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,660
into core and so that really puts you

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,459
know a lot of responsibility on the

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,590
ecosystem to put out these features for

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:48,190
Drupal 8 so that people have a full and

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,459
rich experience with Drupal so you know

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,250
recently as three said in his keynote he

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,220
did a survey and what did he find is the

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,920
top reason people weren't coming to d8

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,140
modules you know they needed to feel

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,209
that modules were in a state they could

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,560
use in production they have the

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,370
capabilities they needed to build

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,799
digital experiences so you know we had a

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,880
mission in October and now this really

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,370
kicked off

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,040
with the authoring summit that we had

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,600
over a bad can we gather a lot of people

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,000
together to talk about authoring

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,040
experiences and modules and you know

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,220
what was required to bring people into

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,050
Drupal 8 and you know the the mission

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,770
through the module acceleration program

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,510
which was to drive jubilate adoption to

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,110
engage the module contributors and to

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,780
build a better Drupal so a queer put the

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,390
money forward you know they put forward

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,960
we put forward five hundred thousand

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,510
dollars thank you Tom to go directly to

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,520
contributors you know we as I said

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,920
before we we went out to bad camp

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,350
another number of other places too to

00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,510
engage the community and we also

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,240
supported this development with

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,590
resources from our quia that was a part

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,380
of our professional services department

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,030
and also adam Bassam who's the technical

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,560
lead and coordinated the whole program

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:15,010
from a technical standpoint so you know

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,770
after six months we've got over 4,000

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,780
hours of developer time in the program

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,420
we've got over 10 contributing agencies

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,940
who couldn't necessarily be represented

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,040
here all of them are in Europe in as you

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,940
can see over six countries over twenty

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,680
developers and we've released over 36

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,470
production-ready modules and generally

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,120
they're the tough ones there there big

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,010
hard modules that we knew were going to

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,780
be really hard to accomplish for a

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,700
single developer and it made sense to

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,450
try and develop them as a part of it a

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,710
group effort so maybe Adam you can take

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,350
up the mic and just talk really briefly

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,060
about how we could coordinate it across

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,790
a lot of different modules that being

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,650
developed independently by groups of

00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,390
people yeah this is our Trello board

00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,800
that we use to just kind of give it like

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,420
a general overview of where we're at

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,010
with all of our modules so first of all

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,650
we identified what modules belong down

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,090
here and then we built our team out and

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,490
some of the people that we brought on

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,020
were very specific Larry he worked

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,000
primarily on workbench moderation

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,080
just a module that he already owned he

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,220
actually inherited some of that work

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,319
from somebody else for the Drupal 8

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,919
version but then there was other things

00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,720
that we didn't necessarily have somebody

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,580
in mind when we knew that we had to port

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,349
it so it was really a matter of figuring

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,599
out personalities and where the

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,419
expertise lied who prefer to work on a

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:34,060
team who preferred to work individually

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:36,580
and you know throughout that if somebody

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,800
like wampie who came to us from lullaby

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,560
I think he touched well over a dozen

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,789
modules not necessarily you know porting

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,409
them straight through Drupal 7 a Drupal

00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,580
8 but without and they probably know

00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,710
there was issues of would have language

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,659
that needed review then you had people

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,050
like Larry who worked primarily just on

00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,789
one module and then people like Ted and

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,919
bounced around but you know ultimately

00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,030
you know developed entire modules so it

00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,169
was really a matter of like finding the

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,770
right personalities and the right

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:05,370
technical chops and you know letting

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,750
letting people kind of direct their own

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,699
destinies I don't think people would

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,190
have appreciated you know saying you

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,289
know I wouldn't have asked David who is

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,599
very involved in the panel's ecosystem

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,159
to work on workbench moderation so

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,349
people kind of migrated to what they do

00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:22,599
best and really worked out well yeah and

00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:25,630
this was a lot about people who wanted

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,669
to develop their modules they wanted to

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,889
do the ports but they didn't have the

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,020
time or they couldn't justify it and we

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,719
brought them together and then there are

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,419
also people who came in like dick and

00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:39,819
Tim who had projects and donated their

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,219
time so fives have donated time and me

00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,930
the end and I'm novation donated time

00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,969
into the program because they had their

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,279
own problems they were solving and we

00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:50,229
could help them with that as well

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,120
contribute to their effort in some ways

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:54,610
and they were contributing to ours as

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,740
well and that it really grew the effort

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,319
out beyond who we were funding directly

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,529
to parties who wanted to collaborate and

00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:05,770
you know we ended up Adam with with a

00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:07,719
few externals we we kind of had the the

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,860
daily scrum but also we had an external

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,750
meeting that was happening every week

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,009
right that's important to note yeah so

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,330
what we started doing is we picked a

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:18,159
time that people in Switzerland India

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,039
and the East Coast and Oklahoma could

00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,310
all make so every day we got together 10

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,040
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,350
my time in Boston's may have been done

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,510
45 p.m. for some other people that were

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,190
involved in the project but every day we

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,350
made it a point that we all got together

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,210
and talked for at least 15 minutes that

00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,070
was our daily standup I think it was

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,110
really useful you know a lot of times it

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,970
was yeah I'm still working on it they're

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,970
just really good to touch base every day

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,470
and then on Tuesdays what we did is we

00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,000
call that our external scrum so

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,700
everybody came to our daily meetings

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,370
came to tuesday we also invited you know

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,650
some managers and then some other

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,790
organizations that are doing similar

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,500
acceleration efforts so maybe they were

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,270
working on projects related or not

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,130
related but it was a good time to bring

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,220
everybody together and say you know

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,900
we're picking up the D maps module so

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,720
don't anybody else worry about that or

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,310
we need help with this maybe somebody

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,810
could jump in and review an issue for

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,940
them or something so at Tuesday's we

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,740
kind of had our bigger meeting that we

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,450
caught everybody up and every day we

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,160
tried to keep it quick our stand-up at

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,130
ten-fifteen and that seemed to be really

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,740
productive was really really a useful

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,780
good use of time right so I just wanted

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,910
to mention you know as a as part of this

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,610
effort was to get d8 going and now we're

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,020
seeing a large adoption of d8 and Drew's

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,120
talked about it in his keynote but now

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,050
we're seeing large companies cannot come

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,690
on to d8 you know a lot of sites

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,840
reporting on d dodo a lot of sites on on

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,760
our queer platform that we can measure

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,260
you know and and we think that the

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,940
module acceleration program has been a

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,830
part of that and some of the reason we

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,560
believe that is we look at the top 12

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,680
modules that we built as a part of the

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,800
the program and we see big adoption of

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,930
those modules between january and april

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,150
you know we launched in october we

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,670
probably started releasing modules in

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:12,880
january and we've seen you know a lot of

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:14,230
adoption of those modules since then so

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,140
we're going to go to questions now and

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:20,680
this is the real that's the real point

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,690
of of the discussion because i think the

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,140
point today is that we want to enable

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,690
people to to form groups as we did with

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,670
in the program and go after these these

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,100
initiatives that the jury's is talking

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,180
about and self organized and get more

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,760
modules ported

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,260
more functionality into da you know and

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,420
these guys have had on-the-ground

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,190
experience of how to self coordinate and

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,120
you know they've set up subgroups around

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:48,910
things like workflow and you know that's

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,620
been really successful so you know I'd

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,270
like the developers on the panel maybe

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,270
to pick out a question they would like

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,070
to answer and we'll go down and we'll go

00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,230
post my person if you want to raise your

00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:06,850
hand we can pass the microphone across

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:11,230
and guys so there's Larry for the record

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:14,130
I worked primarily on workbench

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,320
moderation absa did some work with the

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,690
workspaces and multi version modules as

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,000
well for crunch moderation is a module

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,470
that palantir developed originally for

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,149
Drupal 7 and we knew we wanted to redo

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,950
it for drupal aids there had been

00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,670
changes in Drupal 8 that made it a lot

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:36,520
easier to build even just some minor

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,380
changes in the core IP is that took out

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,330
several thousand lines of terrible ugly

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,450
code from the Drupal 7 version of the

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,390
module probably the biggest question we

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,180
had the answer that way and they're hard

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,170
decisions was in Drupal 7 we had two

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,140
different versions of work bench

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,750
moderation we had the workbench 1x

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,100
branch which was basically you know

00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,790
you're straightforward build a couple of

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,320
states that you know assign them to

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,900
nodes and moderate them and you're done

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,540
and then a two decks branch that was

00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,339
trying to be a much more robust kind of

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:14,110
workflow engine type thing that for

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,380
various reasons never fully solidified

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,870
and the question for Drupal 8 was all

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,829
right wish to approach to retake do we

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:26,410
want to do the 75% use case that we can

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,120
nail pretty straightforward but doing so

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,120
not be able to get to that last ten

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,970
percent maybe the middle 15 I could do

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,149
math or do we try and get to the ninety

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,620
percent with the one module do we you

00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:40,120
know do that seventy seventy-five

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,640
percent version and then hope that's

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,020
tying into multi version the workspace

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,420
that other fifteen percent will just

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,480
kind of

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,000
on its own and we went around on that

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,750
for actually even pre map we were having

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,329
a discussion internally and tried taking

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,889
one approach didn't quite work finally

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,320
with map we were talking about it all

00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:04,070
right we'll take this junior approach

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,519
and then Lee Rowland's you know Laurel

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,750
and did a quick proof of concept for us

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,779
and said by the way I have this proof of

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,779
concept we said oh okay yay GPL go

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:18,350
community and so decided you know

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,990
workbench is going to be the i'm going

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,730
to say low end module it's going to be

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,089
the simple straightforward version not

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,420
the kitchen sink approach and we'll just

00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,889
do that and see where it lands and that

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,149
was a gamble to an extent to say all

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,350
right we're just going to do we're not

00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,690
going to cover all of these cases we

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,519
know we can think of but it meant that

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,970
we can actually build it and build it

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,399
well within the time frame and budget we

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,170
were looking at building it and as it

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:50,329
turned out working with dickens him on

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,940
workspace and multi version that other

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,440
fifteen percent is being handled by that

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,329
combination and in fact we're able to

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,449
integrate workbench moderation into

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:02,180
those modules as well so that that

00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:05,329
high-end use case can get taken care of

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,410
by the combination of modules and I

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,240
think that really helped to just have

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,620
that coordination of saying by the way

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,440
we're going to want to do this thing in

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,740
six weeks keep that in mind as you're

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:19,550
building this standalone technically

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,920
smaller version system so yeah making

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,050
that scope call was it you know it was a

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,490
risk but it worked out because we had

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,190
that coordination with others working in

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:33,199
the same space that's great thanks Larry

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:36,350
dick so just to touch on what Larry said

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,390
that so we had our own initiative

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,360
already going when we came into the

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,860
program um so for us the opportunity was

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,410
really just what letter is that there

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,510
the opportunity to collaborate together

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,920
with other people in

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:52,060
community because that how strange it

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,540
might sound that doesn't necessarily

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,000
happen naturally I see ich ich use and

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,370
so on doesn't necessarily give people

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,050
the opportunity to get on a call have

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,950
someone to organize is that pulling

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,480
people together so that was super useful

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,100
and something that might not have

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,180
happened if we just had our own

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,490
initiative go so that was really to

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,810
Hanson first question there that was

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,880
what got me really excited except that

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:24,700
collaboration opportunity and for the

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,520
for this sec for the last question did

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,670
collaboration within the idiot map in

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:35,800
accelerate you at first no he slowed us

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:40,720
down haha great what is very very right

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,730
reasons and we had we were just pushing

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,640
the button almost to publish beta

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,620
versions of our modules I think in

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,590
november or something like that I can

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,270
November that just got ripped up all of

00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,670
that got ripped up but again for the

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:57,280
very right reasons so we sort of the dog

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,290
into a period after your touching base

00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,180
with everyone else saying okay we need

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,010
to reorder texture a few things here to

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,170
make this work better across the

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,560
spectrum of modules that we working on

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:10,690
and I'm super happy with the outcome it

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,820
did delay us it did sort of set up some

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,720
internal goals that we initially had but

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,220
again for the very right reasons so it

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,040
didn't necessarily like sin right but

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,130
the outcome is way better and I think

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,400
much better for the future yeah did you

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:29,650
want to talk about where multi version

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,090
might be going and its its potential

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,770
inclusion into core because there were

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,340
some really powerful out comes out of

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:40,420
that slowing down process so during this

00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:43,210
whole process getting out more in the

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,990
community talking to a contributor pers

00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:49,090
talking to more core committees etc it's

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,710
been a lot of excitement around the

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,740
combined functionality

00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,180
many modules so there's a there's a

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,180
suite of modules that we talking about

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,100
here a workbench moderation multi

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,580
version and there's a module called

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:09,070
workspace and and the deployment model

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:11,260
itself and that sort of combined suite

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:13,240
of modules has turned into an official

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,209
core initiative that reason ounce during

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,420
the keynote today of which I'm

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:24,310
supposedly the the initiative

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:26,260
coordinator yeah so so that's super

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:30,760
exciting which means that there is

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:33,310
commitment in the with the cork meters

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,600
and the in the general community as well

00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:39,130
to make this happen right so lots of

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,050
details here it seems to be figured out

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,930
of course and and so but that's that

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,550
super excited excellent and that was

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,960
very much an outcome of the

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:52,420
collaboration that happen over the past

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,890
of them oh great so Ted I know Oh Ted I

00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,920
know you have story to share even though

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,020
you're shy sir that's worked on a few

00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,430
modules I think one sort of interesting

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,540
related to the question was scheduled

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:06,310
updates and probably one of the ways i

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,580
would have developed differently because

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,310
of the program was you know initially it

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,400
was for scheduling workbench moderation

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,710
updates but with a lot of the changes in

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,410
da everything moving to fields and stuff

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,180
like that is that you know we're able to

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,130
make a module that you know just

00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,710
basically schedules the updates of

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,290
fields and i think i don't think i would

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,540
have probably made it as generalized if

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,300
i wasn't working on a larger team and

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:39,510
getting more feedback and sort of with

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,510
if i was making it just for myself for

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,730
contributor a client who had you know a

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,190
specific really small need to schedule

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,930
something i probably wouldn't have made

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,390
the time to make it a more generalized

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,970
module to say you know schedule all the

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,300
things so i think I hopefully it will be

00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:01,450
useful you know in other aspects of just

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,790
just workbench moderation as far as

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,419
collaboration with other team members I

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,980
think it

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,169
really helped because you're not working

00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,799
to trip a lot and you know you do get

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:13,960
feedback from people when you post

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,720
issues or something or they post issues

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,600
but usually not an especially timely

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,629
manner so you might just have to make a

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,279
decision you know post some feedback or

00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,659
post an issue to get feedback but you

00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,080
don't get feedback so you just kind of

00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:30,909
make the decision on your own so to be

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,369
able to have that daily call where you

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:35,739
know hey I was thinking about doing this

00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:37,570
with the module where somebody might

00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:41,440
look at something or they just might you

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:43,539
know just the 10 or 15 minutes to put an

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,129
ID out there and people say oh no don't

00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:47,169
do it that way do it some other way or

00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:50,859
yeah that's a that's a good way to do it

00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:53,739
I think made the work across the

00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:55,869
different modules that I made better and

00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:59,320
probably accelerated stuff because I

00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:01,659
probably didn't go down as many dead in

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,309
paths that I might have if I didn't get

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,769
the feedback and just like I'll just try

00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,999
this play and I'll try that way and

00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:09,580
eventually find the way that I think

00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:13,529
works but I probably would have hit a

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,629
lot of more dead ends in that process

00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:20,739
and I think also because it wasn't such

00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:22,659
early stages of d8 that all of that

00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:24,340
collaboration was more useful than it

00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:27,309
maybe it would have been if it was if da

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,820
had been how for you know two years is

00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:33,609
because there you know it's hard to know

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,889
all the different problems or changes in

00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:37,989
d 8 so having people who work on core

00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:41,200
work on contribs to sort of asked

00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:43,080
questions right away I think the yeah

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,859
the benefit of being part of that team

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,269
was a was a lot more was a lot more

00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:51,519
important because of the time and it

00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:53,559
happened not that it wouldn't be

00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,809
important in two years but it's it was

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,609
even more important that it happened you

00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:02,799
know starting in november as far as

00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:04,960
getting a trip larry just to piggyback

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,200
on that one of the I think really nice

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,720
outcomes of this process is drew blaze

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,299
still knew a lot of the you know

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,470
recommended patterns are different in a

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,820
thin and seven the way you would go

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,119
about tackling the problem is different

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:22,389
and having a number of different people

00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,159
at a number of different places in the

00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:26,379
process of ramping up to drupal aides

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,629
who can all collaborate on figuring out

00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:31,179
okay which of these seven ways is

00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:33,820
probably the best way given Drupal 8 for

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,830
a problem was i thinkin valuable just

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,299
saying oh I'm coming from Drupal 7 I

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,559
would never have thought to take that

00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,960
approach to solve this kind of problem

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:45,369
but that totally works because Drupal 8

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,779
and you know that kind of taking you

00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,759
know being able to take the time and

00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,919
establish those breasts practice for

00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:54,039
Drupal 8 means that the modules we were

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,529
working on you know I had the eyes of a

00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,929
half-dozen senior level people looking

00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:00,909
at the architecture together and saying

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,529
all right this this approach will work

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:05,109
this approach won't work because Drupal

00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,629
8 this approach you know totally works

00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:09,759
now because Drupal 8 and lets us

00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:11,230
collectively figure out what those are

00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,599
rather than all coming to slightly

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,190
different conclusions over the course of

00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,349
next six months and then nothing being

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,669
consistent so a lot of things that I

00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:21,970
even I wouldn't have thought of doing

00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,559
working with the other people on on the

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:27,330
map team and other people from palantir

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,799
who are working on it we're able to say

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,619
what what's the nice d8 way of doing

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,389
this okay let's all do the same way yeah

00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:37,299
and I think one of the concepts that

00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:40,330
that was really strong in terms of

00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:41,950
changing architectures was the idea of

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,710
the plug-in system and we found this

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,129
with the workspace preview system that

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,059
we're looking at integrating into

00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:50,590
lightning your lightning might have a

00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,940
slightly different use case to other

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,639
people who are using the modules set

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,159
that that did containment building out

00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,809
and when we're thinking about systems of

00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,149
resolving conflicts of content it's

00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,190
really specific but because we have a

00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:05,980
way to build a generalized module and

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:09,720
then and then integrate and then build

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:12,100
out certain methods to decide you know

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,380
how this particular project

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,049
needs to approach that problem it gave

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:20,500
us a much more generalized architecture

00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:24,850
David you worked with us on panels and

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:27,429
David also still building monopoly and

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,440
are involved and one of the core

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:31,630
maintainer zip Napoli we are still

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,820
pushing forward relatively slowly on

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,500
panoply free-to-play intra-company the

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,270
Sprint's on friday we're definitely

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,220
going to be working more on monopoly for

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:44,409
Drupal 8 and of panels inconsistent

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:46,299
modules so the effort to bring panels or

00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:48,370
some sort of block and layout system to

00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:51,520
Drupal 8 had been going on for a really

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:54,220
long time I've been involved in it for

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,590
like the past two and a half years so

00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,270
when the monitor vil acceleration

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,760
program came around like we already had

00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,789
an existing team that was already you

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,860
know executing a road map but relatively

00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:09,280
slowly since we're all doing it in our

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,280
contribute I'm my contribution up until

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,659
that point was primarily organizational

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,429
you know getting everyone together and

00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:16,390
you know figuring out where we are and

00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:18,190
how we're going to move forward and

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:22,929
making sure that anyone talk to each

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:24,490
other this program was awesome because I

00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,490
could finally like sit down and write

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,750
some real code just really cool

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:32,380
otherwise you know it's trying to find

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,030
client work to fit it in and you know as

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,070
if you're doing it just in your sort of

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,049
community open-source time I mean I got

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,850
to write code it's prints but now this

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:42,130
is really cool um you know we've been

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,830
doing it for two years until the

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,870
acceleration program you know we still

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:51,159
have a lot of work to do to get the

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,659
panel's ecosystem fully feature complete

00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,240
and in Drupal 8 but we made more

00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:59,320
progress than we have it any other time

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,640
during this program so yeah it was just

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,169
super exciting to say you know this

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,880
thing that you're doing and your free

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,190
time that you love and that you care

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,080
about like hey you can get paid to do

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:11,740
that instead of client work for three

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,010
months or four months so yeah it I think

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,480
this was a fantastic a great um Adam I

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:21,010
would like you to talk a little bit

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,360
about our decision around web form and

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,220
then I'd love it if other people would

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,389
chime in because this is we had to make

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,579
some tough decisions in

00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:28,929
terms of what to accelerate what would

00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:31,690
have the most impact you know we thought

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:34,029
about a grid of we thought about a grid

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,369
of high-impact high difficulty low

00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:37,989
impact low difficulty and what we could

00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,359
execute and what would make the most

00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:43,959
difference with the resource available

00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:45,459
so yeah we were actually moving forward

00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,219
with the port of web form at one point

00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:50,019
Nick Ted had already taken that on a

00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:51,879
little bit further and then what would

00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:54,009
happen I think it was a result of the

00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:55,239
everybody that time this panel plus was

00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:56,349
quite a few more you know really

00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:58,179
thinking it through a little bit more

00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:01,209
and looking at what we consider our

00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:03,639
eighty percent use case scenario and

00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:06,249
what we could achieve with contacting

00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:09,429
core and contact storage and maybe just

00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:10,719
a few hours towards polishing those up a

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:12,009
little bit and what we ended up

00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:14,679
realizing was that our eighty percent

00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:16,239
use case was essentially met already so

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,879
that was I don't know how many hundreds

00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:20,919
of developer hours saved in some regards

00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:22,959
we were able to polish up contact to

00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,519
context towards a little bit meet a

00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:27,279
couple of use cases that work met with

00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,599
those with some resources and now we're

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,459
waiting on somebody to really neat web

00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,279
formed actually tort web form which i'm

00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:35,200
not sure what if that'll happen but that

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,219
was another 1i think that you like a li

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,239
roland you brought it before it is

00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,499
identified you know there are some

00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:41,979
things that contact accounting storage

00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:44,679
don't you but i don't think that those

00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:46,719
are eighty percent of use cases so yeah

00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,459
that was a tough decision and you know

00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:49,450
we like we said we're moving forward

00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:51,809
with it i think that we made the right

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,129
decision by catching it yeah and if we

00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:56,019
when we have the questions at the end

00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:57,909
you know i'd love for the audience to

00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:00,309
put forward their modules that they're

00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:01,659
interested in and we can talk about you

00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:03,369
know whether they're in process or

00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:05,379
whether where they are in the priority

00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:08,229
list and you know and how we can

00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:09,820
prioritize them is anyone else have

00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:11,829
anything to say about web form with that

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,190
particular kind of dilemma around

00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:14,190
modules

00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:19,240
another kind of generalizing that a bit

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,880
in many cases there's a module that

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,480
existed in Drupal 7 that doesn't need to

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,670
exist in Drupal 8 or you know the eighty

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,860
percent of the module that you would

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,380
have used it for cork and now handle on

00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,500
its own like contacting one example and

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:37,690
then is it a better use of time to just

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,520
make contact and core that extra twenty

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,970
percent better and then webform doesn't

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,510
exist contact module is just everything

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:48,370
maybe you know there is talk of that but

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,910
don't look for a particular module name

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:53,320
that is is or isn't the d8 yet look for

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,940
functionality capability that is or

00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,290
isn't ready for dat yet because it may

00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,090
be coming from a different angle and be

00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,640
way better and already works it's just

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,549
under a different name so be open to

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,679
that yeah and you know one question I've

00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:08,140
got for the panel is because we we often

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,210
have clients approach us with a list of

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,820
user stories of functionality what do

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,460
you think the best ways to find out what

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,700
what modules are out there that

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,200
potentially fulfill that functionality

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,929
knowing that they use something in d7

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,540
now they're going to have to look in da

00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:32,200
what would be your your way of finding

00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:33,580
out how to get something done in da look

00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,809
the reason Larry wants me to answer this

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,960
is because I still write all of our

00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:41,080
project estimates okay so the answer is

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,580
basically keep your ear to the ground in

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,620
the contribs base but you also have to

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,910
know what core is capable so yeah it's

00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,490
true I was actually trying to convince

00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,840
web chick this morning that she didn't

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,650
need web floor

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,990
she's like you know what's gonna be the

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,690
great thing of Drupal 8 2 and I'm like

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:59,840
what contact storage in core and say you

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,730
don't need web for me she's like we

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,110
can't do that and why kiss you can it's

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:08,330
a marketing problem not a technical

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:10,670
problem we can solve so so yeah you you

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,050
need to know what core is capable of now

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:15,920
there's some great stuff I remember

00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:17,960
seeing michael schmidt from whose he

00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,790
wouldn't be from amazing labs doing a

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,620
talk about well here's what you can do

00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,240
with blocks in Drupal 8 which means I

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,520
don't need these eight modules anymore

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,560
right that was a great presentation from

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,690
from Amsterdam last year so knowing

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,390
what's going on in core is important and

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,400
then you know we're at a state now we're

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,040
just sort of watching new module

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,360
releases as they come out some i was

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,700
working some of the aqua folks on a

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,740
gigantic rfp last week and there were

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,740
like three modules released last last

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,660
week that tactic requirements off for

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,340
that project and it's like well great

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,640
now i have to write that so I mean

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,500
that's really what you have to do but

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,000
from a non technical standpoint like I

00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
said I was for the product owner here

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,080
basically telling Larry don't know

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,640
that's not even scope don't do that but

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:07,070
I'm the one who was advocating for the

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:10,180
75% used case right of just giving the

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,100
development team requirements and

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,360
actually use cases an actual personas of

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,890
a dick and I had an argument this

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,240
morning where he's like oh this is

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,460
really important I was like no dick

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,970
that's a ten percent use k because

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,140
Pfizer is special advisor is huge and

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,820
you know ninety percent of people who

00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:31,460
use Drupal don't need that feature so

00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,700
and that's my eyes have arguments got it

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,680
okay i'm not saying to have heart I'm

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,770
saying I'm actually saying to present

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,630
some evidence yeah it says this is the

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:44,680
expressed need here's who is expressing

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,720
it and this is why that's important

00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,450
great thanks Ken Tim I'm not going to

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,160
let you escape this process I'm sure out

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,160
innovation has an approach for this so

00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:01,340
I don't know if there's more I can say

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:04,070
than what Watkins already said it's just

00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,710
a case of its executive in your ear to

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,790
the ground and seeing what what sort of

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:14,180
coming out and the best way I find is

00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:16,730
social media and everybody's tweeting

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:20,030
about what they're up to there are

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:23,870
Twitter accounts about core changes and

00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:25,640
about contrib changes just keep an eye

00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,250
on them and see what's being released

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,310
and see what's was getting getting out

00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:35,330
there and yeah there's so much good

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:39,080
stuff going on yeah Adam I know that

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:42,770
there was a channel on IRC d eight ports

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,810
as well IRC I was going to say that at

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:48,170
the very beginning not everybody uses

00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:51,650
IRC but social media covers that we do

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:53,090
have a channel drupal 8 dash ports where

00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:56,900
most of the members of this team tend to

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,610
hang out and hash out things so that's a

00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,740
great space and people they're generally

00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,820
pretty friendly and willing to answer

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,010
questions that you might have about

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,870
specific modules to so Drupal 8

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,710
dashboards yeah maybe we could kickstart

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:11,180
the hashtag the follow-up something

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,740
seemed to sort of jog my memory this is

00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,240
again not a unique problems with Drupal

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,800
8 judy's mentioned his keynote right

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,870
it's like I've seen this cycle over and

00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,430
over again the first time I ran into

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:23,570
this was actually in Drupal four not

00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:27,170
five when node q came out the day I

00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,790
decided I needed literally I was about

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,370
to write it I was like I better see if

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,710
anyone's done this book and released

00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,930
like an hour later it was great so yeah

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,440
again this is not a unique problem space

00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:41,780
and the community knows how to handle I

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,230
do really like this kind of project very

00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:47,900
I got more to say about that but Larry

00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:50,540
one other note on that if about working

00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,160
with Drupal 8 you come across hey I

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,290
would have done this thing this hard way

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,340
Drupal 7 and now there's this easy way

00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,100
in Drupal 8 that it wouldn't have

00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,690
thought of please write a blog get it on

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,250
drupal planet so that everyone else in

00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,260
the room can read the blog and use the

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,630
easy way to so if you're not calling

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,179
through planet follow it and if you find

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,999
a way that is 0 contact module solve

00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:13,399
web form anymore or whatever else you

00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:15,110
run into tell people about it so that

00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:24,200
they can benefit from a two because

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:26,450
everyone can give ya so just three

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,919
concrete tips that I sometimes use for

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,879
searching for new functionality and so

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:36,619
on and one I search Drupal palette and

00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:39,710
then too I go to drupal.org / list dash

00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:43,610
changes which is a summary of all this

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:47,659
change notes in in Drupal both draft

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:50,539
change notes and publish one's super

00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:53,629
good summary high level summary in sort

00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:55,970
of natural language the summarizes new

00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:58,970
functionality and then I also go to

00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,610
Drupal associations youtube channel and

00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:04,100
just search for module name and there's

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,230
there is going to be a presentation

00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,970
about your module there either how it

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,740
works in Drupal 8 why you don't need it

00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,929
because the side of things replaces it

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:16,040
so those three things Drupal planet

00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:18,500
drupal a dogs / list changes that

00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,500
Sheamus and then the associations own

00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,179
YouTube channel great tips I like to add

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,339
to that on that gem has also been

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,559
running a module of the week program

00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:30,049
where he highlights modules that are

00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:33,260
ready to go and so that's that's a great

00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:36,859
place to to look for modules as well you

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:40,549
know his blog so you know I think this

00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:43,280
there's a question in here for Ken which

00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:45,589
is what effect do you think the program

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,379
may have had on palantir you know

00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:51,409
building out workbench and building out

00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:53,510
that that ecosystem how do you how do

00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:57,650
you think that effects the your business

00:34:53,510 --> 00:35:00,290
I mean it's really good for our business

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,819
I'll say this goes to what I was just

00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:07,520
thinking I mean there are three basic

00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:10,280
models for module development right one

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,799
is solo developer has a great idea wants

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,960
to get it out of her head she writes it

00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:18,440
she released that's a great model I've

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,089
done that before too is someone comes to

00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,069
you with a requirement and pays you to

00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:23,420
do that

00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:25,039
that can get you some really interesting

00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,589
challenges the example how to have

00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,809
actually for Dave because panels for

00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:32,150
Drupal 7 we had one of the panels

00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:33,799
contributors on staff at the time so we

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,910
have a client site still using like

00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:40,490
panel 7 dot 1 alpha 2 which then got

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,890
trashed and forked and never used again

00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:46,490
and so it's a dead end code branch and

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:48,650
that cited just stuck so those are both

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,940
siloed approaches and then you have

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,530
something like module acceleration

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,849
program where it's like okay let's take

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,950
a bunch of people and let them

00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,960
collaborate and yes they're working on

00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,760
different things but again they're

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,230
working on the same types of problem so

00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,660
for instance even in the work that I've

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,369
been doing sort of in my side like I

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,500
talked to Larry about data storage which

00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:08,480
is a very different thing in Drupal so

00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,190
that's been really really beneficial and

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,170
I will also say actually did John and

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,720
Adams credit the other thing that map

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:18,140
gave to us as an agency was some dead

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,190
lockers right deadlines this is the

00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,920
other dirty little secret right

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,299
deadlines matter in software development

00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,490
right because without a deadline you're

00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:26,809
not going to finish right because you're

00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,789
not going to make the hard choices you

00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:31,160
have to make in order to declare

00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:33,170
something so that's what I think we've

00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,740
been able to do and what that's going to

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,210
do is again generating a lot of

00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,289
excitement we're doing a workbench I'll

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,170
give an example doing a workbench

00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,510
webinar right the last webinar I did had

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,980
three attendings the workbench webinar

00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,289
got two dozen attendees within two hours

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:57,410
of its announcement don't be on the

00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:59,089
twenty-fourth pilot now that's great is

00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,490
there anyone wants to add anything i'm

00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:02,630
going to skip on probably you know for a

00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,710
couple of minutes describe lining and

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:08,869
then gets the questions there any

00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:10,369
anything else from the panel cool all

00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:12,799
right I want to talk to you just for a

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:15,319
minute about lightning we couldn't have

00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:17,720
done lightening without map so many of

00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:20,839
the modules that we built in map are now

00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,029
enlightening and it's you know another

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,220
way that are queer is giving back to

00:37:23,029 --> 00:37:27,529
Drupal you know this is a completely

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,529
open source distribution it's failed all

00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:32,660
on drupal.org and through composer and

00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:34,160
it's for enterprise authoring so that

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,020
means that it rats wraps

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,480
certain functionality and for our quia

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,579
you know we by default when we build on

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,559
Drupal 8 we build with lightning now

00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:44,030
that's not going to be for everyone but

00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,069
the type of client we have where they

00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,920
need to have sophisticated authoring

00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:51,680
functionality that makes sense for us

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,250
and really what what lightning does is

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,750
it serves the developer it accelerates

00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,849
the development experience it gives you

00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,609
that twenty percent of the beginning to

00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:04,760
get going it gives you standards and and

00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:06,260
module configurations so the developer

00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,700
can serve the site builder and the

00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,789
content author and the site designer

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,980
giving them the tools they need to build

00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:15,049
out great experiences so lighting is a

00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,170
foundation or a starter kit it tightly

00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:19,849
couples over 20 modules and configures

00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,829
them to lightweight frame work with

00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:24,380
documentation and best practice examples

00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:26,690
for Drupal and it's really made up of

00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,950
four functional areas layout workflow

00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:32,210
preview and media and and three

00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:35,180
development principles security

00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,650
integrations and testing so layout you

00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,760
know really wraps up a lot of work that

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:42,579
that David did for us in the panel's

00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,289
ecosystem and gives you things like

00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:46,760
drag-and-drop layouts changing how many

00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:51,140
columns you have on a page being able to

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:53,210
create landing pages and workflow you

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,579
know brings arbitrary workflow States

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,069
it's really workbench moderation and

00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:59,720
configuration that we've brought to be

00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:02,240
able to allow you to put content through

00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,770
a workflow you know in preview we're

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,109
going to be bringing from our workspace

00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,900
preview system which you know is what a

00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:12,230
dick and Tim have built out you know and

00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:14,150
and will be enlightening 1.1 and media

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,609
you know we've got so many people to

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,799
thank for for meteor integrations

00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:20,930
there's too many for right now but the

00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:25,130
ability to bring in social media into

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:26,809
your web experience so lightning wraps

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,339
all this up with some automated testing

00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:29,990
it's really useful for developers so

00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:31,670
we've got b-hat tests so if you're

00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,900
building on top of lightning you can

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,400
actually test whether you've broken any

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,020
of those modules their functionalities

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,240
and that should mean you can go really

00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,849
fast and set up continuous integration

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,140
and continuous deployment lightning

00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,930
scope great adoption we've had a bunch

00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,910
of people in our beta program from large

00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,920
agencies like me remand vml and phase

00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,930
two

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,720
princeton edu is going to launch on

00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,540
lightning in the fall and what a music

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,549
is using it for their next big platform

00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,960
you know and there's lots of lots of

00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:02,040
people coming on to lightning as I said

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,510
are queer now users lightning by default

00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,650
for every build they do on da so

00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,630
lightnings available available on dev

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,480
desktop as i said before drupal.org

00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:18,609
through composer and there's a lightning

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:20,799
aquaduct com site for developers so they

00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:22,510
know how to install it and how to

00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:24,790
upgrade it which by the way it can be a

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,500
one line upgrade will provide an upgrade

00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,359
path between all versions of lightning

00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,240
and you basically get functionality for

00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:34,450
free as we build more into lighting so

00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:37,930
before so i want to now go into a quick

00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,819
Q&A session for the panel so if you want

00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,430
to step up i'm not sure if we have a

00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:44,880
second microphone what I'm going to do

00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,680
though is I'm just going to see if I can

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,540
I'm going to go okay so if you step up

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,549
and ask a question I'll repeat your

00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,740
question and in the panel can answer so

00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:56,549
if everyone if anyone was come up right

00:40:53,740 --> 00:41:07,150
now in formal line at the at the pole

00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:09,930
the michaelis pole if you talk I'll be

00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,930
able to hear you yeah

00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,190
so I might let you repeat that one Larry

00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,530
just so we've got the question on a

00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,810
record and then you can answer it the

00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:34,740
question was there's also a module

00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:36,060
called workflow so what made us decide

00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,940
to go with workbench moderation of a

00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:42,240
workflow we actually looked at the

00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:45,000
workflow module and you know considered

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,940
using that as a basis what we decided

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,040
was a lot of the functionality was

00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,230
similar between that and work went to

00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,560
moderation but it had enough other

00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:58,560
things tightly coupled on top of it that

00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:02,100
we would have had to rip off in a sense

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,320
and that also add another dependency

00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,960
that we didn't want to bring in so it

00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,350
end up being less work to just have our

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,790
own states and transitions and then lay

00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,740
our own functionality on the top of that

00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,180
rather than trying to fight what another

00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:19,230
assumptions and other modules already

00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:20,880
making I would love to see just the

00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:24,840
states and transitions concept become

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,340
its own thing spoiler we that's

00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,770
something we've been talking about may

00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,740
end up in core at some point as just a

00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,120
thing on its own and then if you want to

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,650
extend that country than you have a more

00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,990
common baseline for it that was

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,180
basically of thinking there was you know

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:42,240
fewer dependencies to have to work

00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:46,050
around and just let's just get this

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,390
thing working nicely we actually brought

00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,800
the developer into a couple meetings too

00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,390
i think it's worth noting we did some

00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,190
collaboration and i think we kind of

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,840
mutually decided that these were two

00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:58,340
independent projects just for the record

00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,340
yeah great thanks

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,410
Adam you want to rhea reiterate the

00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,740
questions so we've got it on the mic

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:25,579
yeah so the question was drupal commerce

00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,799
to using external libraries and have we

00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:29,329
found any and he uses to external

00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:31,369
libraries and stuff that we're doing and

00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:33,500
it's not so much have you found uses for

00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:35,930
those more light in their case with

00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:39,740
currents thing that they were able to

00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:41,690
say this is a use case we have the tons

00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,579
of other people did you find any

00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:47,000
opportunities to take things like oh we

00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,769
saw this problem let's but it doesn't

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,900
have to be as time to couple to Drupal

00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:54,890
as it's been so contribute back to PHP

00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:59,329
my exact right so the one thing we've

00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:03,650
been doing with our deployments so multi

00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:06,349
version workspace and deploy is we allow

00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,329
cross site content staging so you can

00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:10,490
have a staging site in a production site

00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:14,509
and move your content between them for

00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:17,779
this we using counter TVs API and we've

00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:19,849
got a couple of external libraries that

00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:24,049
we're using for that one of them is a

00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:26,869
PHP replicator which uses the same

00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:31,910
protocol as couch TV to replicate

00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:34,759
content but it's all written in PHP this

00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,619
uses then can t be client which is a

00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:40,039
doctrine project so we've also been

00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:42,410
contributing back to that as well so we

00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:46,839
include this into the relaxed module

00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:49,579
fire composer as external PHP libraries

00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:51,980
the replicator was actually done as a

00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:55,970
google summer of code project last year

00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:58,339
so dick meant order student last year

00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:59,530
for google Summer of Code and we're

00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:02,890
planning to do the same

00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:05,470
again this year we've got another google

00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:09,490
Summer of Code project and we're looking

00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:11,440
at building out a conflict management

00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,990
system so when you're replicating

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,260
content between sites or between

00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:20,080
workspaces on the same site will both be

00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:24,300
able to flag up and resolve conflicts

00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:30,880
with an external PHP library that can

00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:32,410
resolve these conflicts great is there

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,500
any on the room hat oh yeah got another

00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,500
question

00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:56,699
so the question was what's missing from

00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:59,219
contacting context storage so i made

00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:01,859
entity forum for drupal 7 so i think i

00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,989
made sort of like the alternative that

00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:06,539
does the eighty percent but i think the

00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:08,759
thing that web form does really well

00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:14,729
there's a couple things one having tons

00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:18,599
of forms in to having some forms that

00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:20,699
have just tons and tons of fields so the

00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,160
fact that contact or in the former you

00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:24,779
form would use the field system is going

00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:29,339
to bring some complications if you have

00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:34,619
like a five hundred thousand field form

00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:37,640
which apparently happens you can because

00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:42,589
there are some like there's a big issue

00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:46,589
on troop on web form about porting to

00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:48,299
drupal 8 is a really long discussion

00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:50,939
about like the benefits and should we

00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:54,390
just make it all bundles and fields and

00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:56,669
you know the you know I sort of put my

00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,559
two cents in there and I think general

00:46:56,669 --> 00:47:01,319
consensus was you know it would kind of

00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,999
be too you'd lose some of the

00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,589
functionality if you did that so I would

00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:08,519
think anytime you're thinking of like

00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:10,529
forms as content on your site I feel

00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,650
like conte the contact form solution

00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:15,390
maybe falls down a little bit because

00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,609
you know contact forms are config inity

00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,679
your fields or configure nities so if

00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:22,619
you really want to hand off making forms

00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:26,839
to your clients right now I don't not

00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:29,339
sure that contact and contact storage is

00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:30,630
the way to go and I was sort of one of

00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:33,150
the people that talked them out of

00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:34,739
porting web form basically they hired me

00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,509
in web form was the first project and I

00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:37,979
said oh you don't need it and please

00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:44,069
hopefully give me something else to work

00:47:37,979 --> 00:47:45,869
on so yeah I mean I think but it's hard

00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:49,019
to say like what percentage that use

00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:51,239
cases but I think a lot of people use by

00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:54,329
forming Drupal 7 for stuff that wasn't

00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:56,819
necessarily where web form was great for

00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:58,979
so if I my feeling is if you have if

00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:01,410
your forms are going to be made by site

00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:03,570
builders

00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:06,090
then maybe webform is not the way to go

00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,920
but if your forms are made by your

00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:11,250
clients on an ongoing basis without

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,230
necessarily contact with you or you know

00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:16,290
a drupal developer it seems like that's

00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,300
where webform really shines yeah so the

00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,940
short answer that question was if you

00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:24,350
really wanted webform in map project

00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,350
blamed Ted

00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:46,429
I should i repeated Ted oh yeah he was

00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:50,599
reading some of the contact comments on

00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:53,119
Jesus last post about I don't forget

00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:54,709
what it was about about the better

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,509
interface they potentially had through

00:48:54,709 --> 00:48:57,890
web form that might actually be with

00:48:56,509 --> 00:49:00,319
form builder that you're talking about

00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:02,779
which is an extension to web for I know

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,630
but the I think there's a gotcha to that

00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:07,729
is web form when you make fields as not

00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:10,489
making tables in your database anything

00:49:07,729 --> 00:49:12,589
else you do is making fields in your

00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:15,589
database so I think the idea that you

00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:17,269
pass off you could clean up the field

00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:19,819
you I and make it sort of simple and

00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:23,059
there was like a attempt at that indie 7

00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:24,949
but if you're clean it up and make it

00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:26,779
easy and pass it off to your clients

00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:29,689
you're not cleaning up the fact that

00:49:26,779 --> 00:49:31,999
underneath there making tables in your

00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:33,289
database and their scale I think they're

00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:35,509
scaling issues I'm probably not the best

00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,739
person to speak on that but you're doing

00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:38,179
something even if you change the

00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:41,269
interface you're doing something

00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:43,339
fundamentally different with any other

00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:45,859
basically any other form system and

00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:48,439
Drupal besides web form a web form like

00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:49,849
it's not producing new tables every you

00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:54,459
know all the submissions go in the same

00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:57,289
place where is contact storage and

00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:58,819
deform and in due form and drupal 7 like

00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:02,689
every time you make a new field you're

00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:04,249
making two new tables and right yeah so

00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:07,929
it's a whole different sort of storage

00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:10,640
and I think just cleaning up the field

00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:12,140
just cleaning up the field you I are

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,699
making a form builder on top of the

00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,309
field you I to make it easier for

00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:17,569
clients as not really I'll feel like

00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:20,329
almost you're opening up a can of worms

00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:21,650
it oh you know I made the field you I a

00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:24,679
whole lot easier now I'm gonna pass it

00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:26,119
off my clients and I don't think you're

00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:27,739
passing off something to your clients

00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:32,150
that they don't Larry vigorously shakes

00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:33,799
his head implications of okay we've only

00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,660
got a couple of minutes left so are

00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:37,219
there any other modules that you're

00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,689
interested in specifically from the

00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:40,309
audience anyone want to raise any

00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:42,559
particular modules that you think should

00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:44,749
be prioritized you think we should be

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:51,819
thinking about going forward apart from

00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:51,819
webform anyone in the audience yes

00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:57,700
organic groups it is not currently in

00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:59,890
the program we suffered a similar Ted

00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:05,650
you want to tell them why we're not

00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:07,690
including it no I know have you looked

00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,520
at the group's module it seems like a

00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,920
lot of people like the group's module I

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,560
mean I love again organic groups it's

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,380
crazy flexible but it's also hard to

00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,160
configure and I'm not sure that

00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,330
everybody needs the crazy flexibility I

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,860
haven't actually used the group module

00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,540
myself but I've talked a lot of people

00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,940
who really sort of like it and it

00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,620
basically the main differences groups

00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:32,230
are their own type of entity where's

00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:35,650
organic groups you add a group field and

00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:38,140
you can make anything accrue so organic

00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:39,970
groups I think still they're developing

00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,740
it but you know I developing it yes yeah

00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,990
gives you crazy amounts of flexibility

00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,960
but there is something out there now if

00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:49,060
you needed something group like but you

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,760
know if you look at the group's module

00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,890
and say hey this does what we you know

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,680
need and it seems like I you know

00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:58,210
there's a podcast on modules unravel the

00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,920
developer talks about it so it seems

00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,470
like it was built in a pretty same way

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,690
so and it's you know it's feel dab'll

00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,980
you know and I think Reid memberships

00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,530
are feel double and stuff like that so

00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,930
you do get some of the flexibility of

00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,000
group of organic groups is just not the

00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:15,160
flexibility to say hey I want this user

00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,320
to be a group Great War a term to be a

00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:29,550
group thanks Ted got a question out the

00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:31,150
back you dribble console okay okay

00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,190
interesting I don't think we've got any

00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:37,420
comments on that we haven't thought

00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:42,370
about drivel console yet being a

00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:45,040
command-line tool rather than a talking

00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:46,750
stick Adam it's been brought up before

00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,910
and I know you've reached out to me

00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,350
directly and we're definitely interested

00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:52,020
in that it's not something that's

00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:55,390
something we need to discuss let's talk

00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,180
let's talk it was a bit the strict

00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,980
definition of

00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,530
what we've previously put in the model

00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,880
Villarreal Graham but I personally think

00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,309
it's very worthy and I'd be interested

00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,359
to find exactly what we're looking what

00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:07,430
it needs to get pushed across the finish

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,050
line so just to wrap up unless you've

00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,390
got anyone with a burning module they

00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,859
want to talk about no okay great so just

00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:15,079
to wrap up Adam you've probably got an

00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:18,079
idea of a couple of the modules we have

00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,640
coming out fairly soon and in our

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,589
roadmap and things that we're focusing

00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,970
on we've just brought on and these

00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:25,040
systems are going to be working with us

00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:26,960
and commerce guys have just signed up to

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,619
work with us so we've got some amazing

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,880
developers you know who are coming on to

00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:35,390
build out some of the media ecosystem

00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,250
and Adam given oh yeah there's so many

00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,690
real meaty modules any more like a lot

00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,770
of the big big ones are we're done by

00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:42,260
the people that are sitting up here but

00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,490
fast 404 is ultimate crime and then a

00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,050
lot of like pushing across the finish

00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,750
line stuff in the media world the drop

00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:50,000
zone module in the media world there's

00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,140
there's over a dozen modules in the

00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,550
media world right now that we're looking

00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,760
to push across but though it was an

00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:57,410
ultimate crime fast 40 fours yeah so we

00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,420
