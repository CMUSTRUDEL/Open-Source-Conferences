Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: D8 Module Acceleration Program
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Last year Acquia commited $500k to porting modules to D8 through the Module Acceleration Program. This will be a panel discussion led by the developers on the challenges and successes of the program. We will also cover the functionality we have been able to bring to D8 with the 40+ modules that have been ported and where you can use them in your projects including:

Panels, Panelizer, Chaos Tools, Page Manager
Workbench moderation 
Workspace Preview System
Search API and other search modules
and many more!
 There will be a long question time at the end to give you a chance to ask about architectural decisions that have been made and the future direction of the program.

This should be accessable to all levels, but even advanced developers should get alot out of the deep discusion of D8 development patterns
