Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: The Big Easy: Streamlined Front-end Development
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Pattern Lab and Twig, the perfect duo to streamline your front-end development process.  

Pattern Lab (patternlab.io) is “a custom static site generator that constructs an interface by stitching atoms, molecules, and organisms together to form templates and pages.” The philosophy of Pattern Lab parallels several core tenets of OOP: Don’t Repeat Yourself and Keep It Simple, Stupid.

Twig (twig.sensiolabs.org) is a fast, secure, and flexible templating engine from Sensio Labs, the people who brought us Symfony. 

In our session we will demonstrate how to combine the power of these two technologies to streamline your front-end development workflow for Drupal 8.

The original version of  Pattern Lab uses Mustache templates, but there's been a Twig version for nearly a year. Using the Pattern Lab starterkit for Twig (https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-twig-standard), we can create patterns that map to Drupal’s Twig templates. Atoms are fields, molecules are view modes, organisms are views themselves! Eureka!!

Questions that may be teeming in your brain:

How do I install Pattern Lab?
What sort of pattern directory structure is required to match Drupal’s?
Are there naming conventions that facilitate the process?
How can I affect the Drupal markup (custom classes) to match my pattern markup?
Relax, it’s not voodoo magic. We’ll answer these questions and more.

In our session, we will: 

Show you how to install Pattern Lab
Let Pattern Lab share your theme's CSS
Create some patterns based on a PSD  mockup and theme them
Build out the mockup in Drupal
Add the custom (using BEM/SMACSS of course!) classes we used in creating our patterns via the Drupal UI
Preview our completed site!


The strength in this approach is threefold:

All the markup is belong to us: once again we can write the markup as we want it; no more divitis!
Two birds, one stone: the Pattern Lab version is visually identical to the Drupal version, and therefore can be used for client approval prior to site development
Theme it once and done: minimal or no "negotiating" Pattern Lab's markup with Drupal's
This session will be fast paced and fun, and we guarantee you'll leave with a new sense of what's possible in Drupal 8 front-end development and beyond!

just out of curiosity even though I'm

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,570

welcome to the Big Easy streamlined

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,730
front-end development with pattern lab

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,400
and twig there's a bitly link to the

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:10,850
slides it'll be all on the last slide as

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:14,939
well so not to worry so here we go so

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,759
who dat what day do snore Orleans speak

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,420
so first we'll do some basic

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,210
introductions my name is Adam Duran it's

architect at forum one i am also a

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,540
drupal evangelist and in the meantime I

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,939
like heckling Morton as well as being a

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:56,430
disc jockey actually a really well-known

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:58,649
disc jockey but only in my basement so

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,290
we are both we both work for forum one

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,990
form one is a full-service digital

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,880
agency that crafts solutions for the

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,440
world's most influential organizations

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,569
such as long laundry list of great

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,710
clients one of those being global

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,290
innovation exchange

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,210
i'll be doing a business top tomorrow on

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,330
little innovation exchange it will not

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,920
be about how great we are or all the

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,050
great stuff we do but it actually would

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,640
be about how great a client they are so

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:34,920
make sure you come check that out so the

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,600
pattern lab and twig right as a late

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,430
great Victor Hugo said nothing is

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,940
stronger than an idea whose time has

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:46,110
come so we're going to give here's the

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,630
basic agenda and we'll just take you

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,730
through where how where we are now with

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,270
or where you may have come from with

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,580
pattern lab and twig and Drupal how you

00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:00,420
may have worked up hill to now what we

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,390
call the Big Easy what we see as a huge

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,670
step forward in combining those elements

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,270
we have a great demo for you just to

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,150
proof of concept and then lots of time

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,810
for questions because you I'm assuming

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,240
hoping you have a bunch so the story so

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,750
far we have how do that how many people

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,970
here have worked with pattern lab before

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,820
all right pattern lab with mustache or

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,690
pattern in lab with twig mustache

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,540
mustache twig are a few people all right

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,040
so I think it's most of you who have not

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,300
worked with pattern labs with your Argan

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,190
after seven pound on up pattern lab is a

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,470
custom site custom static site generator

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,480
that conduct constructs I cannot read

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,270
today an interface by stitching atoms

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,730
molecules and organisms together to form

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:54,450
templates and pages it's philosophy

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,150
philosophy parallels several core tenets

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,330
of Hopi which such as dr why don't

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:05,450
repeat yourself and decay is s keep it

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,450
simple stupid tell us what week

00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,200
I should have Morton come up and tell us

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:16,239
about a twig but what he would say is

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,500
twig rocks thank you twig twig

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,320
you can read the slide for yourself but

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:27,890
the thing about twig is it makes Drupal

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:29,390
8 30 percent more awesomer and as I'm

00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,750
sure you all know by now drupal 8

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,280
adopted twig as its templating engine

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,380
and it allows us to more clearly

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,460
separate the presentation and content

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:44,360
layers so what does that mean what how

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:49,910
does this all work together well we're

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,230
about to find out so I am actually just

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,000
gonna read this the original version of

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,710
patent lab uses mustache templates and

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
there's been a twig version for about a

00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:01,790
year and what's now possible is that you

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,620
can have a twig a pattern lab starter

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:09,560
kit with quick templates that mirrors

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,960
drupal swing templates and put that it

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,590
let that sink in for a second you can

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,500
have the same templates so you could

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,290
maybe make the change in one and have it

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,530
already be changed in the other yeah

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,330
seriously what really and so as you can

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,120
imagine and this is what gets me so

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,310
excited as the ramifications of this are

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,320
ginormous we can not only can we take

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,990
full control of the mark-up but we don't

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,940
have to negotiate with developers you

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,560
don't have to ask your developers oh oh

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,030
I need this class in this place or and

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,120
then they do that and it's in the wrong

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,250
place and it's a nightmare i get so

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,040
frustrated how many how many back-end

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,210
developers are in the room sorry you

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,210
need to find a new job

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,169
the front end developer Mike talking by

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,030
the front end developers the paradigm

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,220
shift is about to take place so it's

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,770
already starting to take place the front

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,110
end of hopers actually have a lot more

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:15,580
control well you know I take that back

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:21,120
you can still do site building so the

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:25,840
hard way this is where pattern lab lives

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,750
next to Drupal they kind of interact

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,520
like siblings yeah like in the back seat

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:36,070
of your cart don't touch me this is my

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:38,680
side this is my side like that so these

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,380
are the front-end development blues so

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,580
you know how this works you git clone

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,259
pattern lab into your theme directory

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,300
and you build at your patterns in your

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,740
CSS and then you get to argue back and

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,590
forth with your back-end developers

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,360
sorry guys we do love you about how the

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,250
mark-up is wrong I mean I can't put that

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,449
in display sweet page panel panel stop

00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,240
stop because here's the mark-up I wanted

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,949
I made it in pattern of that first and

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,560
then it ends up in three different

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:09,610
places and flexbox flows up and I have a

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,490
nice Picasso esque page has this ever

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,340
happened to anyone here besides me yeah

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,530
it's a little frustrating I mean we have

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:23,349
to work together but it's frustrating I

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:28,240
get frustrated and so when you need to

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:30,370
bang your head there you go so but as it

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,610
is said everything is hard before it is

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,440
easy so this is the Big Easy the shared

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:41,110
twig templates between pattern lab and

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:45,460
drupal and this is this is it can all

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:47,979
work simply not that you don't ever have

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,840
to talk to developers again there are

00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,210
things to work out machine names class

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,090
names but all that back and forth

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,750
negotiating markup never has to happen

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:01,659
again so let's talk about those easy

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,880
ingredients are first of all we gots a

00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:06,000
pattern lab integrated Drupal 8 theme

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,090
and I want to give mad

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,460
props to Alexei pebbles Peebles Peebles

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,400
pebbles weebles wobble and they don't

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,530
fall down if you take a look at his

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,330
github repo it was a great starting

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,640
point for us to look at and we've had

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,900
some talks earlier among some other

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,940
speakers and so we're actually starting

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,280
to solidify that we're just not being

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,290
crazy going off on this big easy tangent

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,419
actually there's a couple of other shops

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,599
that are starting to realize this as

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,130
well and one of those is how many people

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,520
are here with the familiar with the

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:44,159
gesso theme that we had for Drupal 7 a

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,470
couple so we're hardly hardly working

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,850
heartily heartedly working heartedly

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:53,730
heartily working or working on for

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,380
Drupal 8 the other thing to think about

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,800
is what these easy ingredients is

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,530
packaged dependency managers NPM power

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,340
oh and this one that we really need to

00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,780
get used to using composer why is that

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:12,089
it's still thing called Drupal oh yeah

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,130
yeah how many people here use gold how

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,950
many pitbull here's grunt okay you guys

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,990
some fight outside of it so the politest

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,660
builders in K for running the

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,839
development builds generating pattern

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:30,300
lab compiling sass rebuilding the drupal

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:33,360
cash among other things so as Chaz just

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,510
said we're building on Alexei people's

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,900
work and you should definitely check out

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:42,720
his blog his website there's a blog and

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,520
we'll have links to his github you can

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
see all the work he's done and there's

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:52,320
we're going to cover various aspects of

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:55,190
it a little more as we go on so tell us

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,400
about the architecture as well sure so

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,920
being a tech arc / front end manager /

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,030
Drupal evangelist all these things kind

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,089
of run around your head when you start

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,670
taking a look at Drupal 8 while back and

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,130
two things really stuck out first of all

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,320
was how the front-end development team

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,200
was utilizing pattern lab to be able to

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,870
actually go off and generate check the

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,920
designs and generate all the mark-up all

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,779
the CSS

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,370
all the interactivity before we even had

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,740
to worry about doing the type of site

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:29,070
building hey light bulb went off Wow we

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,079
need a big jump start on this then came

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,680
along the ability to actually take pad

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,449
in lab put it in the theme as well so

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,459
now you actually mirroring these two

00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:40,860
things so that you had pattern lab which

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,440
was using mustache at the time well on

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,899
with Drupal 8 and twig and will tell

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,579
Along Came pattern lab with twig and now

00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,420
we have a perfect marriage between these

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:54,120
two the next thing was a starter kit

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:58,230
that Alexei actually generated which

00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,449
diverging kind of from what we actually

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,459
realized we were supposed to use because

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:03,690
we have our pattern lab actually inside

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,920
our theme and we use the source

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,320
directory which will see here a little

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,570
bit so we started diverging from his

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,490
model which actually had because a

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,199
starter key can drop into anything you

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,240
want you don't have to worry about the

00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:17,190
other structure there with it but with

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,410
the challenge with that with a starter

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,680
kit was it wasn't really kind of

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,209
normalized for from my mindset we want

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,010
its source to be inside the pattern lab

00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,390
source we don't want it to be outside we

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,040
didn't want it to generate some

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,320
additional things nothing wrong with

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,790
that method by the way okay but we

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,589
actually normalized this a bit to bring

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,390
the directory structure back into

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,630
pattern lab where we were used to

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,279
working with it so as you can see from

00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,829
this diagram on the left you have a

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,779
directory structure for the Lexi's

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,899
charla theme on the right our big easy

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:52,709
theme and the biggest difference is that

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:54,480
he has a starter kit which is parallel a

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:56,370
sibling to pattern lab and inside

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,769
there's a dist folder and distance

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,649
basically the pattern lab source folder

00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:05,339
and because we use gesso as our main

00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:08,130
theme at forum one and we use it as a

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:12,720
base theme we just saw this is just an

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:14,940
extra layer of complexity so we moved we

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,819
got rid of the dist we moved it back as

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,829
source into the main pattern lab folder

00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,829
as you can see on the right side

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,680
so that voodoo they do so well there's

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,230
actually two really cool key components

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,760
this I'm kind of flip around flip using

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,070
actually in order of the slides here but

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,590
first is a few patches actually the

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,950
pattern lab and the pattern lamp twig

00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:43,020
version that actually helps kind of

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,340
bring these two more in line by

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,490
utilizing something that's called a

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,570
dated transform plugin so and how many

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,350
people have been doing any type of

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:53,790
theming in Drupal 8 so far ok so so

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,770
you're used to using attributes right

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,260
attributes dad class after he saw dad

00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,730
attribute and so those are generated you

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,590
know in Drupal as well as you can add to

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,620
it as well but what if you could turn

00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:06,810
around inside of twig and actually

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,730
utilize those same attribute twig inside

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,830
of pattern in lab so what if you could

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:18,840
use the in the JSON files for any given

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:22,440
twig template and have your attributes

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:25,680
and inside of that and then get have

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,320
those paths have the jas have the JSON

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,690
excuse me pass those attributes into the

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,880
twig template on the pattern lab side be

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,290
the exact same structure as what PHP is

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,020
passing from Drupal into the twig

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:41,040
templates on the Drupal side if they

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,840
mirror each other the syntax can be

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,840
identical with the data getting passed

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:52,530
in AZ is identical the template can be

00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:55,350
the same mind blown so better than

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,580
Tabasco maybe I'll of tabasco but it's

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,450
actually the secret sauce the data

00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:03,630
transfer employ cool so now we're going

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:13,250
to have a demonstration and show you how

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:18,560
this all works any terminal window users

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:20,640
ok good you're like what the heck is it

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,900
so a couple different different things

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,100
real quick so imagine pattern lab the

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,360
way that you would actually generate it

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,160
k i'm sort of working through a couple

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,270
different things here those things are

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,860
going to be actually going into the

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,180
pattern lab folder itself running

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,230
composer installing or in this case

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,150
since i already have in

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,210
composer update make sure as any

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:41,820
dependencies they need to be pulled down

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,500
then jump up a level run NPM install and

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,520
Bower install as I'm running these I'm

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,620
going to go ahead and talk about a

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,020
couple of things so let's take a look

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:55,820
real quick but we're at let's go

00:14:49,020 --> 00:15:02,000
actually go into pattern lab I sure can

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,000
it's a good can you all read that right

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,880
alright so composer yeah hopefully

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,360
you're already utilizing composer

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,580
finding people used rush okay so

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,770
obviously you had to install composer at

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,240
some point to actually be able to get

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,330
dress working with your Drupal 8

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,250
instances so composer is just a

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,720
dependency manager it's actually going

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,490
and updating some dependencies right now

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,340
for me or actually going and taking out

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,200
look out me a nerd interweb so to speak

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:45,660
and hopefully the conference Wi-Fi will

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:50,790
play nicely this is where Morton said

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:58,580
you should have recorded it I know all

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:58,580
your tricks right now yep hey was like

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:04,410
alright so now going to jump up a level

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:11,010
okay I'm actually going to run NPM

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:15,600
install so I'm mouse cursor is citing me

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,250
go down there alright so NPM install is

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,480
going and grabbing anything that I've

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:23,790
specified in the package.json file yep

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,940
why that's running real quick for those

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,390
that maybe have not seen pattern lab

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,020
before so I'll let you go in tomm sure

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:37,170
so we recently relaunched the forum one

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:41,970
website uh in Drupal 8 and this is the

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:45,510
pattern lab for it and pattern lab in a

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,470
nutshell allows you to more than just

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,600
style guide it allows you to create

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,450
I'm just going to scroll here you can

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:58,120
set all your basic colors fonts all your

00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,560
blockquote everything is already to any

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,140
time someone uses a block quote this is

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,790
how it's going to come out anytime you

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:08,350
eat all your basic you know lists but it

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:13,030
gets way more complicated so you have a

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:16,480
numbered list you have filters tables

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:18,880
you can have a pattern for anything that

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,240
you want we have a version of pattern

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,570
lab for gesso that covers all of the

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,550
basics and then we add images image

00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:29,800
styles that we're going to create image

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,210
tiles for and Drupal so that we can see

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,940
either they're going to look and then we

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,760
can bind them as we go down with here

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:42,490
what is this is the oops article by line

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:45,250
with an image and the person's name and

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,380
their title and you can see that we went

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,100
from individual items like a color or a

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,140
font or a list and now they're starting

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,180
to come together in various combinations

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,800
as molecules and organisms this is

00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,880
exactly what drees was talking about

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,110
this morning in the drapes note and

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,470
everything gets built out here and

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:09,390
another way to view it is up here we

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,500
have you can look at the dates and

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,390
there's actually a way the color coding

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,680
there's red and there's yellow and

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,630
there's green and you can actually use

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,440
it for either internal or external

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:23,080
approval so that as things get approved

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,840
you change the part of the file name so

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,790
it gets to say whether it's in progress

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,050
in review or completed and so that it

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,820
will change from red to yellow to green

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,440
so just by looking at it you can say oh

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,680
yeah the short date that's not done yet

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,270
but form items I mean this was done

00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,000
internally so there wasn't that process

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,470
but it is possible layout so you can

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,700
look at the display sweet layouts for

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,900
it's just that's a pure layout so

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,670
there's nothing really in there but

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,220
let's more interesting stuff you can see

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,660
that the homepage this is made up of

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,530
different atoms and molecules and

00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:00,169
organisms that are earlier this is pure

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:03,080
just an HTML generated a mock

00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:04,730
really and it can be used for client

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,320
approval they can see exactly how it's

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,340
going to work one of the other my

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,470
absolutely favorite thing is you can

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,909
test responsiveness so beautifully you

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,070
can see there slide it this way you can

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:19,580
see that things work at any given width

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:23,989
or you can just click you want to random

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:28,369
large size or go full pick a break point

00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:30,109
here I can put in 999 just like that

00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:33,730
that's pot in a lab it is an awesome

00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:35,600
tool you can see why we like it so much

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,269
I'm gonna flip back over terminal

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,419
alright mpm is done this run event and

00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:42,919
power install so barren style is X just

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,499
going to run and pull any dependencies

00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,980
for anything that I'm using for theming

00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:51,769
purposes for this purple it's just

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,299
grabbing bourbon neat most cases again

00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:54,350
not dictating how you guys work you

00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,210
would use whatever you're comfortable

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,070
it's game but it's a wave it's a package

00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,960
manager as well to be able to pull in

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,549
those particular components once I

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,369
actually have that done I can go ahead

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:06,590
and run gulp gulp is actually looking

00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:09,470
for SAS changes as looking for its

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,600
generating the pattern lab itself and as

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,279
that is sewing they're listening for

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,369
different events let me actually show

00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,529
you what that goal file looks like we've

00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:20,690
actually modeled us originally off of a

00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:23,509
Lexi's Gope file but I've actually

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,789
cleaned it up quite a bit and if you're

00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:33,950
not familiar with grunts or gulp just

00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:35,359
like everybody see that good better it's

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,190
just a way for you to be able to have

00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,509
processes running in the background that

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,090
are listening for different things and

00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:43,460
doing specific actions based off it so

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,600
I'm for instance here patterns change

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,049
I'm just listening to see if I've

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,899
changed a pattern Adam molecule organism

00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:52,429
inside of pattern lab and if so it'll

00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:54,619
actually go ahead and copy those

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:57,889
patterns as well as run some a couple of

00:20:54,619 --> 00:21:00,350
other things to generate the CSS when

00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:02,509
the SAS as well as also go out and clear

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,330
the drupal cash for me if there's a

00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:06,859
template change that needs to take place

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:10,730
this is a great way to kind of automate

00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:12,109
the friend in ops for you alright so now

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,299
that that's running let's go ahead and

00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:17,049
jump over to dripper

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:20,080
quick so in pattern lab itself for this

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:22,149
we have a particular layout okay bae

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,159
really basic simple header you got a

00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:27,970
menu item we have a four column layout

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:32,369
here of speakers so what happens it's

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,369
actually not four columns it's flexbox I

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:43,989
got your flex bucks so this is what it

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:46,239
looks like inside of pattern lab oh I'm

00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:49,960
sorry inside of drupal when you have

00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:53,440
actually enabled a theme so let me back

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:58,559
up real quick under appearance if we

00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:01,179
actually go to enable Bartok this is

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,340
demo God's bit me right now this is

00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:05,619
actually what is what it would look like

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,090
without you know it's not using the

00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:10,539
lovely and everybody like Bartik theme

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:14,440
right what you should like is the fact

00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:17,139
that it uses classy is right now what

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:25,840
classy is everybody know who built

00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:33,519
classy yeah yeah if you like it more

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:34,989
than if you hate hehe said John so basic

00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,289
Bartik theme of the box okay but when I

00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:41,129
actually go ahead and turn on the Big

00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:44,230
Easy theme and set this as the default

00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:47,139
and go back to the site it's picking up

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:49,509
exactly what was in pattern lab over in

00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:52,359
Drupal and by the way it did this

00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:55,690
without me actually touching a twig

00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:58,389
template in Drupal so what would happen

00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,460
if we went into pattern lab and changed

00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:04,359
I think this is an h3 or change it to an

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:08,409
h4 for the titles the the names what

00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:10,289
would happen if we did that no no you

00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:12,639
want me do that yeah okay I'll do all

00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:17,739
right so let's actually go and jump into

00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:19,269
pattern lab so a pattern lab source okay

00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,820
patterns this is where the actual

00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:24,850
patterns are taken care of okay atoms

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:27,920
molecules organisms templates

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,720
okay and the dribble templates itself

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,640
are sitting down here under templates

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,010
layout in patterns okay so if I actually

00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,280
want to make a change to this all I need

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:42,850
to know is actually where to go make

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:46,010
this a little bit bigger those organisms

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,710
so under meta I actually have note

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,090
speaker teaser HD no twig okay again

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,040
this is not in Drupal this is actually

00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,300
over in pattern lab we'll see what

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,090
happens to you when I make this change

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:59,300
so right now it's an h3 exchange I to an

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,590
h4 i'm going to hit save let me flip

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,570
back over to gulp so you can see what's

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:08,150
going on so it's detected to change and

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,320
there we go it is generated pattern lab

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,380
and it's actually gone and cleared to

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:18,560
cash so if i go back into pattern lab

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:23,020
first and refresh it was it hmm this one

00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,020
change well it's definitely a ch3 now

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:32,240
it's an H for now page for now all right

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,590
yes and drumroll italy what is it not

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,260
what is it now it's still in each is it

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:46,570
in each three it looks big enough to be

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:49,880
an h3 h3 Gavin refresh Asia right now

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:53,840
and now it's an h4 made one change in

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,370
pattern lab the processes and gulp made

00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:04,030
sure that that same change happened in

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:08,090
Drupal maji

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:09,830
and so you can extrapolate it I mean

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,440
that's a simple change age 42 age three

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,830
but any change like that is possible

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,940
adding a class adding a div adding any

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:22,730
kind of HTML structure whatsoever it can

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,350
be done themed in pattern lab and those

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:30,440
same changes in the structure will get

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:34,100
over into your Drupal templates so I was

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,970
expecting a whole more like what did you

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:41,030
all follow that yeah sorry are you as

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:44,620
excited about that as I am alright cool

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:48,620
d team wants goes everywhere right yeah

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,820
so we're going to make a couple small

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,080
other points and then we're going to

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,470
open up for questions because I hope you

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,260
have some questions so first of all form

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,120
one we are looking for front-end and

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,060
back-end developers junior and senior

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,280
level we have a great team so I thought

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,960
that was cool we get to do that snow

00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,490

also hear those these will be in the

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,050
slides these are some some important

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,150
links to Alexia's work first of all to

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,890
the standard pattern lab I think there

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,020
was some updates to the second one the

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:31,130
drupal lab they're on github by phase

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,500
two alexys work on the shila theme there

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,650
is a pattern lab chat room on git er

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,930
it's up there and then some links for

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:41,180
gesso we're going to be doing the Drupal

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,340
8 work and Jessica's coming out as soon

00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,220
as possible where as you can see we're

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,430
at work on it and we're going to have

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:51,560
what you saw tonight this afternoon

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:55,100
hopefully available for open source

00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:58,940
sharing and all that jazz within a month

00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,650
or so so questions and we can go back

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,650
and demo lots of different things yes

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,090
sir come to the microphone please and

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,600
anyone else who has a question if you

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:10,600
would happily line up at the microphone

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
hey

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,029
my name is Derek and just wanted to say

00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,580
thanks this is like really really

00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:20,620
freaking exciting yeah we just kind of

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,539
been like a brainchild brainstorm we've

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,330
been thinking about and looking at for a

00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:27,610
while not with pattern lab but we using

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:30,039
the templates between the prototype and

00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:33,279
style guide and actually in Drupal so

00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:37,210
awesome thank you the question that i

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,169
have is where you declare in drupal 8

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,299
we've been looking at doing this in

00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:42,580
drupal 7 a little bit in drupal a where

00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:44,980
are you declaring those templates that

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,700
live inside of the pattern lab directory

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,549
where you declaring that they exist on

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,259
that go file so that's a great question

00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:57,159
so if we actually go under look under

00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:58,330
organisms there it depends on what

00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,580
you're actually building so in this case

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,919
falling based off of alexia we're going

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,049
to be doing a lot of rearranging on this

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,169
but you can see under organisms there's

00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:10,690
this meta folder and inside here

00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:14,049
anything that it's seasoned Pat that its

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:17,019
seat notices in pattern lab that has da

00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:19,899
da showa twig when gulp runs if it sees

00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:21,789
a change to that it will notify Drupal

00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:23,559
and actually pull those over into the

00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:24,940
templates folder on Drupal side for us

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:27,669
so we don't want to have to that's like

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,289
calling them it's a it's a it's doing a

00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:30,879
copying but it's going am I having to

00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,129
actually go look at the pattern yeah

00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:34,600
copy the code out of there going to

00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:36,039
Drupal make the template so it's like

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,899
your face and they're piling it and say

00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:40,480
right I can go straight over into

00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:43,659
pattern lab in this case we're speaker

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,190
using cheese or display mode you get to

00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:47,440
have a little knowledge obviously of

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,539
what twigmyte call that template and

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,549
yeah turn on twig debugging you know and

00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:53,470
get a better insight into that but if

00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:54,669
you you know if you can take the speed

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,019
it up even more buttons but if you know

00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:58,269
in this case that is created no dash

00:28:56,019 --> 00:29:00,610
Jeff speaker dash teaser but that's not

00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,559
really the magic I mean we can undo copy

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,210
and paste right well could I could just

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,490
have it like look directly in that

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,110
directory for for the templates rather

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,970
than having a copy it so if you look

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,620
action so if you actually look here i

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,450
have know'd speaker teaser which is

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,120
actually extending so choosing twig

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,399
extend to actually extend that but I can

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,879
also use the data transformation plugin

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,200
to actually pop in additional references

00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:25,240
to in this case the atoms

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,860
to speak our image into the field

00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,169
speaker image field so it knows exactly

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,779
what display in Drupal or in this case

00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:34,000
field company for the company name I can

00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:35,740
pass the classes using attributes for

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,809
the class in this case no no doubt

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,880
speaker and control it on pattern labs

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:41,380
so as the front-end developers

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,909
especially if they know how to do any

00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,899
type of site building at all they're

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:45,519
already going to have these correlations

00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:46,750
running on your head you're like I'm

00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,580
gonna worry about over here Barton swim

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,899
do it over here and there's a build

00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,490
document for the site builder or the

00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:53,200
developer to just go build out the

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,450
content type when the contents diamond

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,860
and the theme is on it's already done

00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,330
over in pattern lab and it's already

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,039
gotten full pulled over automatically

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:05,769
into Drupal that's brilliant thank you

00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:07,809
so much thank you sometimes your pattern

00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:10,179
lab patterns might need to have

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:12,279
translations or links in them how are

00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:15,340
you handling the basically the trans

00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:17,409
function of the L are the link function

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,870
in the pattern lab patterns yeah that is

00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:21,399
a awesome question and something that we

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,220
haven't even considered yet like we said

00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:25,570
this is in the early infancy of this

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,679
concept but it's definitely some we're

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,480
going to need to take a look at because

00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,070
we partner with like lingotek to do

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,380
translation on stuff all the time so

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,360
it's definitely a concern it's a it's in

00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,440
the Drupal lab repo that you had post at

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,919
the end there we just got it in

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,330
yesterday so here that translation is

00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,299
now in there so we can actually pull

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:50,080
this in so all right oh I'll see you

00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:55,179
thank you bring that up hello hi John so

00:30:50,080 --> 00:31:00,909
with ya so much time is this a little

00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:03,070
bit however so Jubal seven is was

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:06,850
basically impossible to reuse templates

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,500
because we had TPL dot PHP sort of you

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:13,779
just couldn't use them they were awful

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:17,649
templates with twig we have a system

00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:20,620
that is did not come from Drupal so it's

00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:23,580
this this problem of how do you use the

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,230
same template in your style guide and

00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,809
inside your application which is Drupal

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:34,029
in this case is one that's solvable by

00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:36,729
just using twig and so

00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:39,489
there are two ways to solve this problem

00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:42,879
using twig and one is that you you use

00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:45,669
the exact same file and it's read by

00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:48,909
your style guide generator and it's also

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:51,039
read by Google right and what that means

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:53,649
is that you have to pull all the Drupal

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,039
bits out of your components and just

00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:59,499
have pure twig that's a route that I've

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,219
chosen go because it's really simple and

00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:05,830
you've decided to go with doing this

00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:08,919
data transformation and compiling it's

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:13,299
way harder and I'm wondering why you

00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:18,820
decided to do that it seems more more

00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:21,549
complicated convoluted and would require

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,559
me to like have to write PHP if I want

00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:26,229
to if I have any problems with the way

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,299
it works I don't know that you have to

00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:29,499
write any PHP it is well complicated I

00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:32,489
mean we talked a little in the hallway

00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:34,869
and you said use what KSS note for ya

00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:37,659
which which I've not tried yet but I'm

00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,969
actually now very curious we've been

00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:43,809
using a pattern lab in Drupal 7 with

00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:44,889
Drupal 7 for a while for for exactly

00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,570
what we show what I showed you earlier

00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:51,039
with the four on one site I've been

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:53,710
doing that for over a year now with with

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:59,320
a the pattern of that version for gesso

00:32:53,710 --> 00:33:01,509
in Drupal 7 and it allows me to outside

00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,549
of twig because we're using the mustache

00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:06,219
version to completely componentized uh

00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:08,499
the entire website and how I think and

00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:10,330
so for us it was just an now that

00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:12,489
there's pattern lat for twig Drupal 8

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:16,839
and twig it was just a natural next step

00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:18,580
if there were other avenues we haven't

00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:20,889
explored them yet did you have something

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,690
I think they know no I i know i really

00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:24,339
like you can earlier too I really feel

00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,960
like you could simplify your your Pat

00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:28,089
look continue to use pattern map yeah

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:33,609
but simply by the way that your workflow

00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:35,859
actually is bye and then this is like

00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:39,629
super new idea that I just started doing

00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:39,629
three weeks ago so

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:48,620
yeah I'm gonna have a couple different

00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:53,360
box about that this week but what would

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:54,710
be there cuz I'm yeah yeah so twig is

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,200
super powerful and I think that you

00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:59,120
could simplify your process just by

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,840
yanking out the Drupal bits and then

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,870
leaving them in the HTML twig file and

00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,480
then creating just pure components using

00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:11,510
vanilla twig hmm and then you just route

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,820
the Drupal variables then into your

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,500
components rather than trying to do

00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,720
these data transformations we have to

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,700
write PHP to do that no okay you just

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,590
write twig right that it's vanilla to it

00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,300
hmm we will be a trip off and we can

00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:28,100
explore this further no it's but thank

00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,600
you it's great great points Thanks we're

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,960
actually doing something super similar

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,460
as well phase 2 and red hat yeah we're

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,350
doing indie seven though so it's really

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,020
cool to see the implementation and da I

00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,310
was curious how you go about

00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,350
instantiating the fields and Drupal does

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,350
your JSON actually define the fields and

00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,060
do they show up in Drupal there's the

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,490
field right there so do you have to do

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,320
anything else to get it to exist in the

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:53,720
database no I just got to print out

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,610
content and the content attribute here

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,960
actually will bring this actually into

00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,580
the twig template and being on the

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,020
Drupal site or on the paddle abside

00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,340
coupon oh yeah I mean you're still doing

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,040
your developers still doing site

00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,330
building so they're telling you hey or

00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,370
in this case we have a lot of fun

00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,770
developers that were like why do I need

00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,330
a developer to work on that because I

00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,070
know how to do create a content type and

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,420
especially Drupal I everything's feel

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,800
double so it makes it much easier where

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,140
it's a content type with its paragraph

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,400
bundle whether it's a block well we're

00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,690
actually so we're using the paragraphs

00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,670
module and we wrote something called

00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:25,280
pattern build or importer that watches

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,220
the JSON files and imports and creates

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,990
those database fields and Drupal hmm and

00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,210
make sure that they reuses them properly

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,190
if it already exists but we can define

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,580
all the same like components and reuse

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,330
them in patterns and come

00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:41,490
different ways so yeah so form one calm

00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,740
which we release him jubilate anybody

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,260
want to guess how that was built that's

00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,390
a giant node with paragraph bundles so

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,820
everything's componentized yeah every

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,100
and every page on the site is like that

00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,330
and yeah I mean there's it and I'm sure

00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,770
as two schools of that some people hate

00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,750
paragraphs some people have paragraphs

00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,930
but it forgot bundles if you haven't

00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,310
worked with it really kind of works

00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,840
hand-in-hand with our lab as far as how

00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,580
you would might component eyes things

00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,000
and I don't know about you but like I

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,560
hate filled collections all that other

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,700
stuff to get super got another people

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,110
ask questions but I wondered if you

00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,470
could show that admin side of it too

00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:18,060
like your editor danman side of like

00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,050
with your actually constant editor and

00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:25,280
you're managing a piece of content oh

00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:31,350
just just looks like you would any other

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:34,320
content type so there's the speaker

00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:36,180
content type there's field company field

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,340
speaker image so as long as the front

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,480
end developer is this is only place

00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,150
where they actually have to communicate

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,430
with you back end developer still it's

00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,530
kidding as long as they know what the

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,440
field names are in this case we have

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:51,920
knowed speaker a note speaker teaser

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,960
twig that is say that three times fast

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,670
that's extending the HTML template but

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,190
we also have a JSON file so as long as

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,530
we are utilizing JSON and passing the

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,420
content with those field names we can

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,060
put text values in there we can

00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:08,360
reference other patterns inside a

00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,250
pattern lab itself in this case an image

00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,330
so that it then pulls through and then

00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,930
those actually you're just getting

00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:22,520
written you know that back into here as

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:22,520
well so yes yeah

00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:32,140
yeah into the bike please so that the

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,140
people in the recording is it working

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,130
hahaha what was that one more time so is

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,930
the work being duplicated so when the

00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,810
window contents being entered into the

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:47,390
admin area it's not dynamically creating

00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:49,190
variables or anything in that JSON so no

00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,710
that's done manually right now it's

00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,450
manually yeah ok so here so here's the

00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,270
thing let's take pattern lab out of the

00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:59,060
whole equation perimeter if I want to

00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:02,750
create if I want to create a twig

00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:05,450
template for specific page I number one

00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:07,700
have to know what Drupal is using to

00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:10,540
display that content if I want to

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:13,400
override court not hack or override core

00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:15,320
then I need to make a copy that into my

00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,200
theme make sure I use one of the file

00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,359
name suggestions so that process you

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,940
have to do already so what we said was

00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,440
well why do that process why the

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,880
front-end developers do something

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,650
similar especially if it when it were

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,750
rigidly was a mustache haven't do it in

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,290
twig oh how can we marry the two

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,570
together and have it so that once I had

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,450
once once that template exists already

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,940
in pattern lab just cup and in fact I'm

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,980
having some brain thought based on what

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,840
John I talked about we probably would

00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,369
need to do that part because Drupal

00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,810
doesn't care where the twig template is

00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,609
as long as it finds it inside your team

00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:54,050
so i think i might just eliminated a

00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:56,450
step thank you John so is your so you're

00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,220
limiting that that step yes you may have

00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,890
to do it first in patter lab but it's

00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,570
copying over now I'm just if I want to

00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,130
add it change the heading like you saw

00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,170
when i add a class following that

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,460
additional markup i'm doing it over in

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,290
pattern lab with a front-end developer

00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,850
has full control over it and the clients

00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:14,450
generally seeing that before they even

00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:16,670
see what's happening in drupal gulp runs

00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:20,900
now it's over and drupal don't worry

00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:24,200
about it thank you you know what RX

00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,119
please sorry son haha i got my speaking

00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,130
of it no so I'm looking at it and I oh

00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:29,390
that dogs all good but so one of the

00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,310
things up in the experiment with the

00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,990
last couple of months actually ever

00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,640
since we reorganized all the file

00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:38,460
structures in for classy and all that

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,100
call but and I see this file structure

00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,780
is very specific is there any way of

00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,850
mapping yourself out of it so let's say

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,190
I come in with a theme that is that map

00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:50,070
Doppler complete other way is there any

00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,840
way of like saying hey my where are my

00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,940
files that do they have always to live

00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,320
in this file structure can I break that

00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,150
completely and move stuff around this

00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,860
don't want to so talk about the file

00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,370
structure for pattern lab or for the

00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,230
theme or for all of it oh god it's take

00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:06,810
do we where we end up having like two

00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,430
different ways of thinking up if I begin

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,920
to reorganize my stuff do I end up

00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:13,080
getting caught up in this is pattern lab

00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,550
structure fair enough that's no fun if

00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,430
we know that the room that what which

00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:22,410
hopefully in a big one second there

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:24,780
there is a config config yamo so this is

00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,060
the four pattern at the config yamo

00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:31,500
which is showing for example the public

00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:35,450
directory the source directory whether

00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:38,190
using twig auto escape to a debug and

00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,870
style um no where's other things like oh

00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,450
yeah you can't wit debug inside of hang

00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,250
on if you really want to but but the

00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,650
actual structure what you're asking no

00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,210
it doesn't matter at all I just drop in

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,160
Hollywood my theme is yeah and then we

00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,870
just rolled with it that's it that's the

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,670
power of the starter kits is that you

00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,110
take your theme however it is and you

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,490
dropping your starter kit and you need

00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:59,040
patterns which are going to mimic what

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,630
you think Drupal is going to be giving

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,000
you so we're not gonna have issues with

00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,920
people coming in saying hey I built my

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,990
stuff this way and all my files are

00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,670
living over here and my image files just

00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,380
living in the same folders and like

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,960
doing these season those things and I

00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,300
can like pretty easily important that

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,460
structure that structure should stay

00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,330
intact you put you bring in pattern lab

00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:24,000
inside your theme doc rude if you don't

00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,040
want it in your repo get ignore fine

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,760
same thing if you can use a starter kit

00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,170
to have this all work together so yeah

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,490
it doesn't care doesn't care how your

00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,470
theme is building so we can actually end

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,810
up opting out of paddle if you like no I

00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,730
want to use your paddle that too because

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,260
matlab choose way more epic or somebody

00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,730
else put something completely new so you

00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,890
don't end up getting caught up in the

00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,890
system there are independent sweet

00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:51,240
hey I'm really excited about this

00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:54,779
concept looking forward to implementing

00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,789
it where I work and I just had a couple

00:41:54,779 --> 00:42:00,509
questions about the compiler that you're

00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:04,140
using from pattern lab zao would suggest

00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:05,640
using compass and I see you're using

00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:11,430
gulp and I just wondered if there were

00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:16,109
any drawbacks so we where's either

00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:18,029
quickly moving away from compass just

00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:22,470
because of Ruby dependencies on

00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:25,259
compiling so we use lips ass so as far

00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:28,200
as gulp versus grunt it's apples and

00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:31,140
oranges in fact in production we use

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,309
grunts JavaScript ass builder just

00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,769
because we have some a lot of other

00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:37,079
things with our vagrant incidents on our

00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:38,700
virtual machine and doing things like

00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,660
actually installing those dependencies

00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,660
and building them

00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:54,430
more magic hahaha I did that on purpose

00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:58,390
that too in delight there you go thank

00:42:54,430 --> 00:43:01,930
you short answer it's dead cool it's

00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:06,400
dying any other questions yeah okay

00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:10,420
before we go we gotta think of some good

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,660
questions so I just released a Drupal 8

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,329
deeming with twig book that's available

00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:19,599
i actually have one two three i have six

00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:20,890
digital copies here i mean i could just

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,150
hide it to the front you guys had open

00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:26,650
up your computers and just pass it all

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,880
the way back to but obviously not in it

00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:32,079
for the money I'm and to give back to

00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:36,519
the community so help me think of a

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:39,910
question sugar oh dude my brain is fried

00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:49,539
what is more Morton cadences what is

00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:56,230
more his favorite color hahaha who said

00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:59,619
that in the back there you go yes very

00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:03,730
specific answer yes come come come get

00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:09,549
the digital copy ba dee a 55 in case and

00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:10,989
no one heard that make sure you raise

00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:13,680
your hand that deathless I forgot to

00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,680
mention the rules

00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:23,410
last call for questions are there any

00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:30,070
more questions and the yes sir come up

00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:31,750
to the mic yeah to the mic please my

00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:35,050
question is basically just in pattern

00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:38,140
lab in general as using it as a kind of

00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:41,190
a mock-up tool to show a client do you

00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:44,050
ever use it and like fully style it

00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:46,359
using the CSS but instead of just

00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,460
showing it as a black and white kind of

00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:50,109
wireframe do you ever go all out with

00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,520
full style and then like post it

00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:53,680
somewhere so they can take a look at it

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,349
yes yeah that's that is how we use it

00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,010
it's a it's you all components fully

00:44:56,349 --> 00:45:02,619
themed out components brought together

00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,960
from molecules organisms to templates to

00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:07,630
pages and what gets reviewed by the

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,060
client I mean the the components I

00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:12,190
review with the designer and the UX

00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,840
person so like component you can go

00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,760
access our pattern lab for form one

00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,820
right now just by going to themes just

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,470
apparently public index.html every

00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,240
single component that needed to be there

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:24,310
this and this is the power with pattern

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,740
lab is I don't need to create it create

00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:29,470
PSD photo shops schedule whatever you're

00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,240
using pages from every single thing

00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:34,330
because if you really take a look and

00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,640
break down a site it's reusing 70 my

00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:38,500
purse exactly though yes a melon so the

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,240
button I mean this is a special button

00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:45,580
probably because of the icon button

00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,030
button register but all the button

00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:50,200
styles are gonna be the same everywhere

00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:54,070
but what we show the client though of

00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:56,320
course is going to be the individual

00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,760
pages they're not going to often they're

00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,109
not going to make as much sense of the

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,359
actual components the components are

00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:03,160
more for internal review because once I

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,369
is a front-end developer get my designer

00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,589
to sign off on a component when she

00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:10,480
comes back when if she wants off on one

00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:11,770
comp this is 10 pixels that way or

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,990
temperatures that way I make the

00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:15,339
executive decision and like she's

00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:18,160
already signed off on it we don't have

00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:21,250
to waste time it's not a pixel perfect

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,930
anymore because more general rules I

00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:26,410
will frequently go to my designers and

00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,570
say let's pick a generic margins like so

00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,809
in the right column what's the distance

00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:32,239
between pains

00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:34,640
is it 20 pixels of 40 pixels of 4 m's I

00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,469
don't care but that's going to be

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,660
standardized and I don't care what's in

00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:40,939
the comp she has three different items

00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,189
in the right sidebar that's the gutter

00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:46,339
between them right right its general as

00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:47,809
much generic rules that's what pattern

00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:50,869
lab really helps you enforce and it

00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:52,729
helps the designers understand they see

00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:54,170
it may go oh this is somewhat you know

00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:58,130
because they're just dumping stuff

00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:01,430
sometimes into PSD files and but it's if

00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:02,719
you're a completely pedantic like I am

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:06,049
when it comes to front-end development I

00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:08,630
want as few rules as possible i'm going

00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:10,789
for the fewest lines of code the fewest

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:12,890
bart the smallest markup and the ease

00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:15,680
list main is most easily maintainable

00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,989
least breakable by the client I mean all

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,150
of these things go into how I envisioned

00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:22,880
it and pattern lab allows me to execute

00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:25,939
that and test it and then it's done

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,099
almost never is something that I've

00:47:25,939 --> 00:47:31,430
built in pattern lab a month later

00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:33,079
further and development break because

00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,809
you've thought about it in individual

00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,219
pieces so you can go from having kind of

00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:38,869
a black and white thing this is what

00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:40,670
we're generally thinking then actually

00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:41,839
show them full design and then when

00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,539
you're ready to actually put it into

00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,859
Drupal just kind of use that same CSS

00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:47,329
that you were already using just kind of

00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:49,880
dump it in yeah and it's the same

00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:52,609
selectors well exactly ripples using the

00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,019
same CSS that pattern ram is because

00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:55,849
it's inside our theme for oh so you just

00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:57,199
told it to look in that CSS as well

00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:58,609
what's the same since the same see us in

00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,769
Drupal 8 that's what we're showing is it

00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:03,799
so much simpler Drupal 7 I have to use

00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:05,869
you know display sweet and panels claim

00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:08,209
markup and all of these other tools to

00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:10,670
really you know massage the mark-up to

00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:12,019
get close as close as possible to what i

00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:14,689
did in pattern that and sometimes it's

00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:17,059
not possible but in Drupal 8 I mean

00:48:14,689 --> 00:48:20,329
that's that's the magic here is that

00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:22,309
it's the same right cool yeah thanks

00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:29,900
thank you a great question here there

00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:35,209
you go oh very nice very nice next

00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:40,160
question hey my name is Rob um I the OA

00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:42,900
thank you thank you so so pattern lab it

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:48,720
was originally written in PHP

00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:51,990
someone ported it to nodejs so are you

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,480
using the PHP / room here pattern lab or

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,920
this node that raising the ph fear the

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,010
note the node.js version i'm pretty sure

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,319
it's than nodejs person yeah yeah yeah

00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:03,480
hello NPM install and all that generates

00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:08,400
right now so people have done some work

00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:11,400
to port twig over to note as well so

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,480
what kind of parody is there is there

00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,099
any way that we could use the node

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:21,180
version alongside the page is that just

00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:24,750
kind of crazy am I going into alien

00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:26,640
territory here yeah I totally worth

00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,940
discussing and we hadn't thought that

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,460
far yeah yeah yeah it's a great question

00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,980
I oh I personally am looked at deepest

00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,740
daddy because we just picked the flavor

00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,510
we want yeah so it's the PHP version

00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,940
that you are installing into the team

00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,799
here and then oh this is no jeaious okay

00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,210
yeah all right yeah all right

00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:47,039
interesting because you were running

00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:50,130
installing what were you installing with

00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,349
composer at that point then oh so when

00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,640
you first install pattern lab when you

00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:55,770
when you actually go to get refund bolt

00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,390
pattern i'm down you would run composer

00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:59,640
install today go and grabbing all the

00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,960
dependencies that pattern lab needs and

00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,359
then pattern one actually has a

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,490
generator inside that so it's behind the

00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:07,619
scenes is actually doing PHP core I

00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:11,730
don't lab general see I see all right

00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:13,170
thanks yep you're welcome so you

00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,210
mentioned the one of the benefits of

00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,859
this is being able to get to the the

00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:18,809
front end portion of this earlier

00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,730
without having a site building portion

00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:22,289
is there and you mentioned clearly

00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,440
talking with the developer to talk to

00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:27,569
see field names etc to make this easily

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,339
pour it over how do you handle that from

00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:32,849
a front-end perspective if I'm given a

00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:35,400
project and I know nothing about it do

00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:37,529
you spec out those field names ahead of

00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,380
time and then give that to the front end

00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:42,059
developer or yeah so so as a tech both

00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,250
up my check our cad on real quick so as

00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:45,750
a kind of architect i would meet with a

00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,579
client we'd have a kickoff meeting

00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:50,010
through that iteration process whether

00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:52,799
its content strategy whether it's UX we

00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:54,420
start to form a picture of identifying

00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,980
what content types what field should be

00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,000
with those content types and then i

00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,350
would actually generate or

00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,230
another tech ark would actually generate

00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:03,450
a build document that is simply really

00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,590
just an Excel spreadsheet or a google

00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,900
doc and whatever you want to wherever

00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:09,030
you want to use that has the content

00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,260
type has the field listings in there the

00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,520
other things as at a car could be our

00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,590
responsibility to make sure we look at

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,510
sea drupal 7 we were more field

00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:17,520
independent meaning we really be

00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,780
specific with our fields the way with

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,820
configuration management actually works

00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,320
in Drupal 8 now we actually really try

00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,470
to reuse our fields because I don't want

00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,630
to have 100 field twig templates I'm

00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:30,990
sure Morgan can can can agree with that

00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:32,100
one so we'll use those fields across but

00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,140
those will all will be doing identified

00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:36,570
head so well now hey for instance for

00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:40,230
the speaker that's because a name a bio

00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:42,960
an image the company oh and by the way

00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,370
that bought that image I have both fall

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,370
for the content types going to use an

00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:49,890
image field they're all going to look

00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,810
the same meaning it's a file a file

00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,370
upload for an image and I can create

00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:55,770
whatever display modes I need for that

00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:57,180
to have them be different sizes use

00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,200
break point whatever for Responsible

00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,150
points to make sure a different image

00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,590
styles load so I'm going to reuse that

00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,230
same field image across those five

00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:06,150
content types as well so I don't know

00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,320
hopefully I don't yeah so that that

00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,120
basically means that you're dictating

00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,710
what the components are before it hits

00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,660
the front end know the clients dictating

00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,430
what the what should be there through

00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,920
there through discussion with them of

00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:19,500
what's what that content looks like in a

00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,790
wireframe more likely and what fields

00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,220
that the content strategist is

00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:26,070
identified from there yep the machine

00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,900
names for the fields yeah we but I mean

00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:30,120
what are you gonna call a field image

00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:33,180
that besides film image right right okay

00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,980
cool but the front end developer can go

00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,210
ahead and build some of those out ahead

00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,490
of time if you have to change it in the

00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:40,440
twig template to change from field image

00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,620
to field featured image I mean just

00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,940
because that's what the dev that's not

00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,500
that big of a deal you've already themed

00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,720
it you already know what its gonna look

00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,150
like you're just changing a class name

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,920
that's not maybe the file maybe it's not

00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,170
that complicated by night in class name

00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,360
just yeah just changing the attribute

00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,710
and then JSON file you saw that's right

00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,550
that's all right fielding so there you

00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:04,590
go sir general question about pattern

00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,930
lab so when you're building these out

00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:08,740
for the client or for yourselves the

00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:11,730
components

00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,840
the atoms the molecules in the organisms

00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,690
you know are you building them page

00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:20,800
first and then kind of dividing it out

00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:23,350
back backwards or myself no I actually

00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,540
um prefer to work with the designer I

00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:29,410
get basically a style guide and I theme

00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:31,119
that out like like this all I start I

00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:33,220
literally start here with the colors and

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,470
then the fonts and then I work my way

00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:37,210
because once i get my way down all of

00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:42,070
these basic things there's form elements

00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:43,330
in here and that begins to and where the

00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:46,170
form elements so he goes through the

00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:48,550
formality past month did I did oh

00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:51,490
because of components in here from the

00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:53,080
atoms form the layout there we go all I

00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:57,280
kills him hear it from the components

00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:58,900
and that you know so generally try to

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,400
start as small as possible because

00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,990
you're building on top of it because

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,090
you're just not something I was like

00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:05,619
going shopping okay all right you know

00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,940
already know my apple my orange gonna

00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:08,680
look like I'm gonna make a fruit salad

00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,180
I'm just gonna grab the Apple already

00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,640
and the orange i already had in there i

00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,350
got this search Part robably a little

00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,970
high because it's probably a container

00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:20,470
around it that it's expecting that's not

00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:22,630
there but you can see that so all of

00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:24,850
this stuff the pagination it's all can

00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:27,280
be themed before you even look at any

00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:30,010
trip will install right you still and

00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,540
then then I usually go from there to the

00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,180
header and the footer make sure that

00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:37,900
responsive using all of the great tools

00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:39,850
here in pattern lab so that all the

00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,460
response so that I do the mobile menu I

00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:44,290
do all of that stuff and then you start

00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,550
off with a couple your dear cheezer's
