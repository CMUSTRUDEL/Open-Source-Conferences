Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Entities 101 : Understanding Data Structures in Drupal
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Nodes, content entities, config entities, pages... what? For people new to Drupal, and even those that have been around awhile, the weird naming of these things can be confusing. In this session, we will be learning about the different data structures in Drupal, how they work, and when to use them.

well welcome I hope you're enjoying the

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:11,280
warmth pretty good

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,490
well since I'm getting antsy I'm gonna

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,450
go ahead and just get started officially

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,789
so this is a point where they would

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,150
probably actually start the recording

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,240
when they cut it down later so the

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,640
session we're here today is entities 101

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,400
understanding data structures in Drupal

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,500
as I kind of mentioned before data

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,360
structures are really critical not only

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,770
to understanding how Drupal works but

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,989
also how to make really good use of it

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,079
I've seen people come in and do things

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:44,550
not understanding how Drupal works that

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,160
were interesting but potentially really

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,390
bad idea is really painful someone was

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,550
telling me yesterday that they saw

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,219
someone that had created content types

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,829
that had fields for different regions of

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,469
the page and they were dropping in just

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,899
HTML in order to get things to do what

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,619
they wanted which is very interesting

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,500
and really kind of defeats the purpose

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,240
to a certain extent so I put this

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,619
together as a way to kind of talk about

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,259
how structured data works how entities

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,900
work now that we're kind of fully mature

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,509
in the space with d8 and to do this from

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,240
a level that's not overly technical I

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,259
think I've got one slide that has some

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,200
pseudocode

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,040
but everything else is very high level

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,479
and so when you come out of here then

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,159
you should be able to tell people very

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,350
quickly and easily exactly what an

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,119
entity is exactly is a relative term and

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,770
hopefully you'll be doing so and it

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,070
should be fairly fairly fun as we go

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,479
along so Who am I why am I here why

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,000
should you even consider listening to me

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,759
my name is Ron I work for aqueous

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,509
solutions architect basically that's a

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,369
really fancy title for problem solver

00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:02,759
quite literally so I work mostly with

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,079
the the sales guys and girls and when

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,869
we're out in the field talking to people

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,280
and large organizations about Drupal and

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,849
why they should use it instead of

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,160
proprietary platforms my job is to do

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,170
demos answer technical questions

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,750
make sure that the sales reps are

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,180
telling the truth those kinds of things

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,970
and I've been using Drupal since

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,160
four-point-seven I actually got into

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,460
freelance development for a while had a

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,210
small dev shop I left to go work for a

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,880
company called Jackson River that has a

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,110
distribution for nonprofits and was a

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,180
senior developer and tech lead over

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,020
there for a while and then I went from

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:46,050
there to aqua abouts almost almost two

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,090
years ago so this is where I am online

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,590
if you ever need to yell at me about

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,130
something

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,620
RL Northcutt and rth dutt is pretty much

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,470
where you can find me so if you've got

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,010
that you've got me if you have any

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,390
questions about anything in general it's

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,310
one thing that kind of blows people's

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,500
minds and almost every single meeting

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm in I give them my card and I say hey

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,880
if you have questions about aqueous let

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,700
me know if you have questions outside of

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,950
Berkeley about Drupal let me know like

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,590
seriously like yeah it's seriously great

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:24,780
cuz we're all in the we're on the same

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:28,350
team okay but before we go too far what

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,910
is an entity right now I'm assuming most

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:37,140
everybody here has a concept has a

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:40,800
concept of what entities are and what

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,420
that means but in order to understand

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,370
where we are right now with entities

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,959
it's very helpful especially for folks

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,420
that haven't been around since four or

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,570
five to kind understand how we got here

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,800
because this wasn't like Drees woke up

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,860
one day and said oh I know we're gonna

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,230
make entities entities was a result of

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,660
an evolution in the Drupal space over

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,640
time and a lot of people scratching

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,250
their own itch and doing what they

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,530
needed to do grabbing ideas doing

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,910
different things and eventually we kind

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,250
of all started coming together and say

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,360
okay well let's let's codify some of

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,430
this and let's get on the same page

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,790
because there's some inefficiencies that

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,609
are coming from that so going way way

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,540
back before my time and d3 and earlier

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,390
all you had were nodes and no

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,540
were pretty basic there wasn't a whole

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:32,660
lot you could do in d4 we got this idea

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,630
of flexi node and that's where kind of

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,580
like the the initial entity started

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,860
climbing out of the primordial ooze

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,230
right it's still not super functional

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,710
but now we're starting to get in the

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,930
idea of having different types of things

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,960
that store different types of pages and

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,510
information one of the big things that

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,060
happen in d5 was the the content

00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,140
construction kit and that that kind of

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,880
set off this whole kind of race where

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,400
people were starting to really get this

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,380
idea of making things feel double of

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,180
actually being able to easily go in and

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,340
create different types of content

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,100
without necessarily always having to

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,650
code because before that if you wanted a

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,080
specific type of form to create a

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,880
specific type of content most of the

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,690
time you pretty much had to write PHP

00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,390
and that's not the most friendly way to

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,510
get into it this was kind of codified a

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:33,490
bit when we got into joopa 6 and we got

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:36,890
this concept of node types as well as

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,920
combining that with fields still called

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,840
CCK and that's where things really

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,510
started getting exciting because now

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,520
without having a touch code you can go

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,830
in and you cricut can create different

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,480
types of nodes because that's all we

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,550
really were still working we had users

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,320
me at techsan of it but but nodes and

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,630
then we could add different types of

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,670
fields to those and it was very very

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,070
exciting it was very very useful and

00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,880
again people started finding all kinds

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:08,510
of use cases and we started to note all

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,300
the things so content profile node

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,810
comment taxonomy node these are all

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,120
modules in 6 where people were trying to

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,910
kind of mash together the stuff they

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,330
liked about fields and nodes into other

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,750
things and not the most efficient way to

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,100
do things it worked was a bit clunky

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,080
sometimes it could be a bit gnarly when

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,770
you got done the depths of it but

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,650
overall that was kind of very clear on

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:41,400
where things were going so in Indy

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:44,400
seven which was kind of like a big step

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,669
in in moderation with regard to Drupal

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,560
itself we actually started this with nad

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:55,680
API now entities in were available in

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,780
core but we didn't still have a fully

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,990
robust 80 API was still pretty basic but

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,490
entity API as a contributor which was

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,650
intended to kind of fill the gap and

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,690
round things out so a lot of times you

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,449
would end up and you do end up in seven

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,120
having to install an ad API because it's

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:18,120
required by something else that's

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,919
relying on those things but this is

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,780
where we started to really kind of get

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,070
this idea of kind of simplifying down

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,639
and making everything entities so users

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:32,070
terms comments all of those things

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,410
became entities and now because they

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,840
were we could start to use some of the

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,090
same API is like fields and we start

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,970
being able to add fields to things so

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:46,139
anybody that was here in six and

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,120
remembers user profiles and six probably

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,580
using something like content profile or

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,169
profile node and then coming into seven

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,510
with users that had fields does anybody

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,539
remember that kind of being an aha

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,849
moment it was like okay now now I get it

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:02,550
now we're onto something

00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:06,240
exactly so all of that was great

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,250
d7 is wonderful still a great system but

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,110
now we have d8 and in d8 we've taken

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:14,070
that concept and it's actually kind of

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,099
evolved to be what the vision has kind

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,590
of slowly become and so that's kind of

00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,960
where we've come now and again this is

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,449
this whole ramp as we've kind of grown

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,159
through this process organically we've

00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,560
started to see this we started to get

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,050
ideas people started branching out doing

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,370
their own thing and then of course we

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,500
all realized that that was just the

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,789
direction everybody was going so we need

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,229
to get on the same page so a quick

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,200
little disclaimer this is a little weird

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,839
some people maybe others probably not

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,270
but there are actually in a two types of

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,650
entities there are content entities

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,300
which is what most of us probably

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,390
traditionally think about

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,830
so that would be no juicer sturms blocks

00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,120
and then there are config entities

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,720
config entities are what we're using for

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,390
CMI so we can export our configuration

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,510
into code so it's nut doesn't always

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:13,320
live in the database we're really just

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:16,770
talking primarily about content entities

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,620
today so config entities is kind of

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:23,550
another thing there's some similarities

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:26,850
there's some differences we can get into

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:29,460
that later if necessary but just for

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,650
this purpose of today just so that you

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,420
understand that so when you're talking

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,160
to people about entities and they say

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,390
entity then you can say oh you're

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,470
talking about content entities are

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,970
configured at ease because you know

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,420
those are two different things you know

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,530
and then they'll be like wow I need to I

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,450
need to get the business card of this

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:50,310
person so this is the official

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,310
definition of an entity if you go online

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:56,040
you go the entity API documentation so

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,020
entities are objects that are used for

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,370
persistent storage of content and

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,140
configuration information very nice very

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,800
clean kind of boring

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:10,950
I wouldn't expect anyone to necessarily

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,300
remember exactly what the words are for

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,890
this so I found another definition

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,440
that's I think a little bit more

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:22,290
friendly and what I did is I went back

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,350
and I found the original patch 2009 that

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:29,220
Fran doe added a patch for entities and

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,190
in his description he says naming in

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,400
this patch I went with entity which is a

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:38,760
loadable thingy that can optionally be

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,680
feel double and if you take nothing else

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,980
away from this then I hope you remember

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,790
that an entity is a loadable thingy that

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,560
is optional II feel double I do think

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,720
it's interesting he says that you know

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,090
let's not get caught up on the name it's

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,080
just something I came up with we can

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,460
correct that later obviously it's still

00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,800
entity so if anybody's got a better idea

00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,180
for what to call entities there are a

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,550
couple issues I can point you at and you

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,510
can go argue back in

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:10,430
all day long okay so coming back around

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:15,350
again the reason we're here and what

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,550
we're talking about what is an entity so

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,910
let's break it down a little bit and

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,920
entity is a thingy and I've got a nice

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:25,130
little thingy that I created over there

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,010
kind of a visual guide but basically an

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,790
entity is a just a piece of structured

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:35,980
data content like blog post or an

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:40,850
article a user a single taxonomy term

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,529
some other structured data now this is

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,640
where the terms can kind of get a little

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:48,410
weird and I will forgive you if you are

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,060
a little fuzzy with them if you will

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,720
forgive me if I'm a little fuzzy with

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:57,589
them sometimes but content broadly

00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,890
speaking is not an entity and a node is

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:04,040
not an entity it's a type of entity but

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:06,860
a specific article on space monkey

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,860
jumpsuits is an entity because that is a

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,010
thing it is a single atomic unit of

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,200
structured data so kind of weird I know

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,990
because we're talking about entities and

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,000
entity API and types of entities and all

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,520
of those things but just remember

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,770
generally speaking when we say entity as

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,760
a single thing we are talking about a

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:31,339
specific single thing in this case an

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,200
article on spaceman monkey jumpsuits

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:39,529
I would actually read that okay so

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,420
entities are loadable thingies so what

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:44,540
that means is that we've got a common

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,480
set of tools for getting that data in

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,399
and out of the database and of course

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,750
now with eight we also have some common

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,209
ways of getting it in and out of the

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,579
system entirely some wonderful wonderful

00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,959
things going on in that space so this is

00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:00,560
the pseudo code I mean actually it's

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,110
actually real code but outside of the

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,079
context of everything else there's

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,930
actually at least two or three different

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,029
ways to do each one of these steps so

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,690
there's multiple ways to create or load

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:18,380
or update or delete an entity I chose

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:21,410
the ones that were pretty easy to get

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,210
and made a lot of sense so as you can

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,670
see it's pretty straightforward so

00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:28,550
creating an entity is as simple as

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,620
calling a function telling it what type

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,530
of entity you want and then passing the

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,000
structured data into it now obviously

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,210
you have to know what that data

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,390
structure looks like good thing is we've

00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,770
got the the UI to kind of abstract that

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,610
out for us and it takes care of all of

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,220
those things

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,460
same thing with loading you just need to

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,470
know the type and the specific ID saving

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,710
is easy because once you actually have

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,450
that entity created then you can

00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,700
actually call that method and I just

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,310
want to save this I want to delete it

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,650
etc so and actually if you look at the

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:07,070
update you could call an entity into

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,510
being in code with that first line or

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,670
the second if you know specifically

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,250
which one you can make changes to that

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,720
entity and then you can save it then you

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,220
can go back make more changes and you

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,470
can save it again and you can keep doing

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,330
that as much as you want it's very

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,580
lovely

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:26,060
now there are a few common properties

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:29,060
across all entities every entity has an

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,640
ID it's got a little flag that tells us

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,820
if it's new or not and one of the I

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,790
think most useful and most exciting

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,670
things is that now that we have views in

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,570
core now that we have services in core

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:46,460
all of that is integrated with entities

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,780
so again if you go back into some of the

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:53,390
stuff in d7 or before that before we

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:57,710
even had entity API when you are trying

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,210
to if you had some custom type of data

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,710
that you were storing somehow in the

00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,170
database and you wanted to be able to

00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,360
access that you had to create your own

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,130
integration for views if you wanted to

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,690
use views and then you had to debug that

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,700
and then you had to maintain it and when

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,050
things changed or you found a better way

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,180
to do this because you went to a session

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,590
that told you you had to go and maintain

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,690
that now you don't have to worry about

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,790
any of that as long as you're following

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,220
the the API and you're just creating

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,370
entities in the normal way then all of

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,030
that integration comes out of the box so

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,290
actually let's see a quick quick

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,270
question how many people here have

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,270
created a content type

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,580
drupal okay

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:41,150
most folks and how many people here have

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:44,030
created a view in drupal okay so

00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:46,790
basically you've done most everything

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:50,620
here whether you realize it or not which

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,880
is the exciting fun thing okay so this

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,020
this may look kind of scary there's a

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,730
lot of stuff here but you don't have to

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,790
worry about most of this and this is

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,890
really more for reference but again

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,530
remember an entity is a loadable thingy

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:07,370
that's optional II feel double so you

00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:09,260
don't have to add fields to an entity to

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,080
make use of it and we'll talk a little

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,250
bit about custom entities in a moment

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,620
but this is where we start to get down

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,850
into some of that hopefully clearing up

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,480
some of the fuzziness around the

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,880
language so in an entity API we have

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,730
types of entities and those are those

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,470
big broad columns that we know nodes

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:33,770
users terms entities of the same type

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,710
all share the same properties so as you

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:41,570
can see every single node for example

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:46,190
has a node ID a revision ID the status

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:48,470
it's published or not user title etc and

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,540
so once you start to break that down

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,910
then those are the things that are going

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:56,780
to be common across all types of that

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,330
particular type of entity then we get

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:03,080
into bundles now for a long time

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,310
especially in seven when I was trying to

00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,830
start learning how to create my own

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,040
custom entities bundles kind of halfway

00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,420
made sense and kind of didn't make sense

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,050
but it's actually pretty simple bundles

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:18,589
are basically like subtypes so you've

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:20,630
got node is your entity type but then

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:23,000
when you have created a new content type

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,500
and that's another fun thing right we

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,530
talked about content types but really

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,680
they're node types those are actually

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:36,220
bundles so you've got bundles would be

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:38,690
articles pages events recipes reviews

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:42,260
whatever your content type is going to

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:44,060
be that's a bundle so you're kind of now

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,830
starting to take and you're getting down

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,519
into more and more detailed

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,649
voules of the structured data there are

00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:55,340
some entities that don't have bundles

00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:56,840
like for example the user entity you're

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,720
not going to have different types of

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,490
users you actually just have the one but

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,070
you can still attach fields to them and

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,350
when you define a custom entity many of

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,929
you want to brave that new world then

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,340
you can actually determine if you're

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:11,090
going to actually have bundles or not

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,679
available

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:17,929
etc so now we've gotten from the entity

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,909
type the con the properties that are

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,470
common across all of them down to

00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:23,720
different types of bundles which are

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,669
subtypes and this is where it starts to

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,519
get fun because now we can take the

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:31,399
field API and we can start to kind of

00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:33,830
add fields to each of those different

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:36,230
bundles and this is where that

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,059
structured data starts to get sort of

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:42,880
fragment and get a lot more useful for

00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:45,080
us now one thing to note and this may be

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,940
this may be interesting this may not be

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,059
interesting it may be useful at some

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,970
point it may not but up until we hit the

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:55,610
field level API we're really storing a

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:58,519
lot of information about this bundle in

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,889
the same place in the database so if you

00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:04,370
go to the node table in the database

00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:06,799
there's the node ID and the title and

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,750
the status and the user ID and the

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,870
created date in the post a date etc etc

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,940
setter and all of the nodes have that

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,370
information in there but as soon as you

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,919
add the body field or you add an image

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,769
field that's another table in the

00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,620
database so I don't want to get too deep

00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:26,299
into that but when you start thinking

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,649
about structured data and you start

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,470
thinking about the efficiency of your

00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:32,960
system this is where it starts to get

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,330
very interesting and fun because you can

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,909
make some decisions which can make your

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,529
life easier potentially or more

00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,330
difficult potentially you start talking

00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:44,899
about performance and scaling and all of

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,519
these wonderful things we'll touch on

00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:49,549
that a few more times but I just want to

00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:52,730
kind of bring that out and addy

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:54,020
validation API so this is actually

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,789
pretty cool

00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,639
this is where if you create an entity

00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:59,120
and you stick the wrong type of data in

00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:01,040
or

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,140
doesn't match your rules then the

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,540
validation API is going to figure that

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,450
out before it tries to save it this is

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,750
what makes sure that most all of the

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,730
time obviously there's always exceptions

00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,580
most all the time when you stick data

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,620
into the database using entities and you

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,730
pull it back out again it's going to be

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,559
what you expect and sometimes that may

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,650
not sound like that's that big a deal

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,160
but especially now that we're starting

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:33,740
to talk about api's and services and

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:37,070
getting data in and out of other systems

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:40,760
you have to know it's the same type has

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:42,950
anybody here done a using feeds or using

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,670
migration done a migrate or an import of

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,290
content data in and how many how many

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,880
people have done it exactly right the

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,120
first time without having to fix a bug

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,309
or there's an extra comma and you go

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,630
through and you're like 900 rows out of

00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:57,860
a thousand you think you got it then

00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,480
it's something throws up you have to

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,000
start all over again

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,710
entity validation won't necessarily stop

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,809
that but it's going to make sure that

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,120
the data we have going back out once it

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:11,660
has made it in it should be clean which

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,330
you can then rely on it so I'm not a

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,320
designer obviously I'm just gonna say

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,820
that I am a developer though and so I

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,550
break things down into boxes in my head

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,580
so this is what we were just looking at

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,840
but presented visually because I'm a

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,320
visual person I'm sure a lot of people

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,870
are too

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,730
so basically very quickly what we've

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,490
already seen we have the entity type in

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,080
this case we're talking about nodes we

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,870
have those properties and they're common

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,360
across all then we have those different

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,210
bundles as you can see they're lovely

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,550
little colors and then making use of the

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:50,600
field API we're adding fields to these

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:52,880
bundles now I will point out those dark

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,370
gray back and forth arrows that just

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,900
means that those are shared fields so

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:02,420
even though we have four different

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:05,179
bundles in this particular case and each

00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,690
one has multiple fields attached to it

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:11,000
we actually only have five fields that

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,500
we've added because body is the same

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,510
across all of them

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,840
tags is the same across three and hero

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:20,090
image is the same across two now there

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,690
are there are potential limitations to

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,760
sharing fields I won't go into that into

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,470
too much detail but this is where when

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,900
you start thinking about structured data

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,690
and data modeling it's important to

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,730
think about these things because if we

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,560
went through let's see that's nine ten

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,750
eleven that's eleven separate fields

00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,000
potentially so if we had if we were

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,770
creating a site and we had individual

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,100
fields that were not shared for each one

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,240
of these then now we've got eleven extra

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,160
fields that have to be stored in the

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,140
database and so now we have to have

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,970
tables for those fields we have to have

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,980
tables for the revisions of those fields

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,350
we potentially have to have tables and

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,000
they're related to anything else which

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,850
might add something on from contribs

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,940
base so that can you can see how if

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,790
you've got a large site with five ten

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,970
you know different content types alone

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:16,820
never mind all of your other entities

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,550
like terms and users etc then the number

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,880
of fields can just start to proliferate

00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,530
like crazy so if you get to a big site

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,780
and somebody comes in and then look so

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,330
why are there 400 tables in this

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,500
database this is absurd no this is now

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,350
we're starting to hit performance

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,970
problems then you go back and you see

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,610
well actually we could have had half

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,550
that number had we been a little smarter

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,620
about sharing fields so you shouldn't

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,570
always share fields but if there's a

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,830
good reason unless you have a good

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,950
reason not to you should strongly

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:54,380
consider it a good rule of thumb so an

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,810
entity is a loadable thingy that can

00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,930
optionally be filled a bowl it's all

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,360
making sense so far good seeing some

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:06,200
nodding heads smiles a few furrowed

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,120
brows that's okay we'll get there okay

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,940
so awesome so I know I know what an

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,590
entity is it's just a thingy right and I

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,900
can load it out of the database or stick

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,420
back in and hey if I'm feeling crazy I

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,670
can even stick fields on there and

00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,240
that's just really cool stuff well so

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,080
now you're going to sound like an expert

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,300
because people love it when you say

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,970
thingy actually

00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:33,860
but but then how do we use this stuff so

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,430
we've talked a little bit about what

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,050
entities are in core and I just wanted

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:43,130
to throw up a couple of examples we've

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:45,590
obviously talked about this entities are

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,800
for content so just straight up any

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,120
content that you have in your nodes

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,430
entities are for users obviously

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,490
collecting information about users and

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:59,230
their profiles custom blocks does

00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:04,520
anybody used custom blocks in Drupal 8

00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:09,800
nice few people so anybody in d7 ever

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:13,640
done use the beans module yeah feel

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,820
double panel panes okay yeah so

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,490
basically the idea here is that in Indy

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,980
7 you can go in and you can create a

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,270
custom block right and you can drop

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,780
whatever you want inside of it

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:29,960
HTML a widget for Twitter what have you

00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,460
well what about when you have you want

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,010
to create a bunch of blocks that all

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,270
have a similar data structure for

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,240
example you want to create a slideshow

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,120
block now you can go into views right

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,340
and you can create a view that uses a

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
slideshow display to do it and then

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,810
you're gonna have to have some mechanism

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,690
for choosing which images go in there

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,820
maybe it's a node queue maybe it's the

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,160
attacks on imme maybe you're just gonna

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,620
just kind of cheat and just put in the

00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,460
specific field IDs that you want you

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,290
know what what custom blocks and d8

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,020
allow us to do is go in and say I want a

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:08,660
slideshow block great now that's my

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,000
bundle now I want to add a field to it

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,100
and I want it to be an image reference

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,370
and I want to add as many of those as

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,380
possible and then on the theming layer

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,050
when when I have a template that's

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,360
applied I want to take that list of

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:28,180
images and I want to display them as a

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,470
slideshow once I've done that I or

00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,080
oftentimes more importantly than that

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,810
the actual user the content creator

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,800
who's not going to be touching views

00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,200
because they would they would probably

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,210
cry

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,580
they have the ability to go in and now

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,650
create slideshow blocks as many as they

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,110
want and all they have to do is add the

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,480
images if they want in there and when

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,790
they plop it on a page whether it's with

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,400
panels or they're just putting it in the

00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,900
regular block layout whether we get some

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,720
really cool stuff like Jesus talking

00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,060
about then it's it's simple it works it

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,890
does what they want to do and the really

00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,020
cool thing is because it's feel double

00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,640
when they come back and say hey you know

00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,320
what this slideshow thing is great I

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,210
just go put in my images and it does it

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,100
but man you know what I'm spending so

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,900
much time creating these images and

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,780
putting the text overlay and it's always

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,090
the same can you make my life easier no

00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,370
problem now I'm gonna go in and I'm

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:24,190
gonna actually add a text field for each

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,960
one so now you can you choose the image

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,970
you select the text field you want and

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,720
then it prints the slide with the text

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:33,490
overlaid you can add a button etc etc so

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,050
all of the things that we've done before

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:41,410
we can actually do now and sorry about

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:44,650
that guys computer is ringing at me and

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:47,230
we can do it a lot easier so again the

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,880
same type of content of a concept of

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:53,010
having structured content that you can

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,650
reuse in different ways we also have

00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:00,040
terms this is one area where I think a

00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:03,190
lot of people have not fully utilized

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,520
the power of taxonomy the ability to go

00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,200
in and not only just organize data

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,380
I mean having tags and categories is

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,540
great but being able to put in actual

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:17,050
information structured data tied to that

00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:19,950
term is really powerful so for example

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:23,680
let's say you have a recipe website and

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:27,130
you're adding ingredients and so this

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,530
soup has carrots well how cool would it

00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,900
be to when you click on carrots to not

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,640
only see a list of all of the recipes

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,760
that reference it which is pretty cool

00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,310
but also to be able to see a picture of

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,760
a carrot and in nutritional information

00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:44,500
and where they're grown may be tied to

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,080
an API that's telling you if they're on

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,720
sale or not at the was it gourmet market

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,280
I think is what he said right so there's

00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,120
this is where we start to get into this

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,580
idea of very

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,560
rich data and again we're talking about

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,230
the same thing we're just talking about

00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,760
using entities but we're creating

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,590
different types of data structures that

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,690
have different rules and different ways

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,730
of tying together and we're able to do

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,430
to create some really really complicated

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:11,680
really rich systems using these same

00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,840
tools over and over again same thing

00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,060
with comments same thing with files I

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,710
cannot tell you how many times I've been

00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,740
in meetings talking to marketing people

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:23,230
and once they get the concept that they

00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,230
can not only upload an image but they

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,510
can add information about it like where

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,930
it came from or what the usage rights

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:34,090
are or when those usage rights expire so

00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,070
they can then use rules to go in and say

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,570
hey if the usage rights have expired for

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,610
this image don't display it show the

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,810
default instead you know that's the kind

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,210
of stuff they have to go through and do

00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,760
by hand now and once people start to get

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,740
the power of that it blows their mind

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,860
and so we actually have the ability

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,840
using Drupal as this tool set to not

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,060
only deal with the situations we have

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,830
currently but we also have the ability

00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,120
to go in and know that we're gonna be

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,090
able to deal with things later on down

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,300
the road so I tell people all the time

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,700
there's no way to be future proof

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,050
because a year ago I mean unless you're

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,300
an engineer at Amazon who would have

00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:14,530
known that the echo is coming out right

00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:17,830
but you can be future ready so the the

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,680
module that does the initial integration

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:24,850
for the Amazon echo one of the guys on

00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,290
my team did it in a weekend and the

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,090
original version was pretty rough let me

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,160
tell you but it was a kind of thing

00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,810
where because we had these common api's

00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,880
and the common ways of doing things and

00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,590
all this stuff in core it wasn't a huge

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,300
lift and this is not somebody that just

00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:40,180
has nothing better to do at this time

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,700
but code he's a manager of a team he

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,220
works like 50 60 hours a week he's

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,280
married he just had a baby I mean he

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,050
often I'll be on a video conference and

00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,940
he's got the baby in a sling right here

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,680
because it won't sleep otherwise and so

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,050
this is somebody who does not have a lot

00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,700
of hours in the day but because he knows

00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,950
how to leverage these tools in such a

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,800
great way he was able to very quickly do

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,650
some cool things so let's take a quick

00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,050
example at this now I actually build

00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,180
this for myself in d6 way back in the

00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:13,180
day project management system when I

00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,500
kind of had my own little dev shop but

00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,190
let's take a look at what this might

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,930
look like so if you wanted to build one

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:22,030
you wouldn't actually go you could go

00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,470
there our project management modules and

00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,050
Suites and things you can pull in but

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,430
you can also just grab Drupal core and a

00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,910
couple of modules and roll your own

00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:32,560
so for content types different bundles

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,440
you might have would be a customer or

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,850
business profile an actual project which

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,470
would contain information about an

00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,810
individual project you were working on

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,580
and then specific tickets that came up

00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,910
underneath that describing what that's

00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,280
about

00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,140
and those might have images or files

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,880
attached or you might want to do

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,800
something fancy with like dates and

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,990
times and Gantt charts and completions

00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,150
all of that's totally possible the

00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,850
question of time and how important those

00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,160
things are users obviously for people to

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,350
log in so both customers to see what's

00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,590
going on on their projects for them to

00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,840
add you know notes on problems they have

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,310
for them to start tickets for developers

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,990
to update the system and see what's

00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:16,210
going on custom blocks and custom views

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:19,330
reusable page components so I'm on this

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:22,450
project page I want to see on the side a

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:25,300
burn down chart of you know over time

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,340
what is the estimated total number of

00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,260
hours what is the recorded total number

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,270
of hours how are those matching up you

00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,130
know what's the as a user you know as a

00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,630
customer I want to log in and see how

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,160
many hours are being tracked against

00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,620
this project how much is this costing me

00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,090
right now this very second it's very

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,830
easy you create those things you put

00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,940
them up and then the system takes care

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,770
of the rest

00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,620
structured content like we talked about

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:50,230
slideshows and hero banners I'm using

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,640
panels to do layouts and dashboards and

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,060
all those kinds of fun things we're

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,950
using the content in different ways

00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:00,520
vocabulary in terms you see this all the

00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:02,100
time on dido so we're talking about

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,510
issues there it's very similar

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,160
categories for projects how do you

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,230
organize tickets if it's an if you're

00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,970
building it now if it's stuck on

00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,880
something if you're not going to work on

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,010
it if it's in the backlog comments some

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,130
very cool things you can do so for

00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,299
example on a customer profile our

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,730
business profile put

00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:24,039
notes about what you've talked about or

00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,080
things to watch out for

00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,789
you know don't ever talk about Game of

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,970
Thrones with this guy because he's

00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:32,590
always two weeks behind and he will fire

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:36,279
us if we if we give him any spoilers

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:38,619
right adding comments and time tracking

00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:41,739
to tickets so you have a ticket that

00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:43,629
says Oh create a new slide show custom

00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:45,070
block and the theming and formatting so

00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:47,950
that they can create slideshows on their

00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:51,369
Drupal site great well now when I go as

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,460
a developer and I'm adding a comment how

00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:58,929
great for me to actually have in their

00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:00,759
fields for the what type of work I did I

00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,889
did theming work maybe there's a

00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,649
different rate for that or how much time

00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:06,609
I spent I spent two hours doing this

00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:08,470
maybe there isn't it some attached

00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:10,839
fields or images here's a mock-up of

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:13,720
what its gonna look like my notes on

00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:17,260
what it is and over time if that my

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,359
needs change I can just adapt add fields

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,609
take them away change them all of this

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,470
stuff is pretty flexible and then of

00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:26,319
course storing and managing project

00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:28,690
files because since files are a separate

00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:30,669
entity even though you can attach them

00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,790
into comments or attach them to projects

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:36,040
or attach them to tickets you can also

00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,139
have a view which just shows you all of

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,790
the files associated with this customer

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,440
all the files associated with this

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,869
project all the files associated this

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,589
ticket all of those wonderful things and

00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:49,270
all of this you can do without really

00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:53,309
touching a whole lot of code if any at

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,309
all depends on how crazy you want to get

00:34:53,970 --> 00:35:00,069
so let's say we go down that path and

00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,869
when you do as much as we can with the

00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:04,690
entities that we have available in core

00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:08,230
and either we start to hit some limits

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:11,589
or maybe we are doing some things that

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,690
it just isn't quite a good fit maybe

00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:16,299
we're thoroughly obsessed with

00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:17,710
performance and we have this data and we

00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:20,260
want to make sure that all of that data

00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,450
is in a single row in a table we don't

00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,640
want it split across you know twelve

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,400
different tables and have to do sorts

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,849
and views and things so we might need to

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,109
do a custom entity so that the downside

00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,980
is it will tell you now if you're going

00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,900
to do a custom end

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,850
at this point you're gonna have to write

00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:41,190
some code the upside is that between

00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:46,150
some example modules that are out there

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:47,680
between things like Drupal Console I

00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,590
don't know if they allow you to do

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,700
entities yet but I think it's on the map

00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,920
there are tools that make that easier

00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,869
and then of course even when you're

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,960
creating your own custom entities you

00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:01,810
can still rely on the same user

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,210
interface for doing everything else so

00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:06,760
you can actually get a whole lot of help

00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,020
you're 80 90% of the way there on a

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,080
custom entity whether you realize it or

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,990
not right now so why would you need a

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,090
custom entity you might need something

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,910
that's very very specific in terms of

00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,290
the type of entity that you need

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,640
maybe those remember those properties

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,810
that are shared across all of them

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,369
maybe there are some high-level

00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,550
properties that need to be shared across

00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:29,800
all of those entity subtypes that you

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,619
really need access to that for whatever

00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,600
reason maybe you've got some additional

00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:37,750
methods that you want to add not just

00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,010
you know save or delete or update maybe

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,220
you've got some things like for example

00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:45,160
in our project management maybe when we

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,369
add that comment we want to actually

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,810
extend it so it actually recalculates

00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:54,400
hours and cost and charts and things

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:57,460
maybe up specific data or workflow needs

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,530
and instead of trying to create that

00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,720
stuff with the entities that we have

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,450
available it actually makes a lot more

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,420
sense to kind of extend and create our

00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:10,690
own you might not want to use something

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:13,600
that's existing so for example as we say

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:16,420
here if you have a time report entity

00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,100
that's very similar to comment but you

00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,630
don't want other modules that you have

00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,060
in the site that interact with comments

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:24,100
to affect it well now you can get a

00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,830
clear separation and you can just kind

00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,900
of create your own if you need total

00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,190
control if you want to extend your data

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,980
model in ways that don't necessarily

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,940
make sense or that are different

00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,220
basically at the end of the day any time

00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,710
it makes sense for you to have a custom

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,020
module then you can do that and again

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,300
the beautiful thing is all of that is

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,500
possible with the entity API without

00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,780
having to do a whole bunch of crazy

00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,580
stuff

00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:53,150
sohere's has anybody heard of external

00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:58,700
entities I think in seven there's a

00:37:53,150 --> 00:38:00,770
module for remote entities so I've not

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,170
had a chance to play with these very

00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,510
much I tried with remote entities for

00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,540
project and it was a demo as doing is

00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,710
very quick the idea here and I think

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,440
we're gonna start to see a lot more of

00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:15,500
this is that you create an entity

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,200
structure within Drupal that gives you a

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,460
way to interact with it so views can man

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,470
it can interact with it

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,810
services can interact with it the

00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:28,220
caching system all of those things

00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:30,349
however that that data isn't in your

00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,140
database it's in some external service

00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:35,030
an API or another database or

00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,650
what-have-you and so there's this

00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:41,780
abstraction so Drupal has an entity and

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,460
as as far as Drupal is concerned this is

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,990
all in the family it's like great I know

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,060
entities I know how they work the

00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,580
difference is that when you're looking

00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,839
for that specific entity that recipe

00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:54,740
that maybe is coming from an API

00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:56,750
somewhere that is actually either coming

00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:59,930
from cache because we've already grabbed

00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:02,210
it we have it here or it's actually

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,030
calling out to that API instead of the

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,330
database grabbing the data and returning

00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,760
it

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,140
hopefully caching it and then doing

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,440
whatever it's gonna do stick in the view

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,750
or what have you so again I think we're

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,050
gonna start to see a bit more of this as

00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:19,339
the space matures and this is actually

00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,800
very exciting we start talking about

00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:24,830
integrating with external api's and

00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,570
sources without having to decide well

00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:30,050
I'm going to migrate or import the

00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,700
content well now I've got 10,000 recipes

00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,470
in my database and I haven't even

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,609
started adding content yet now I've

00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,160
already got to upgrade my database

00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:39,349
server or I've got something very

00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,940
specific it changes a lot I need to be

00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:42,710
able to hit it quickly well now I've got

00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,210
to write some type of custom integration

00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,099
that knows how to do stuff but then

00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,609
maybe I don't know how to use views with

00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:51,260
that this is I think gonna save a lot of

00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:54,410
people a lot of headaches so something

00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:58,160
to keep in mind okay so I've been

00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:00,110
talking a lot I don't think we have too

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,500
many people asleep yet so that's good

00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:06,740
but there is a very cool module it's fun

00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:10,340
to play with called er d entity

00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:12,320
relationship diagram buddy of mine wrote

00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,090
it and this actually allows you to go in

00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,890
and start to take a look at the entities

00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:20,660
in your system and it starts to graph

00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:23,510
them out so this is this is actually in

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,520
the output from that so this is not one

00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:28,480
of my bad diagrams is one of Drupal's

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,570
bad diagrams it's actually a lot better

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,820
so what you can see is we we have this

00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,170
these are content entities and we're

00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,360
looking at two different types we're

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,090
looking at a landing page bundle and a

00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,370
basic page and we can see all of the

00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:45,020
different fields that are associated now

00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:48,590
some of those are properties because

00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:53,060
they are the same across all of the

00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:56,210
bundles node ID UUID etc and then some

00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:00,530
of those are specific so you'll see that

00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:02,510
we've got moderation state body etc and

00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,620
then of course we're also seeing that

00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:08,720
we've got references

00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:12,590
so we're referencing the user entity

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,990
type from both who it's authored by as

00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:18,110
well as the revision user ID on both

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:20,080
objects and we're referencing moderation

00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,210
state which is another type of entity

00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:26,930
based on the work flow moderation that's

00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:29,870
in place take another look at another

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:33,050
example here here's another example

00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:38,620
that's actually an article but also now

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:41,180
referencing the tags which is a term and

00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,400
how all those pieces fit together tags

00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:46,850
are related to vocabularies and terms

00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,370
are related back and forth this can

00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:52,670
actually get pretty weird pretty crazy

00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:55,580
pretty complex but something fun to play

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:57,470
with and also a really good tool to have

00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,930
in your toolbox when you're either

00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,300
talking about data modeling and you just

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:04,250
you just spent like 30 or 40 minutes

00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,930
quickly going in adding a few content

00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,280
types from taxonomy terms from fields

00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,170
and then you're going to go show it to

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,490
somebody who's a decision maker and say

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,740
well this is how the data is structured

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,790
does it make sense do you see something

00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,410
wrong with it or something

00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,180
we should do and then you show up with

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,440
something like this or like whoa I just

00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,450
talked to you an hour ago and you've

00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:25,250
already done this like yes I am that

00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:27,020
amazing and by the way I deserve a raise

00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:31,940
making good use of those tools that we

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:37,250
have so something good to know about all

00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:42,550
righty so what is an entity anybody know

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:47,800
oh look at that we're getting there

00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:50,930
okay so all together and entity is a

00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,940
loadable thingy that can optionally be

00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,170
filled a bowl does anybody think they're

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,900
gonna remember at least part of that

00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:59,150
after today it's the thingy part right

00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,470
that's what got me like when I read that

00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,900
it was just like a light went off I was

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,330
like that's fantastic

00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,910
okay so there there is a there's a

00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:09,500
feedback form for all of the sessions

00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,780
and they're encouraging everybody to

00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,940
give feedback so that at the next con

00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,590
they've got a better idea on what things

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,410
people like what they don't like

00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:20,000
etc so I don't know what that link is

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,030
but please if you have the app or you're

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,480
on the site feel free to do that and

00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,480
thank you guys very much

00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:42,930
question oh sure

00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:47,100
any other questions I believe they're

00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:49,080
gonna be on the I'll update the the page

00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,850
for this on the the DrupalCon

00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:56,910
site and I'll put the link to the slides

00:43:50,850 --> 00:44:01,860
there yeah yeah the question uck I've

00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:06,810
not played with D CK good stuff okay

00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:08,310
well try it out let me know entity

00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:11,090
construction kit I've heard of it but I
