Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Approaches for UX changes big and small
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Drupal is very powerful but how much of that power is real if people can not understand or even find it?

It has historically been very hard to make big changes in how Drupal functionality gets exposed to people. At the same time, turning Drupal outside-in is a big focus for Drupal 8 and 9. We want to get better at making Drupal work like people expect things to work.

Lets talk about what it means to design and build better Drupal UX:

What to work on: how to prioritise and/or sequence efforts so we can unite forces
How to structure the work: processes for design & build phases
What we can do now: where & how to start
What still needs figuring out: what are the blockers, how to remove those.
