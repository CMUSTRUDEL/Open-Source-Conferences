and outs of your sponsorship and ins and

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,420
out of the drupal con in general so it's

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,130
going to be pretty basic information but

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,390
it's all stuff that people need to know

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,399
and I get asked many times so I hope

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,020
this is a good resource for you but

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,440
first off I just want to start off by

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,390
thanking you guys us sponsors are the

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,210
people that are funding this event and

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,000
helping us as drupal association bring

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,219
the community together to push the

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,739
project forwards and connect the people

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,530

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,719
together so again without you this

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,110
wouldn't be possible we're so

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,460
appreciative of it and I don't know if I

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,220
speak for the entire community but

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,830
everyone else is appreciative what you

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,860
guys have done for us so it's my job to

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,170
make sure that your time as a sponsor is

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,549
as enjoyable and a seamless as possible

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:27,060
so just to start off a few housekeeping

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,340
