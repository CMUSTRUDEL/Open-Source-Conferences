Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Drupal and Logstash: centralised logging
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Have you heard about Logstash and always wanted to test it out? This is your perfect chance to start!

The ELK stack – Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana – is a popular combination for aggregating, filtering and visualising data from multiple log streams. This presentation will demonstrate how to use ELK with Drupal. You will see data being filtered on the fly with lots of pretty graphs.

The focus of this presentation will be on how easy it is to start. We will cover how to run the ELK stack on your development machine with just a few commands - using the power of docker - and analyse your apache, Drupal and php logs.

Then we will have a look at real production installation, recieving logs from different sources, where we will analyse a problem and visualise trends.

The objective of this session is to:

get you excited about Logstash, understand what it is,
get you motivated enough to start using it, even to set it up yourself,
teach you how to create graphs on the fly, visualise your data,
realise the power of a centralised logging solution.
