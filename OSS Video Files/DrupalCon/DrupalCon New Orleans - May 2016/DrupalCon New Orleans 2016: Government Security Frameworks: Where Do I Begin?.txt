Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Government Security Frameworks: Where Do I Begin?
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	1) Government Security Frameworks: Where Do I Begin?

SPEAKERS: JASON FORD

Experience Level: Beginner 

Development companies are becoming more involved in application building for the federal government, but are quickly finding themselves in a security nightmare.

The acronyms “FedRAMP” and “FISMA” are commonly interjected into every conference call you are on, causing you ask yourself, “How did I get here?” Well, you are not alone … Weaving your way through federal security frameworks for the first time can be extremely difficult and very frustrating.

In this session, we will discuss these complicated frameworks, and devise different ways to leverage compliant services for your application. We will also review various tools and techniques to apply against your application to meet these framework standards.

If you have asked any of the following questions, this session is for you:

How do compliance frameworks apply to my application?
What happens once my application is certified?
How can I reuse previous work to achieve compliance for other agencies?
This session provides you the basic knowledge of application compliance you will need to successfully navigate the world of government security.

2) Avoid Traffic Jams: The Impact of eCommerce Site Performance on Bottom-Line Results

SPEAKERS: DOUG GOLDBERG

Experience Level: Intermediate

Imagine a time when marketing is on its game, the flash sale is ready, 25,000 units have been acquired and 45,000 independent consultants are vying to get a massive reduction on price of a single item. With improper infrastructure and engineering this is a nightmare waiting to happen.  As a matter of fact, prior to coming to Platform.sh this nightmare turned into one companies reality.  Anger, frustration and stress for everyone involved month after month during every flash sale.  Once they moved to a custom engineered site at Platform.sh the nightmare magically disappeared:

“Today’s splurge was downright magical.  Thank you so much for working so hard to lessen the stress and make it so much easier" - independent consultant

Magic might not be the best word for what was really custom engineering to create a truly scalable infrastructure and understanding where the bottlenecks actually lie for an individual client.  Product lines are important but understanding when it’s time to create a bespoke offering taking into account the client’s specific needs are just as important.

In this talk - we’ll cover the building blocks and discuss:

How a 1 second delay in performance can reduce conversion by 7%

Relationship between load time and bounce rate

The importance of partnering with your client not just providing a service

How to load test and determine breaking points of code and infrastructure

How to scale every component of the stack

What the git-driven, PaaS Platform.sh will do to increase efficiency and scalability of your eCommerce application.

Learn about the need for speed and stability for eCommerce sites and the infrastructure that hosts and supports them in this case study session.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,259
alright um my name's Jason forward CTO

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,330
black mesh been doing this for well

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,269
security firm us all my life for the

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,070
most part but some of the challenges

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,350
that we see and kind of things we've

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,390
gone through with our customer base try

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,500
want to give it here I'm not gonna be

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,029
talking about our customer base and when

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,990
we're talking about really what we do /

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,890
say I'm going to talk more about

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,300
frameworks which if if I say the word

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,279
security you get excited you're going to

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,260
love this if you go oh my goddess

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,000
security I don't to deal with that I'm

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,600
probably bore you for 30 minutes but you

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,910
can bear with it so some background for

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,180
for myself like I said makinde own

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,530
security since 97 i started in in fed

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,800
sip space and the FBI headquarters

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,789
building and then kind of went around

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,539
the civilian sector for a while us as an

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,620
entity were PCI DSS certified for level

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,210
1 we have fisma moderate we have FedRAMP

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,850
moderate as a platform and in his

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,909
infrastructure we were founded i'm one

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,770
of the founders in 2003 and we have

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,320
basically slide customers everything

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,880
commercial side as well from that side

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,490
so that would be the last black mesh

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,530
thing you see up here besides the logo

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,229
in the corner that's gonna be hit

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:23,479
alright so security versus compliance I

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:25,560
mean a lot of you probably out there are

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,780
kind of familiar with this concept maybe

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,780
you aren't but you know security is how

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,600
you actually do those those things how

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,740
you actually implement those controls

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,590
compliance is a snapshot of how you vent

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,930
those controls so from that snapshot you

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,240
know it really doesn't give you a a

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,009
holistic picture of what's going on it's

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,890
just how that looked at that point in

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,540
time when you looked at it right so you

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,549
know but security is that framework that

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,409
you actually see everything that is

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,409
associated with you to that system or

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,360
that that plan some pretty notable

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,790
things in government for at least this

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,759
space anyway you know White House runs a

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,640
version of Drupal you know we actually

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,580
host the Department of Energy their main

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,870
website the part of EDD obviously

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,650
recovery.org crowd or drag of recovery

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,970
gov

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,670
security runs that there's a lot of them

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,900
so point is is it it is a secure

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,150
platform and that's one of those things

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,739
that a lot of people seem to have to

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,140
fight a lot of expression in the

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,390
government summit yesterday we talked a

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,939
lot about that how to present ripples

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,180
being secure and that's that's really

00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,470
the that's the hardest part right and if

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,939
you can get over the Linux part and you

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,980
can say what linux is secure you're

00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,329
doing that with sticks and in a disk

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,269
space you're doing that with other

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,709
things as well why shouldn't it be other

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:48,030
open source technologies like drupal

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:50,819
like other CMS is to be accepted in that

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,750
same framework so frameworks really the

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,319
end of the day there's a ton of them

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,260
right so but here's the main ones pci

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,439
for credit card phys Mo's in 2002

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,459
federal the basically federal government

00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,139
decided that they wanted to actually

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,780
have some kind of compliance around that

00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:10,319
so i created that off of NIST 853

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,579
framework nest is the if you're not

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,620
familiar with them they're the entity

00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,560
that advises the government and others

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,699
on how to secure their not only their IT

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,269
infrastructure but all their

00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:23,250
infrastructure financial everything else

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,599
ISO standards are more global you know

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,209
HIPAA is obviously health healthcare

00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,699
FedRAMP virtual version of FISMA at the

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,500
end of the day and then DISA has its own

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:36,560
thing as well and it in a DoD space you

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,699
know really comes down to just this

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,650
compliance in general comes down to just

00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,090
these six steps I know it's it's it's

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,459
hard to boil down compliance into

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,889
anything but at the end of the day it's

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,329
really just these things so going

00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,709
through figuring out what you have to

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,359
actually monitor on what you have to

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,470
report on you know how do you assess

00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,819
those controls how do you actually

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,319
implement them and then you monitor

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,220
those things after you implement them at

00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,349
the end of the day it's as simple as

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,090
that how you actually have to do that

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,470
process it's not so simple right and

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,959
that's what we usually run into a net

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,849
sub problems right so kind of going into

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,139
a couple these compliance frameworks in

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,729
a little more detail i'm going to focus

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,970
more on FISMA the FedRAMP more than

00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:17,280
anything else just because those seem to

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,829
be kind of the the harder ones to do pc

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,630
is also difficult to do as well hip is

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,659
kind of a joke compared to the other

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,120
ones honestly but from a framework

00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:30,240
perspective you know like i said FISMA

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,080
ESMA came out in 2002 it was based on as

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,910
853 framework from NIST at that point in

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,220
time all systems actually had to get an

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,510
authority to operate an ATO based upon

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,290
how the system looked at that point in

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:47,010
time of implementation so conocimos

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,900
requirements you have to have a system

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,010
inventory you have to basically say what

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,720
your network diagram looks like what's

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,699
the system look like you basically get

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,410
all these things in place and then

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,750
figure out what your risk factors are

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,979
from that and then try to figure out all

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,440
right if these are my wrists as

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,760
acceptable risks or not and it doesn't

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,680
matter if this is on the software side

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,539
or if this is on the hardware side or

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,789
any of those sides it's all of it

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:11,250
including yourself as a human and in the

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:12,539
system right you're part of this whether

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,479
you can be spearfish attacked for

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,380
instance and compromise the system and

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,820
then you go through a certification

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,400
process and you go into continuous

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,620
monitoring I'm kind of flying through

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,240
this pretty quickly but I could I mean

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,660
we spent literally eight hours yesterday

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,610
talking about security compliance and we

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,349
didn't scratch scratch the surface 30

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,610
minutes here is hardly justice for it

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:36,690
but just when I kind of give a

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,520
high-level overview within those those

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,010
that framework there's different

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,229
categorizations so you can have low

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,270
moderate or high and it depends upon

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,970
what that system needs to have so if you

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,099
have a high system for instance as I

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,190
always use the example if you're in the

00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,870
space of energy for instance and you

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,340
have nuclear war codes then that's

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,570
obviously got me high right and there's

00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,160
going to be a lot more controls wrapped

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,870
around that whereas a low is going to be

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,220
similar like a public-facing web site

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,930
that you may not even collect data on

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,930
right it might be just bear shirt like a

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,880
pretty short site or something like that

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,650
it is based upon you know phipps

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,300
compliance if you've done any federal

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,770
compliance work at all or anything in

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,320
the security world you know phipps

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,760
already today it is the way that the

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,470
encryption happens and how those things

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,169
are encrypted weather that day is at

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,080
rest or whether that is in transit and

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:27,000
how you are interacting with that with

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,919
with that system to actually see that

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,660
data whether it's in a clear or not just

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,310
cut more like security controls things

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,129
of that nature so how we categorize

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,749
these things

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,699
all those things get categorized into

00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:42,379
into an SSP or system security plan

00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,330
those those things there are things that

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,009
you have to write as a system owner so

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,199
you as a developer you have to write an

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,610
SSP whether you know it or not you may

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,769
be answering questions for your security

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,179
person which then they were taking those

00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:54,679
answers and then writing that plan out

00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,669
really it's just saying how your system

00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:57,110
works so if you're saying you use

00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:59,389
two-factor authentication for single

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,709
sign-on you have to say that you do that

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,239
and how do you do that right do you have

00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:05,089
ldap behind that do you have something

00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:07,309
else are using captcha you know for your

00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:09,830
forms all that stuff matters right you

00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:11,240
have to document those things once you

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,119
have all that documented then it goes

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,099
into those control families which I

00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:18,379
think I talked about the next slide but

00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:20,860
basically we have the there's a really

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:23,179
well-known format template for afisma

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,669
but it's pretty lenient from the

00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:27,769
perspective of how you write those

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:31,819
things it's really just a word doc with

00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:32,719
these control families inside of it then

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,889
you can go through the risk assessment

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,149
like I said trying to figure out

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,559
vulnerabilities threats no different

00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:39,050
than what you do for Drupal updates or

00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:41,360
any other CMS and trying to figure out

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,860
what what actually is going to impact

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,199
this site and how someone's going to

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,079
actually attack it and then from that

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,219
either do compensating controls to base

00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,469
like deal with those attacks and

00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,879
mitigate that risk or you figure out way

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:56,240
too right to control or put a better

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,740
system in place to deal with it lastly

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,019
is the independence Essman this is the

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,309
most painful part you have an auditor

00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,659
sit with you for long periods of time

00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:04,099
and then they ask you to take

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,389
screenshots of things and give them

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,860
screenshots so you can see all this

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,509
stuff happening so you can actually

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,860
verify that you say that if you change

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:11,779
you have password complexity turned on

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,550
in your application show me right

00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:17,629
screenshot that and that's going to be

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,099
part of the compliance piece of it so

00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:20,839
once you have the certification the

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,699
certification comes out of all of that

00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:27,619
stuff that assessment and all that stuff

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:29,300
goes to usually it's the the head of

00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:31,309
security for that agency typically in

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,339
fisma space because the agency typically

00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,719
deals with that and then once they have

00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,969
that and they look over things and if

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,279
the risk is acceptable to them

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,110
acceptable to them then they will give

00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,810
you an authority to operate on ATO from

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,860
that piece and that's the authorization

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,630
piece

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,950
so fisma requirements from the

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,750
perspective of you know continuous

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,430
monitoring is the last bit of this as we

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,070
saw from the first piece before we move

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,480
on to something other than FISMA

00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,920
continues firing is just ongoing what

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,990
you're looking at so do you do

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,680
penetration testing do you do credential

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,360
scans do you do do you actually update

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,650
your antivirus do you actually see if

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,730
you have intrusion detection on your

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,070
stuff do you actually update those

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,960
policies things of that nature do you

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,730
actually rotate your passwords is their

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,770
logs for that all these things going

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,850
that continuous mari bucket auditors

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,590
when are they come in and look at you

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,290
they will ask you for all this data

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,610
that's part of the evidence right so

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,140
that's the important bit to actually get

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,780
that recertification piece at the bottom

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,580
if you don't if you don't do all that

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,230
stuff then they flag you and either you

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,440
have a very short amount of time to

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,320
remediate that or you lose your ato is

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,530
what it comes down to so that was all

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,760
fisma side FedRAMP is you know fisma is

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,140
really for it's a one-time authority to

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,610
operate for that system how it was

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,020
deployed if you make any major changes

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,030
to that then you have to change the

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:56,260
whole thing and redo it again FedRAMP

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:58,810
was otto with an ATO once and then you

00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,000
can operate it multiple times so and

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,620
it's also virtual versus physical so

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,960
FISMA is like physical servers bare

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,790
metal servers FedRAMP is all virtualized

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,130
so that we could docker containers cloud

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,930
stuff things of that nature same kind of

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,220
concepts but at the end of the day what

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,450
they've done is they've changed some of

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:19,510
the control sets to deal with

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,420
virtualization and multi-tenancy so

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,830
FedRAMP is FISMA is done at the agency

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,960
level so whatever agency you're dealing

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:29,440
with FedRAMP is done at the GSA level so

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,320
GSA owns that program the PMO office is

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,660
run by Matt Goodrich currently he and

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,490
his staff basically deal with all these

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,960
incoming you know packages from all

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,940
these different cloud service providers

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,880
and I'll get into some of that here in a

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,440
minute so anybody who's doing virtual

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,270
servers is for the government you have

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,770
to go through this process so that

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,060
includes infrastructure as a service

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,440
platform of the service or software as a

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,820
service so if you come up with a turbo

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,040
platform and say you want to offer

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,570
multi-site multi-tenancy from multiple

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,490
agencies inside of something you'd have

00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,690
to be a SAS provider and you have to

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,459
find either someone who is an

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,730
infrastructure or a platform service

00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,380
provide

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,680
in order to help you with that where you

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,120
do it all yourself either way it was

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,220
basically gear dad having a standardized

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,079
approach for for offering virtual

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,810
services which didn't exist until this

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,670
program happened four years ago and like

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:21,070
I said their software platform

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:22,480
infrastructure-as-a-service so the whole

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,980
idea and concept of this was that you

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,070
can use it by multiple agencies so for

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,810
instance for us you know if we got we

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,730
got FedRAMP certified another agency

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,630
could actually use our ATO and not have

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,699
to go through that whole process again

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,310
unlike with isma right FISMA is

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:38,949
laborious it's tedious it's all those

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,800
things so having having that ability to

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:43,420
leverage that ATO off of another agency

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,500
means that you get to inherit a bunch of

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,300
things that you don't actually have to

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,649
go through again and want to cry

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,920
yourself to sleep at night as you're

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,050
trying to deal with this 22 methods

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,930
there's the joining accreditation board

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,420
or the jab and then there's a agency

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,339
sponsorship agency sponsorship is the

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,290
fast path to this because the agency

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,820
that in question that gives you the ato

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,579
is actually responsible for doing the

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,750
continuous monitoring efforts with you

00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,380
whereas the jab is done by volunteers

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,790
inside the GSA so there's three

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,800
high-level security officers from

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,899
different agencies that volunteer their

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,000
time to the GSA how many government

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,440
agencies do you know the pair officials

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,779
want to actually volunteer time to read

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,720
12-under page documents you know it's a

00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:28,630
long process and it's awful I mean it's

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,360
bad there's about 100 CSPs right now in

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,709
the job queue average time to get

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,560
through that is about two to four years

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,240
depending upon how fast you move and

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,790
then agency sponsorship can be much much

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,769
less same kind of things so we talked

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,680
about before on the FISMA side and

00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,600
requirements again hardware software

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,279
network diagram data flow data flow is

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,750
new right so how does your data flow

00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,250
through your application where does it

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,930
see things encrypted where is it arrest

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,519
things of that nature is all important

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,990
here and then on top of that if you have

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,440
to have a trusted internet connection or

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:01,329
a tick the to talk from your agency to

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,100
your system that all goes in that data

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:09,130
flow section as well again same thing

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,160
Fifth's 199 based it's actually dash to

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,899
know

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,420
so how those things are encrypted how

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,279
those things get pushed around right now

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,290
there's only load moderate and FedRAMP

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,389
there are no heís GSA doesn't know how

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,610
to deal with it not only that no one

00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,970
wants to put high data in in cloud

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,589
service providers these days there's an

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,910
equivalent cloud in disis base which

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:31,339
I'll get to in a minute it's dis as

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,949
actual cloud is is actually high but it

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:38,600
is inside the DoD and only DoD people

00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:41,089
can use it so again security controls in

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,160
853 framework FISMA and FedRAMP look a

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,329
lot of like the controls are written in

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,430
different words but it mean the same

00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:47,959
thing you know access control is still

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,399
access control password complexity still

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,899
password complexity how you doin certain

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,670
spots still how you do in certain squats

00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,589
it's the same thing so if you do one

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,170
it's pretty easy to transition or the

00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,500
other not not super easy but easy enough

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,389
right low systems typically have about a

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,800
hundred twenty controls and controls are

00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,389
broken up into those control families I

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,399
talked about before and it shows in a

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,860
minute mayra system is roughly about

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,269
three hundred and that that's before an

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,110
agency can actually add more stuff to

00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,339
you so you can actually get more stuff

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,540
same kind of thing with FISMA you know

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,449
system security plan you got to write

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,759
that the just the template is 350 pages

00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,810
before you put any words to it once you

00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,290
start writing paragraphs and paragraphs

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,730
for each control you know it can go for

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,639
a thousand pages hars is currently about

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:35,959
1200 so as time goes forward you keep

00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,459
adding to it so you have that these

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,720
support to the supporting documentation

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,959
it's just not answering the controls is

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,639
enough you have to do things like have a

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:46,310
user guide on how to use your system

00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,620
right how to how do you do privacy

00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,319
control how do you do encryption at rest

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,910
how do you do rules of behavior how do

00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:54,800
you do security training all those

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,899
things are attachments on top of that so

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,899
you're starting to see it's it's a long

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:02,180
complex system of stuff to deal with

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,860
right that's why it takes so long to get

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,910
through it because usually the first

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,279
time you go through you don't get it

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,009
right you have to go back and modify and

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,569
edit those things risk assessment again

00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,160
very similar to in you're seeing a lot

00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:16,189
of commonalities between FISMA and

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,959
FedRAMP figure out those threats as

00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:20,480
vulnerabilities again do the through the

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,759
risk analysis here's the different part

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,870
so the assessments not done by the

00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,520
agency it's done

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,520
by Threepio or a third-party auditing

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,860
agency or organization those are all

00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,510
certified by the GSA so there are

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,580
actually commercial companies that go

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,440
and get certified there's about 30 of

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,029
them today but here's the difference is

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,650
that not all of them will do

00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,240
accreditation some of them will help you

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,760
write your documentation right so they

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,930
focus on the the up front how do you get

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,040
your rules of behavior done how do you

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,960
get all your documents in place how do

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,580
you actually get a successful package to

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,380
go through the first time because it's

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,380
costly and it's it's difficult to do so

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,120
again certification authorization again

00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,890
very very similar to FISMA either you

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,040
get the authorization granted by the jab

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,570
or by the sponsoring agency you have if

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,040
you get it from the jab you get a PA or

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,110
provisional authorization if you get a

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,310
hit from the agency you get in atl which

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,570
is an authority to operate Theus

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,660
monitoring again it's kind of the same

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,570
things here we have to do these things

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,990
more often I wish to wish to say because

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,339
it's really a lot but at the end of day

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,230
what we're what I'm trying to show here

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,910
is that you're always going through this

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,190
agile environment of trying to figure

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,779
out security so all these things that

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,390
you guys are doing to develop code it's

00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:39,589
the same same process for security which

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:41,600
can be it can be a difficult task to try

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,400
to find everything and try to plug every

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,709
hole whenever they change all the time

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:50,300
right so again kind of showing here you

00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:55,490
know infrastructure and paths for

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:57,050
FedRAMP you know you have this 8004 CSPs

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,520
and then for like what we're showing

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,529
here is like different dev shops would

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,510
have stuff on topless or applications or

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,100
system owners in this case so your

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,630
system has to go through if you're using

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,829
a platform and infrastructure service

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,689
and you're not doing multi-tenancy

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:10,850
inside your application then you can use

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,020
FISMA for your application you don't

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,179
have to go through this veteran process

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,490
which is much much lighter and on top of

00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:20,230
that you get to inherit a lot of

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,400
controls out of out of the sea ESPYs

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:26,329
package in order to leverage that for

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,220
your SSP for your application alright so

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,220
that's FedRAMP all right as

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,409
see in time in 10 minutes all right so

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,780
this is the next one at DISA this it has

00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,490
their own thing which is awesome because

00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,330
that makes things so much easier to

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:43,400
understand you have basically impact

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,320
levels in DISA space so some of these

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,570
translate over some of them don't so

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,740
FedRAMP moderate will translate into

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,700
disimpact level to a FedRAMP plus which

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,950
I haven't talked about yet which is

00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,080
additional 25 controls on top of the

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,590
FedRAMP moderate will translate into a

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,240
into a diss of for impact level for what

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,309
usually comes out of from four to five

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,140
is you have to go through background

00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,429
checks yet the facility clearances you

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,799
have to have a security officer on

00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,030
on-site I mean it's a whole laundry list

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,140
of things plus you have to have

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,090
encryption between all your stuff

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,130
between the agency the list gets longer

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,840
and longer and then there's actually a

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:24,260
six as well I'm not aware of as six

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:26,120
that's out there today so some of the

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,380
basically controls I just want to kind

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,380
of pull out some of the stuff that would

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,169
apply to Drupal in particular or any CMS

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,970
really so some of these things like a c7

00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:36,890
failed login attempts account lockout so

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,470
if you need to lock out a system right

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,940
so you need to do that you need to log

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,100
it right not only do you have to do it

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,059
you have to actually report on that and

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,530
then you have to have some kind of

00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:49,340
automated learning system saying that

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,169
happened right session activity right AC

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,789
11 same thing you have to make sure that

00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:54,230
the inactivity time were actually meets

00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:55,610
those times so if you have a session

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,679
along how it's not only for drupal but

00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,870
it's also for PHP sessions rights both

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,220
so whereas drupal you have to worry

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,539
about one thing but you also have to

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,799
worry about the undercarriage which may

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,200
or may not work the same way you want

00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,940
until an auditor finds it right and then

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,730
you have to fix it and then you go to

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,320
remediation then you do a poem or

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,850
basically that's an after-action piece

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,850
you have to fix those those deficiencies

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,240
so some Drupal modules we kind of talked

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,919
about these yesterday in pretty heavy

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,630
context in some ways paranoia the first

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,120
one was the one for d7 it was used

00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,970
heavily it hasn't been updated for da

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,950
yet security review is the one it has

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,179
been the guise of civic actions have

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,009
been doing a ton of work on that

00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,869
and we actually came out of yesterday

00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,399
talking about how we're gonna or how

00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:43,049
they're going to along with other people

00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:45,509
are in the room come forward with a plan

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,119
to basically push that even faster

00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:49,470
through d8 these are just a bunch of

00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,970
ones that you can kind of see some of

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,470
them are updated first 48 and some

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,779
aren't so special Amit obviously gets

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,129
you past that AC control right password

00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,869
policy same thing you want to have

00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:02,220
complexed passwords you know in the last

00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:04,559
one should go without saying just

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,499
upgrade your stuff I mean that's I mean

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,659
I know it's a pain I mean upgrade your

00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:11,850
modules upgrade core keep it upgraded I

00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:15,240
mean that's that's the shortest way not

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:21,269
to get into a remediation step right and

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:23,190
do that with having some continuous not

00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,769
continuous Margot actually tracking your

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,940
changes change review that kind of thing

00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:28,230
you have to go through that process as

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,389
well and show that that you can document

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,629
that all right that's all the federal

00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:37,169
stuff I think so now on to quickly

00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:38,970
through a pci and HIPAA so pci i'm sure

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,929
you guys have dealt with credit cards at

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,009
some point in time your life you

00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,509
probably have a couple in your pocket

00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,580
you know that kind of thing you bought

00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,009
things so in the service provider

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:51,600
industry it's PCI DSS is the is the

00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:53,789
thing so it is this version of PCI that

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,710
they just came out with today or that

00:20:53,789 --> 00:21:00,809
this list last I think it was light of

00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:02,519
last year they did have major revamp of

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,840
love the control sets and it makes makes

00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,460
it actually more difficult to go through

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,399
but that's a good thing because now

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,340
credit cards are in theory less easy to

00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:13,470
compromise very different from the

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,269
perspective of how you know fisma and

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,679
FedRAMP work you basically get a report

00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:18,299
of compliance or a rock and then you

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,570
have a qsa or a qualified security

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,519
assessor come in and then you get an AOC

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,629
which is the same thing as an ATO right

00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,039
so that process is pretty

00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:27,419
straightforward and you can do this for

00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,259
your application it is for the

00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,749
infrastructure you do is there a

00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,580
platform it's it's all different things

00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:36,889
and I'm sure you guys have filled a sock

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:40,980
you before if you've done pci before

00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:42,600
healthcare side very very light compared

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,600
to the other ones

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,919
you know HIPAA HIPAA non-high trust is

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,240
is a you know a very easy process to go

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,669
through compared to PCI and the other

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,660
ones still has sensitivity data because

00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:59,130
you're doing with pii right so the

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,960
harder part is just making sure that

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,980
that stuff is encrypted that's the end

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,700
of the day make sure things are

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,410
encrypted both at rest and in transit

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,030
there's a base of the agreement that you

00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,380
have to sign between you and the person

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,600
that you're dealing with this is a baa

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,730
it's literally just a contract form two

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,990
usually two pages long has some stuff

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,190
and there's some stipulations saying

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,059
what you have to deal with what you're

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,710
going to do with how you're going to

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,270
deal with it and then have some instant

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:27,570
response stuff inside of it that's about

00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:31,110
it pretty straightforward so tools so

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,549
open s cap is out there god help you if

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,700
you try to write policies to it it's a

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:38,549
pain but it is there it is customizable

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,350
it is open source you can install on any

00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:42,360
Red Hat system just the timing you know

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,640
yum install you know app get for

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,710
anything on a bun to it is maintained by

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,120
NIST so you can get some policies and

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,740
some control sets out of them by default

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,720
you can write your own you can create

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,190
regression testing if you want dump it

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,559
out of Jenkins and then do code review

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,799
all that stuff is all here we talked

00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:01,110
about yesterday the code review module

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,880
and Drupal actually hooking open s cap

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,590
into that so it's a module see whenever

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,450
you do a check out from Jenkins or

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,679
something happen some event fires you

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,330
can actually run some of these policies

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,429
on top of that and then that could fail

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,799
the build things of that nature is kind

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:18,510
of what it seems like is the process

00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:21,750
kind of going into another tools Nessus

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:24,030
if you've never heard of them it won't

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,280
surprise me that they tenable is the

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,900
name of the company that owns it it is

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,130
commercial it's fairly inexpensive but

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,840
at the end of the day what it does is it

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,100
basically does credential scans or scans

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,000
on your database your code for

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,630
vulnerabilities you can use them for you

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,710
have to have an SV or a certified

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,520
scanning provider actually scan your

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,429
code or scan your site every forget

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,350
health how frequent it's pretty frequent

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:51,659
but they are actually one of those a SVS

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,009
so is qualis if you've ever done qualis

00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:58,159
before those type

00:23:54,009 --> 00:24:00,439
so in DoD space digs are popular which

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,829
are awful again if you haven't got a

00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:05,269
reoccurring theme Security's not fun

00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:07,789
it's consuming in my life for many many

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:10,459
years and as much as I love doing it it

00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:13,699
still is it's still a challenge in every

00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:14,869
every aspect they are DoD DISA backed

00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:16,399
you can download these things you can

00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,889
apply these templates of the boxes in

00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:20,779
the linux-based only rail red hat

00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:23,929
enterprise linux it has two templates

00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:25,039
for it ubuntu debian nothing i mean

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,919
there's nothing you can write your own

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,939
but they won't be certified in windows

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,029
space there's obviously stuff for

00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:33,439
windows again you can go look at these

00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:34,849
things if you want there's also a stick

00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:37,579
viewer out there that someone wrote that

00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:40,249
you could actually try to figure out

00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:43,609
what those things are again it is it is

00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:45,169
extensive logging is obviously something

00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,479
I kind of talked about a good bit here

00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:49,819
some tools so you can have open source

00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:53,659
land as elk right so last search

00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:55,639
logstash Qabbani the hard part there is

00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,019
you have to know how do you cabana blog

00:24:55,639 --> 00:25:00,289
stash stuff glasses search is fairly

00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:01,369
simple Splunk has you know an enterprise

00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,449
in our free version you can set up

00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,799
alerting inside that you can do all

00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:05,989
kinds of fun stuff inside there to

00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:09,829
basically automate your your life into

00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:11,149
your get your inbox into a point where

00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:13,339
you have so many emails coming in for

00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:16,339
alerts that you won't be able to

00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:18,109
anything else and then OS X is the other

00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:20,449
tool that you can kind of use which is I

00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:23,029
think trend micro is the one it backs

00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:24,589
that one it's basically host-based IDP

00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:26,839
so you could actually see foul foul

00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:28,609
integrity and things of that nature it

00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,249
also does host-based IDP from a firewall

00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:33,259
perspective as well alright I think

00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:35,389
actually did 35 slides in 30 minutes so

00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:37,189
that was around time so three minutes

00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:39,409
left for the next people come up any

00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:43,429
questions if you could stay at the mic

00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:44,600
so we can get it recorded sweet I bored

00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:48,610
you to death

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,610
alright cool thank you

00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:28,039
how's everyone doing today good so how

00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:29,809
many of you shop online pretty much the

00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,149
whole room I've been asking that

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:34,369
question for 10 years and over the last

00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:37,070
10 years obviously more and more of the

00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:39,259
room as said yes to that question to the

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,389
point that I was just driving by my

00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,369
local sports chalet and it was going on

00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:44,989
the business because I realized that I

00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:47,149
probably haven't walked in there in two

00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:49,879
years it's just like everyone else and

00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:52,849
what I've also realized is it works the

00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:55,219
same way with user experience and the

00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:56,959
website to shop on so you probably how

00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:58,549
many of us so you all shop online now

00:27:56,959 --> 00:28:01,639
how many of you have your favorite

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:03,440
websites the shop on right because

00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:05,779
you've decided that's the user

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,659
experience you like and it's come down

00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:10,639
to it used to be I don't want to get my

00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:12,679
car drive to a store anymore it's too

00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:14,989
inconvenient it's now come down to a

00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,269
matter of seconds right well this

00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:19,969
website is two seconds faster than this

00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:22,190
website so i like that user experience

00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:23,809
better i'm going to go on that website

00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,479
and that's where we've come to and

00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:28,820
studies show that you convert more on

00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:31,129
sites that are faster and where the user

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,799
experience is better and user experience

00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:35,989
is more than just you know the look and

00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,700
feel of the website it's there's a piece

00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:41,539
to that which is just the passage of

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,789
time and the patients we've all lost

00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:46,339
over the last number of years waiting

00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:49,309
for a website so it's become very

00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:53,029
important for your website to have high

00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:55,290
performance drupal which is open source

00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:56,970
and isn't great and the greatest benefit

00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,560
of Drupal is that it's open source but

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,200
it's also its greatest weakness right

00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,140
because anyone can do whatever they want

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,140
to it they can customize it in however

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,510
they want which is in the right hands an

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:13,230
amazing thing and in the wrong hands it

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:16,530
can cause more problems than I've seen

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,630
over my career so even though joop will

00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,000
speed can set your revenue on fire it

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:25,560
can also slow you down and cost you a

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,170
lot of money because of it so how this

00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,390
performance impact your business did you

00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:34,310
know one second delay reduces

00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,310
conversions by seven percent this was a

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,610
they looked at this a couple years ago

00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,650
and I saw the research and it's pretty

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,350
amazing because we're talking about what

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,850
could have essentially be up to almost

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,770
two and a half million dollars a year

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:50,100
annually for a site that sells a hundred

00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,540
thousand dollars a day which is a lot of

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,640
money and what we're going to do here

00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,780
today is I'm going to start here at the

00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,610
beginning going through some of these

00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,070
numbers generically but then we're going

00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,870
to show a case study in real-world

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,300
examples of one of our clients to show

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,820
you how you know the better your

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,680
performance is the more people come to

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,110
the site and the better conversion rates

00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,270
you'll have is Mark in the room from

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,220
perfectly posh so the case study we're

00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,230
going to do is for our client perfectly

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,080
possible we have one of their employees

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,400
here with us and Christians going to

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,140
come up in the minute after we go

00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,820
through this and we'll walk through the

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,490
case study of bringing them from another

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,400
hosting company over the platform and

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:31,440
the success they've had on the

00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,480
performance side and what really is

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,090
important to understand and to know that

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,880
performance isn't just related to the

00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:41,850
hosting company and it's very important

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,180
but as important is the partnership not

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:47,490
only amongst the client the hosting

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,920
company and the developer in Pasha's

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:52,760
example they are the also the developer

00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,830
they do it internally but having a

00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:59,850
partner for the development side is just

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:03,180
as important so what you'll see is as

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,920
page load times increase you have lost

00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,690
opportunity and again we'll be able to

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,970
show this in real-world examples with

00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:13,380
posh what was happening on the

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:15,900
hosting companies as they had a rush on

00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,390
the flash sale what was happening is

00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,610
people were not coming because it would

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,760
take seven eight nine ten seconds and as

00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:26,429
more people showed up the time to check

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,990
out was getting more and more because of

00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:30,419
the structure they were looking at so

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,510
people were bouncing and they would have

00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:37,020
these sales that should last an hour or

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:40,440
two and they were lasting 3 4 6 8 24

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:46,350
hours because of the fact that the site

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:48,960
was slowing down so conventional wisdom

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,809
today we were talking about seconds says

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,440
that you should have a sub 2 second page

00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:57,840
load time which personally I think is

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,570
unrealistic because of how complicated

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,370
web sites are today I think it should be

00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,549
closer to about four seconds and I'll

00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:08,850
explain that to you in a second so what

00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:11,429
we did is anyone with the IR 500 this

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:15,299
that's the top 500 largest e-commerce

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:17,970
websites in the world so I spent some

00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:21,450
time reviewing them and the average page

00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:23,280
load time in 2014 so when I did this was

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,070
a couple years ago was three point six

00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,330
seven seconds and actually what's

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,240
happened since then is it's actually

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:33,059
gotten slower so whether the way some of

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,000
the ways it can get slower I'll explain

00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:38,340
I had a client call me once and says my

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,299
website slow so let me take a look at it

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:45,210
and I bring it up and they do a trace of

00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:47,400
the site and it was 1050 calls to

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,950
generate the page something like 17

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,559
seconds to load the page and he sold

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,150
books and I said how many books do you

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,520
have what's how many ski what's your sku

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,260
count he said a thousand I said you see

00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,659
the scroll on the bottom that shows

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:03,860
about six books if you scroll through it

00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:06,840
it's actually loading all 1,000 bucks

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,760
what you need to do is have a lazy load

00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,070
so it just shows the six that are there

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,440
and as you scroll it'll load the others

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:15,539
he did that and it took it from 17

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,760
seconds down to about one and a half

00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:21,000
seconds but these are all things that

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,800
you have to be cognizant up from both

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,510
the hosting side and what things you

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,480
can do they're like caching and

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:29,340
compression but also just as important

00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,340
or things like the number of calls on

00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,950
the webpage the size of the web page all

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:39,510
of these things in concert or what makes

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:41,220
the user experience so great and as I

00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:43,620
mentioned to really do this correctly

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:47,220
you have to have a true partnership you

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:50,880
can't just have someone you hire and say

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,830
okay you want a hosting company and I'm

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,750
just going to walk away I give them the

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,150
site they're hosting it from there on

00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,070
out it's their problem or I've hired a

00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,990
development company they're supposed to

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,730
develop my site it's a partnership and

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,680
that partnership doesn't just include

00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,600
the client it includes Drupal if you're

00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,730
choosing that this year as your

00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,650
application it includes the drupal

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,330
developer and it includes the hosting

00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:15,030
partner and what you really need to do

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,860
is work together in order to have the

00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,990
best experience so when we went to posh

00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,060
the one of the big things we said in

00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:24,600
Dallas who's not here that's that's

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,870
Mark's boss it can't just we architected

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:31,380
a custom stack built for them because of

00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:34,020
the unique way they do things and I'll

00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,330
explain it in a second but they they

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,120
needed someone that could scale very

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:40,890
quickly and their current hosting

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,890
company couldn't do that they were

00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:46,350
either having a lot of downtime or they

00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:48,210
were having longer and longer page load

00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,400
time so what we were able to do was

00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,240
architect a custom stack just for them

00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:56,100
which is important so what it perfectly

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,370
posh do they have something called a

00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,610
splurge sale once a month they have

00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:05,280
45,000 independent consultants who all

00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:08,190
get an opportunity to buy one item so

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,670
they have 25,000 units and that one item

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,680
might go on sale from $25 down to six

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,310
seven eight nine dollars and they all

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,390
want to rush to the site and by this

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,910
before it runs out because once it's

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:25,020
gone it's gone frigate so what was this

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:27,360
was causing was a rush to the site but

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,300
that rushed to the site was crashing the

00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,760
site or slowing the site down so

00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,520
something that should have sold out in a

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,840
couple of hours was taking multiple day

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:43,230
to sell out so they went live with us on

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,570
March after we custom engineered a plan

00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,370
for them and after the first splurge

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,530
these were the feedback we're getting

00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,410
from their independent consultants we

00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:56,700
got things like magical easy a splurge

00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:58,830
ever all of these things that can show

00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:03,770
you pretty easily the problems they were

00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:06,930
having on the other hosting company and

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,730
what was the problem they were throwing

00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,320
hardware at the problem and they were

00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,630
throwing the heart wrong hardware at the

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,400
problem so there was really multiple

00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,070
issues you can see at one point they had

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,380
20 web heads at some points they had 30

00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,330
and 40 web heads I can tell you we're

00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,310
currently at 10 and we're not running

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,820
out of resources I think we finally hit

00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:30,000
the we might add one more now we add an

00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:34,590
11th they were at 30 or 40 they were

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,920
throwing the wrong hardware at it's

00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,330
crazy so what did they do when they

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,130
moved to platform so I'm going to bring

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,890
Christian up now and he's kind of walk

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,170
us through what we did in the different

00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,910
phases to get them from having all the

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:55,890
problems they had on the other guys to

00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:59,010
the most magical splurge ever all right

00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:03,030
hi everyone so the typical deployment we

00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:05,670
do for an enterprise hosting solution is

00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:07,920
that we have three hosts all load

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:11,070
balanced across each other for both web

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,610
requests for database requests and for

00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:17,460
caching and for search of use a search

00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,380
service for like solar for example with

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,760
posh we wanted to scale out beyond that

00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,380
because they had so many requests coming

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,120
and we knew that they were typically at

00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,160
20 web heads with their previous

00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,080
solution and so we needed to do

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,580
something slightly different and what we

00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,790
did is go through their requirements

00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,140
look at where they were bottlenecked in

00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,000
terms of their performance reporting

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,560
from their previous hosts and worked out

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,950
a solution that we thought would work

00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,720
but we left a lot of time to plan and

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,790
look at that solution and evaluate it

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,320
and test it before the go-live point

00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,210
because we wanted to have success out of

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,620
the gate and we didn't want to have to

00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,140
prove

00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,190
two of these environments to do testing

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,530
in the future because that would have

00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,390
been very expensive for them and so we

00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,070
left some space for us to use the

00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:02,750
production environment in a test phase

00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:06,410
before we deployed so let's see I'll

00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:08,090
leave this up here for a sec exactly so

00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,380
the first thing we did is we decided

00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,570
because we need to load balance across

00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,280
more web heads will deploy an additional

00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,050
set of web heads there are all the same

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,540
size so it's easy for elastic load

00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:19,250
balancer on AWS to work with and then we

00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,140
left the core what we call the chord

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,810
servers the original three hosts were

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,700
just used for the database for caching

00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,800
and for solar they weren't serving

00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,510
anymore web requests and the main reason

00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,720
we did that is both for the load

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:35,480
balancing and because we wanted them to

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,510
use the full amount of CPU and I oh we

00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,120
put those hosts on AWS instances which

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:45,170
are specific for storage they were using

00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:49,220
SSDs rather than the metal based network

00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:51,050
file system called EBS on AWS because we

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,400
wanted heiio performance they had seen a

00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,620
lot of database trouble on their

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,500
previous hosting company and so by

00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:59,690
splitting those we were able to optimize

00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,930
each set of hardware for the performance

00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:04,580
results we needed we also planned to use

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,930
reedus for caching which is what we

00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,880
typically support they had been using

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:10,100
memcache this will come back to this

00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,440
later it becomes important and we

00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,570
decided to add fastly for a full page

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,540
cache and the advantage of fastly being

00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:19,670
that we could add essentially fastly is

00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:22,310
varnish as of service it allowed them to

00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:25,280
implement a few things in a custom vcl

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:27,170
file a custom varnish file that allowed

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,390
them to do configuration where pieces of

00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,890
their page would be loaded via the cash

00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:35,810
and then other pieces would be lazy

00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:38,000
loaded into the page via HX so this is

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:40,340
what the system the system normally just

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,160
has the three hosts that you see in

00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:45,890
yellow green blue and those are all

00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,870
three hosts appt 1 2 3 and DB 1 2 3

00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,180
would be all together but by moving

00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,980
those out we were able to pick the

00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,210
correct hardware for the DB host and

00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,520
pick the correct hardware for the

00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,410
application hosts as doug said we

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,780
initially structured them with 10

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:01,140
application hosts that just run engine X

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,180
and php-fpm

00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,869
we have since added on 11th that was

00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,400
just last week and then the DB one two

00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:11,460
three hosts are running on instances

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,880
which are optimized for i/o and also are

00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,619
much larger in CPU terms as well so and

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,839
those hosts are running my sequel in a

00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,910
galera cluster they also have reduced

00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:22,740
instances and solar instances that know

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:26,039
how to failover to one another and a

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:28,109
high-availability set up and there's a

00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,299
little backup post off to the side which

00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:32,309
we is also replicating from the glare

00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:35,579
cluster we should adjust this diagram

00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:38,130
slightly but and that's just a read-only

00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:40,829
copy so in the event of complete

00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,329
disastrous failure on all three of the

00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:43,980
database host we still have a backup

00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:49,619
that we could restore from which is is

00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:51,630
isolated from those machines so that

00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,369
that was the custom engineering we did

00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:56,670
on the hardware side and we said okay we

00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:58,619
think we are ready to move into a

00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,150
testing phase and so what we did is we

00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:01,950
looked at a number of load testing tools

00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,140
we decided to go with blaze meter some

00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:06,569
of the engineers at posh had used blaze

00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,509
meter before and we said we need you to

00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:11,490
write the initial jmeter scripts that

00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:14,069
will run this performance testing

00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,960
because while we know what a drupal

00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:17,789
commerce application looks like their

00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,529
application was quite custom their

00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:22,079
workflows or custom we needed their

00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:24,180
expertise to go and say this is what a

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,730
customer workflow will be these are the

00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,450
pages it will hit this is what a sale

00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:33,180
experience looks like to us okay and

00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,890
when that was done we would then toss it

00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:37,619
into blaze meter and say okay I want to

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:39,119
run 600 of these at a time and observe

00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,039
what happened and we had enough time

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,099
spaced out before their launch that we

00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,690
were able to do this repeatedly and

00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,640
evaluate in all of our load testing

00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,970
tools which mostly was New Relic but

00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:54,529
also in black fire and other monitoring

00:41:50,970 --> 00:42:01,500
to say where are the difficulties here

00:41:54,529 --> 00:42:04,819
whoops what did I do something wrong no

00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,819
I think your laptop suspended

00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm clearly not exciting enough for this

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,720
laptop um so these are this is an

00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,350
example that we have from New Relic on

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,820
both hosts on the right side you can see

00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:29,000
another thing we discovered is that they

00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,710
under in high load situations we're

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,360
crashing due to memcache becoming

00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,580
unavailable and you can see the majority

00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,830
of the page request time there is from

00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,450
memcache taking really almost eighty

00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,280
percent of the request time and that's

00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,080
because the memcache instances they had

00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,200
were not load balanced and and simply

00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,210
were not enough what we discovered as

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,710
soon as we put this on read us on our

00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,020
side was that this actually was a

00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,460
bandwidth issue that the hosts talking

00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,880
to one another only have limited

00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:58,160
bandwidth within AWS and with that

00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,640
number of requests were peaking at well

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,400
over one gigabit per second in raw data

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,750
transfer because Pasha's developers had

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,850
done a pretty good job and we're cashing

00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,320
absolutely everything they could which

00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,240
is normally a good decision and you

00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,000
don't anticipate that bandwidth is going

00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,550
to be a problem and so what I did is

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,370
quickly threw together an upgrade to the

00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:21,290
Redis drupal module that compressed that

00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,410
data and was able to then uncompress it

00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:26,960
on the fly this has a CPU cost we said

00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,300
adding CPU is easy adding bandwidth to

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,550
AWS instances as hard we will solve the

00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,770
problem in the quick and dirty way and

00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,500
that worked extremely successfully so

00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,030
once we resolve that problem and because

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,240
we were working so closely together

00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:43,700
during this load testing phase we were

00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,940
able to identify and fix that within a

00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,830
matter of days once we got that solved

00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:52,160
we see that we have a much more normal

00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:56,030
request profile here with the majority

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,770
of your time being in my sequel requests

00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:59,480
to places that you would expect for a

00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,670
Drupal application essentially and we

00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,920
were able to knock that average time

00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,860
down substantially even under very high

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,780
load another thing we ran into and this

00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,510
shows how the partnership was very

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,870
effective is we saw initially during the

00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:16,370
load testing that they were hitting

00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,660
database calls that were locking in a

00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,310
way that you would not normally have

00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,750
expected that a particular table was

00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:23,030
being locked in it it was flowing down

00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,710
all of the subsequent requests well as

00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,880
it turned out the load testing script

00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,980
itself was

00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,390
suming a profile that was not accurate

00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,830
they were assuming that all of these

00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,840
requests would go to a single

00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:34,520
consultants website rather than be

00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,830
distributed among their 45,000

00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,110
consultants so they were really testing

00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,670
as if the company was you know several

00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:43,580
orders of magnitude larger than it

00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,780
actually is and we with multiple pairs

00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,490
of eyes on it we were able to identify

00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,800
that relatively quickly and get that

00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,930
fixed and so that's sort of back and

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,700
forth almost agile process and

00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:56,540
partnership enabled us to move forward

00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,800
very quickly on this so here here's some

00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,130
comparison numbers we got these from

00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,230
Dallas who is their engineering director

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,750
average time it takes it took for our

00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:09,260
queries under similar load went down to

00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:12,250
you know on the order of milliseconds um

00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:16,480
you know from two milliseconds down 2.2

00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:18,470
eight times faster with Redis

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,550
substantial improvements on the database

00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:24,050
layer also right and as I talked about

00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:25,880
memcache have been accounting for a lot

00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,170
of that time we suspected the problem

00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,490
with memcache on the other host was

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,380
similar to the bandwidth problem we

00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,080
discovered we don't have anything we

00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,400
didn't have enough information to

00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:39,080
necessarily see that but that is a

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,310
strong suspicion we had so having gone

00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,770
through that load testing we felt like

00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:44,690
we were relatively well prepared go i

00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:46,700
was on march fifth we did a prep call

00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,100
for the first floor john march 21st and

00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:52,010
we decided we need to upsize database

00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,660
hosts and for us up sizing is a

00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,670
relatively simple process because

00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,410
everything is a high-availability setup

00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,420
if i turn off one of the hosts the other

00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,950
two respond normally if the host i

00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:04,460
turned off happened to be the leader

00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:06,200
that would fail over automatically so we

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,590
did that we up sized one of the database

00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,330
host brought it back up it takes in

00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:14,210
their setup because they're using SSDs

00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:16,640
an ephemeral storage on Amazon that

00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:18,380
takes about 10 to 15 minutes to sync all

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,690
of the data back over to the rebooted

00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:23,180
host and then we were able to make that

00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:26,720
larger host the primary so it could

00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:30,200
accept reads and writes so the splurge

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,140
went well we saw the site under severe

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,110
load for roughly 17 minutes during that

00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,330
time about 14,000 out of the 25,000

00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,320
units sold and then at that point the

00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,550
site was not under

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:49,610
stress anymore and sorry yeah oh it's

00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:51,050
all here at that point the the remaining

00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:53,870
units sold out over the course of the

00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:56,450
next I think 23 hours to get through

00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:58,970
there 25,000 in comparison the previous

00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:01,700
forage in February was a total disaster

00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:05,150
the site went down and could not be

00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,770
restored for many many hours and so that

00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:09,560
took several days for those items to

00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:13,250
sell out the January splurge was not as

00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,110
bad with the other hosting company they

00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,270
had somewhat fewer requests per minute

00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:22,370
but the server time to fulfill those was

00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:23,690
roughly oh no I don't know oh maybe

00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:30,110
you're not because you're not plugged in

00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:32,780
now that did you run out of battery did

00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:36,170
that really I think you did get a power

00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:38,590
brick yeah sorry everyone we're almost

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,590
done though

00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,670
forest plot gets here

00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,320
hopefully it comes back

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,950
we're extremely good at DevOps I promise

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,400
obviously it's time to buy a new battery

00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:02,950
no not yet no no

00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:15,319
we're almost done kill miss Mars yeah

00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,830
well we're getting this back up anyone

00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,950
have any questions Christian can answer

00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:30,370
while I do this will do Q&A right now

00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:30,370
for a couple minutes nothing

00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:55,619
yeah it doesn't like that went down yeah

00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:55,619
you see what happens make any sense

00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:12,429
no they want me to upgrade

00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:23,419
I think it was just grabs actually right

00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:26,539
no there was the April splurge sterile

00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:35,539
so it's worthwhile yeah I know that off

00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:38,499
the top of my head he also have we're

00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:38,499
back sorry guys

00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:56,249
are you finished yeah perfect okay

00:50:56,609 --> 00:51:03,729
exactly so with we saw roughly twenty to

00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:05,650
twenty-five percent load times at both

00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:07,660
at the database level and at the server

00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,609
level just the time to get a request in

00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,529
to load a page had been reduced by

00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:14,380
nearly seventy five to eighty percent

00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:16,690
for the March splurge and like I said

00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,579
that was about 17 minutes of very heavy

00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,680
load where the database hosts were

00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:22,660
essentially maxed out on cpu and that

00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,549
was the bottleneck and we took steps to

00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,130
try and alleviate that both identifying

00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:29,499
problematic queries and upgrades on our

00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,180
side to the database layer so

00:51:29,499 --> 00:51:32,829
approaching the april surged we did the

00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:36,460
same thing we up sighs the database

00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:39,339
hosts and prepared for the the moment of

00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,359
truth and during an april surged we saw

00:51:39,339 --> 00:51:42,160
much different performance

00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:44,829
characteristics the peak requests per

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,309
minute went up from just above 7000 to

00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:49,720
just about 9,000 for march their gross

00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:51,609
sales per hour went up thirty one

00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,269
percent and they saw higher peak users

00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:57,219
on the site and this meant that the site

00:51:55,269 --> 00:51:58,839
was under load rather than for just 17

00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:01,239
minutes was under old for full 45

00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:02,979
minutes and the times had gone up

00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:05,469
slightly because of this increased

00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:08,410
concurrency of requests but they sold

00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:10,479
out all 25,000 items within that 45

00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:13,329
minutes rather than the three-plus hours

00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:15,519
we saw just the previous month and so

00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:17,469
what we've seen is that immediately we

00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,630
saw a change in customer behavior as

00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:21,789
soon as these customers realized that

00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:23,650
the hosting problem had gone away now

00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:25,539
they knew oh we need to get in here and

00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:28,479
get these items really quickly because

00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:30,789
otherwise they will be gone and that you

00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:32,680
know we saw that and realize that we had

00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:35,229
not prepared quite adequately because

00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,849
under that sort of load we saw increased

00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:38,650
performance times and so we explored

00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:40,660
additional things that we can do which

00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:43,299
included increasing the pool PHP workers

00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,769
we added an additional web server we

00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:46,630
asked posh to look at a specific

00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:49,329
database query that was causing a lot of

00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,579
trouble and we also added a new feature

00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:53,410
this isn't on the slide but we added a

00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:55,479
feature which allows us to load balance

00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:57,219
read requests between the three web

00:52:55,479 --> 00:52:59,380
servers which are typically there just

00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:01,630
for high availability what this endpoint

00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:03,609
allowed us to do is say to the

00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,630
application layer okay use this as your

00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:06,550
secondary data

00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,290
base within the Drupal configuration and

00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:10,960
Drupal has the ability to point many of

00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:13,810
its queries views in particular at one

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,580
secondary database but on our side that

00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:17,560
secondary data base n point will load

00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,540
balance between all three of the

00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,640
database hosts and so we anticipate that

00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,220
the next words will see all three

00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,320
database posts under substantial load

00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,480
but not the nearly the max load that we

00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,280
were seeing with just the one under

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,140
previous circumstances and so we feel

00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,300
very well prepared and we're hoping that

00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,640
we'll get the sail down from 45 minutes

00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:40,780
to 20 or 30 depending on customer

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:43,150
behavior so all right we have just a

00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:45,610
couple of charts showing bandwidth per

00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,770
minute I think we peaked at about 500

00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:49,660
megabytes per second or per minute in

00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:52,960
bandwidth coming out of fastly and

00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:55,300
around 30,000 requests per minute from

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,640
fastly which translated into just over

00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:01,120
9000 at the origin so they were serving

00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:04,060
more requests of cash static assets and

00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:07,840
cached page frames that were then filled

00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:10,450
in with customer data after the fact so

00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,430
the takeaway here is that performance is

00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,440
driven by by both of these components

00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:16,630
both what's you code and how well the

00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,910
infrastructure is suited for it and the

00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,560
partnership that we have offered on the

00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:23,650
platform SH side to work with customers

00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:25,360
on the back and forth of fixing each of

00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:27,400
these issues in tandem and making

00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:30,310
progress on them together is something

00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,570
that has benefited Pasha immensely their

00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,400
conversion rates that revenue are

00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,200
directly tied to that performance this

00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,240
is an extreme example obviously most

00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,940
sites don't have the sort of load where

00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,140
they're going to crash during a sale but

00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,750
that's why this was such a great

00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,580
experience because we knew that the

00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,370
effects would be dramatic if we could

00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:50,470
solve these problems the pro playing

00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:53,860
step was really important being able to

00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:55,510
look and say we know exactly where these

00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:58,030
problems have occurred and which

00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:59,530
problems we need to solve and so we

00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:01,420
leverage server side tools to do that

00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:04,210
both to see where the problems are and

00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:06,970
then to go back analyze code optimize it

00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,830
all those things and so we feel like

00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,660
that partnership has been a benefit both

00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,490
to us in being able to improve our

00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,260
product and obviously to perfectly posh

00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:16,750
for being able to improve the experience

00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,850
for their customers and it's clear to us

00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:21,550
that their customers agree

00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:23,590
so I go back for one second because i

00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:25,750
love this graph again and if you think

00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:28,090
about it they we said on the other guys

00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:31,050
they were peaking at about six thousand

00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:33,460
rpms and then crashing we got up to

00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:35,830
30,000 going through fastly so that

00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,410
gives you a sense of the magnitude of

00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:40,570
the performance benefit we provided to

00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:42,550
them and it's working still and it's

00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:46,060
working stills so we've been able to

00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:47,830
scale it five times already within two

00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,110
months of going live and it's going to

00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,150
get better and better and better and if

00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,680
you want to ask mark he's back there and

00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,740
I'm sure he'll answer a few questions

00:55:53,680 --> 00:56:00,210
for you so he I could even bring them up

00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:05,200
you guys have any questions for him now

00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:06,820
nothing so we are in booth 524 in the

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,560
exhibit hall if you have any questions

00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,540
or want to see a demo of platform

00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,490
Christian is giving demos all day please

00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:15,970
come by the booth right by the coffee

00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:18,460
yeah and as a side note we already hosts

00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:20,140
some of the largest too polite sites in

00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:22,120
the world that are live I think we have

00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,400
one that's got five or six million page

00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,350
views a month which isn't massive but

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,730
for Drupal 8 it's one of the largest out

00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,290
there and we're just going to keep

00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,360
adding more and more and getting bigger

00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:35,580
and bigger so if you guys have any

00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,580
questions please come to the booth okay

00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,950
