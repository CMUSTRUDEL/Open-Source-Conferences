Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Becoming a TPM: Dos and Don'ts of Technical Project Management
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	With everything going on in life: kids, doctor appointments, car repairs, reality show auditions, aren’t we ALL really project managers? No, we are not. "Doing several related things" isn’t a project, and being in their general vicinity isn’t project management.

Successful project managers in the Drupal world require both interpersonal skills and technical skills. Lacking either, we become panicked appointment setters or bitter ex-project managers.

Two experienced Drupal project managers will cover what skills are needed, how to really figure out what you are good at, and what to add to your toolbelt. This will include:

Project lifecycle management
Agile, Waterfall, and Phased Polaron Methodologies
Why Projects Fail or Succeed: Tales from The Front Lines
Debugging Machines vs. Debugging Humans 
Tools of the Technical Project Management Trade
Metrics, Reporting, and Documentation
If you are a beginner you will emerge from this session with an expert’s perspective on project management. You will garner the respect of all around you. You will gain authority where once there was only derision. Your words will command a respect usually entrusted only to bartenders. Your projects will be overflowing with laughter, back-slaps, moments majestic and intervals sublime.
