Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Becoming a TPM: Dos and Don'ts of Technical Project Management
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	With everything going on in life: kids, doctor appointments, car repairs, reality show auditions, aren’t we ALL really project managers? No, we are not. "Doing several related things" isn’t a project, and being in their general vicinity isn’t project management.

Successful project managers in the Drupal world require both interpersonal skills and technical skills. Lacking either, we become panicked appointment setters or bitter ex-project managers.

Two experienced Drupal project managers will cover what skills are needed, how to really figure out what you are good at, and what to add to your toolbelt. This will include:

Project lifecycle management
Agile, Waterfall, and Phased Polaron Methodologies
Why Projects Fail or Succeed: Tales from The Front Lines
Debugging Machines vs. Debugging Humans 
Tools of the Technical Project Management Trade
Metrics, Reporting, and Documentation
If you are a beginner you will emerge from this session with an expert’s perspective on project management. You will garner the respect of all around you. You will gain authority where once there was only derision. Your words will command a respect usually entrusted only to bartenders. Your projects will be overflowing with laughter, back-slaps, moments majestic and intervals sublime.

okay so in this session we're here to

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,629
talk about becoming a technical project

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,680
manager now we've got a nice full room

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,150
today so if you do have any questions

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,610
we're going to have a spot at the end

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,110
where we can do some Q&A but before then

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,389
if you do have anything you can go onto

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,630
Twitter and just type the question and

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,449
put the hashtag Drupal TPM Jason he's

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,400
our scrum master today so he's going to

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,859
be shouting out question and so feel

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,119
free to be engaged during this we're

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,529
also going to have be taking

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,029
collaborative notes that are going up

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,590
there are going to be a lot of resources

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,840
and different tools that we're talking

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,399
about don't worry too much about writing

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,649
every single one of them down because

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,020
we're going to give you a full list with

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,160
like notes and links and everything else

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,379
that you're going to be alright so my

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,690
name is Jesse Fisher I work in kind of

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,100
technical client services at campion a

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,449
lot of my work is around kind of

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,559
onboarding projects and getting people

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,300
set up I've been with Drupal since 2011

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,039
and I moved in from a pretty non

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,070
technical rule into doing some pretty

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,049
kind of like highly technical stuff cool

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,780
and my name is NaN Stefanik I currently

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,150
own and run a Drupal shop called canopy

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,580
studios and I've been working triple

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,369
since 2007 back in the days of 46 and

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,490
flexi note dark dark time but here we

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,439
are today and I came from a very

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,759
non-technical place as I get teased

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,950
because I sometimes say I'm

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,509
non-technical but I tend to do most of

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,729
the scopes of work and a lot of the

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,020
sales proposals so here we are Jesse and

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,520
I are here to share tips and tricks and

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,350
help everybody learn more about

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,009
technical project management well so

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,479
we're going to start off with a

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,640
definition to have a technical project

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,640
manager and originally I wanted to title

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,009
this talk super hero cat herding project

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,329
management is usually called herding

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,860
cats because you have a lot of different

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,540
people and you have to get them all in

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,700
the right place when you add in the

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,320
technical aspect of that that's when it

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,939
gets to the level of being super hero

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,890
cat

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,869
so you're going to see a lot of cats on

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,770
all of our slides today and that's kind

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,240
of what we're going to be referencing so

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,090
starting off with what a technical or a

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,590
project manager at that level does

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,420
you're really just responsible for the

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,280
planning and the execution and the

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,100
monitoring and the control and kind of

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,780
the closure of a project there are four

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,370
basic aspects that go into this and

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,620
we're going to be referencing a lot of

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,900
these aspects in Jack today the first

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,000
one is being a bridge you are going to

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,950
be the bridge between kind of the the

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,780
clients problem and what the ultimate

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,489
solution to that problem is and also

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,430
kind of bridging in between your client

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,260
and your developers you're also going to

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,940
be gatekeeping a lot you need to protect

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,769
your developers protect their time

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,930
protect kind of the scope of the project

00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,950
and everything that's going on and

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,130
you're going to be doing a lot of

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,840
Education for the client telling them

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,989
what the process is and kind of like

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,430
what is and isn't possible in this world

00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,620
and then the even trickier thing that

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,780
you have to learn how to do is to kind

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,329
of see how in the future and anticipate

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,600
issues before they bubble up into an

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,160
explosion and a bad situation and you

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,560
want to do all this so in the end you

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,910
can deliver a project that everybody

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,950
really feels good about so when I talk

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,049
about bridging they're kind of two lions

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,450
that you're going to be bridging in

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,970
between and these two lions are very

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,790
different creatures with very very

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,310
different needs so the first line we

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,470
have this is your client this is your

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,980
business partner the needs of this

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,140
client have clients need meetings they

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,390
need a lot of updates about progress

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,650
about blockers and other issues you're

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,940
going to spend a lot of time on the

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,910
phone with them and doing Google

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,680
Hangouts and chaps and things like that

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,959
they also need really well defined

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,030
expectations and they need to be

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,830
educated about this process so that they

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,510
have proper expectations and they

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,000
feel like they're surprised or that

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,500
they've been kind of lied to in any way

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,900
and they also need to have some of their

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,100
big ambitions and dreams brought down

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,780
into reality and the way to do this and

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,300
what they really really need is kind of

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,700
firm empathy don't be afraid to tell a

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,520
client note you just need to do it in

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,330
kind of a kind and understanding way so

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,730
your developer lion has very different

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,070
needs from the client line they need to

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,630
be heads down to get the work done they

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,760
don't need a lot of distractions around

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,440
them they also need somebody who can

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,700
speak their language so that they feel

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,340
like you really give me that you

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,050
understand that they need a lot of help

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,000
being able to communicate kind of what

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,220
the technical problem is or what what

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,050
issues are going on and communicating

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,870
out to the client and also communicating

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,460
kind of those red flags that can come up

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,050
you need to feed them and you need to

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,060
feed them with properly defined tasks

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,790
you don't want to go to a developer and

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,710
just say hey build me a website see ya

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,600
the month you want to be able to break

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,700
it down into bite-size tasks you can

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,940
continually feed them to get the project

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,890
to the end point and finally they need

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,610
to be fed also with lots of words of

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:04,950
encouragement both in failure and also

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:07,110
in successes okay so we're going to talk

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,820
a little bit now about the definition of

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,260
a technical project manager and how that

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,910
differs a little bit from an actual

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,740
project manager so let me see if I can

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,360
do this so a TPM is one of those

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,280
competent folks who grew up through the

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,930
technical ranks and really took his or

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,030
her place through wit skill and the

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,930
ability to communicate clearly to

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,970
non-technical audiences these people

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,040
clearly under the understand the full

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,919
stack and know how to walk the walk and

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,260
most often talk the talk Oh made that

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,410
bad versa they could talk the talk and

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,419
most often walk the walk these people

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,520
are the really key defining factor

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,020
between a technical project manager and

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,450
a project manager is that they can

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,180
communicate effectively with a

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,760
non-technical audience they're usually

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,060
very able to estimate and troubleshoot

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,860
has they have there been there done that

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,560
now remember you don't have to be a

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,990
developer to be a good technical project

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,550
manager but it sure does give you a step

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:12,550
in the right direction so every project

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,640
has time money and features as the three

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,950
pillars and only one gets to win if you

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,660
have a very busy project the timelines

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,400
are the most important thing you may

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,080
have to sacrifice some features or maybe

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,850
the client has to pay overtime to get it

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,010
done but either way there's only one

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,020
pillar that wins the difference on the

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,150
perspective from a technical project

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,130
manager is that you were hyper focused

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,990
on features and you somehow you

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,330
magically have to make all of these

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,150
features work within a certain number of

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,830
budget or a certain amount of time so

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,180
that's really the focuses of a technical

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,040
project managers they're trying to

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,600
figure out the actual solution to get

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:52,000
the job done within the constraints that

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:54,100
they're being forced to so let's talk a

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,800
little bit about day-to-day of a

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,270
technical project manager and a lot of

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,010
this does sound a lot the same as a

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,360
project manager but one of the big

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,490
things is is that you're going to write

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,830
a lot of reports and if you're coming

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,090
from a developer it means that really

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,070
writing things down in real time

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,590
thinking about how to document it and

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,610
that can be really challenging but it's

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,710
something that's going to become your

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,080
best friend essentially you want to

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,760
become a really good firefighter and you

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,460
want to actually take away the kindling

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,080
and matches from your clients and even

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,020
your developers and good documentation

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,300
is a great place to start you're going

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,530
to send emails like a lot of email and

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,640
then you're going to phone a lot of

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,960
people and you're going to slack people

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,170
and you're going to text people and

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,430
you're gonna send some more emails

00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,810
another thing a technical project

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,470
manager does is they help prioritize

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,450
issues and that goes as identifying the

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,650
problem that's potentially at the root

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,750
of several problems so as a technical

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,850
project manager urine point you're in

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,160
charge of employing strategies for risk

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,590
mitigation and this is on the technical

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,910
level and I got to say the most common

00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,770
thing that a technical project manager

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,200
does that's different from a project

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,060
manager is they pull at least one person

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,030
per day out of a tempting

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:13,690
at all otherwise known as an unrelated

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:15,820
technical problem so there are kind of

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,050
two tracks to getting into technical

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,090
project management that we're going to

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,160
outline today the first one's going to

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,470
be talking about a project manager to

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,889
technical project manager and then also

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,419
from going from a dev to a TPM if you're

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,220
starting from Ground Zero and you want

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:31,540
to get into this world like the next few

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,330
slides you're just going to have to

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:39,760
learn kind of all of it so as a project

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,710
manager to get to a technical project

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,930
manager you have to become technical

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,790
this can be a little bit overwhelming

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,040
when you start to get into this world

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,510
and I think it's really better to think

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,120
about it in these three major categories

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,760
when you're starting out one you need to

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,279
understand the structure of turmoil you

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,779
need to understand the lingo that people

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,660
are using if you check out drupal.org

00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:03,910
there's a glossary that's on there read

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,310
it understand it get the language in the

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,170
words that people are using and you also

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,300
want to kind of deconstruct a finished

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,740
project it's kind of like doing reverse

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,240
engineering when you were a kid and you

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,339
wanted to be like how does this phone

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,760
work you get a screwdriver you open it

00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:20,050
up and then get built up by your parents

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,970
you also want to kind of understand the

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,410
stack for drupal basics you know you

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,670
have a server you have the operating

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,830
system that's on that and then you have

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,200
the application of course it's far far

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,910
far more complicated than that but at a

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,430
really base level that's kind of how you

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,380
want to start conceptualising it now

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,030
once you understand the structure you

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,250
want to understand the tools to

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,260
manipulate that structure how do you get

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,850
in how you build these things how do you

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,740
take something that's already been built

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,270
and start to manipulate it further what

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,530
are the tools that you'll be using and

00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,620
don't worry we're going to give you a

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,540
little list of all this outside of that

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,040
once it's built it's been manipulated

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,780
you know all this stuff how do you

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,100
investigate what a problem is because

00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,110
the set of tools that you use for

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,500
testing and kind of investigating and

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,260
debugging are different than the tools

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,760
we be using to build there are a lot of

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,890
Drupal training resources that are out

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,540
there and again on the notes we're going

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,390
to give you a huge old big list and

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:17,820
you're also a Drupal cotton so there are

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:20,490
a few other resources here as well it's

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,870
really hard to just set to spin up a

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,360
site if you're a non-technical person

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,240
looking to be a technical person so like

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,920
Jesse said you know go and connect with

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,220
your community but taking something

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,570
apart is so much easier to understand

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,370
because it also gives you a foundation

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,140
to which you can ask questions with ya

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,910
when I started getting into this people

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,620
were telling me like people who knew

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,780
this really well we're like well it's

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,420
easy you just go in and you like spin up

00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,610
like a lamp stack and you just start

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,960
building a site but when you come in it

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,910
from that angle it can be really

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,890
overwhelming because you don't know what

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,990
modules you need to be picking out like

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,840
there are just so many options you don't

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,240
even know where to begin so what I

00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,920
recommend doing is to actually see if

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,510
you can get somebody here and and we'll

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,490
try to get you like a repository is

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,780
something that you can pull down because

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,280
if you can look at a finished project

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,870
and you can look at something that's

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,030
already been built out instead of just a

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,650
skeleton bare bones Drupal site you can

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,180
start to get a sense of all the

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,620
different components that can be in

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,330
there and then you could take it and

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,860
also start breaking in a little bit to

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,290
see what happens when you change like a

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,020
small line of code here play around with

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,860
it and start investigating it that way

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,540
another thing you should get really

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,970
familiar with are things like stack

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,630
exchange stack overflow reading through

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,860
drupal org if you have a problem

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,710
somebody else has already had that

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,720
problem as well most likely so when you

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,339
go in here like you can go read and see

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,260
what issues people are having in

00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,750
different areas and just like be curious

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,860
check out threads that have been on like

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,630
views and different kinds of

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,820
integrations and stuff like that and

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,490
it's kind of a pro tip about stock

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,980
exchange and stack overflow the top

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,190
voted answer is not always the best

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,870
answer sometimes it's just been sitting

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,250
there for a while and it's just gathered

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,660
a bunch of up votes on it and then

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,280
threat is kind of an abandoned nobody's

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,810
looking at it and somebody else comes

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,660
along that actually has a much better

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,820
answer and you don't see it so learn to

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,560
just like read down and you know use

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,360
your your own perspective to kind of

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,070
analyze it see what their arguments are

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,430
and then maybe try and play around with

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,600
what their answer is another thing is

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,790
learning the fine art of boolean

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,500
searching I work kind of more in the

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,510
technical support space and people love

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,080
to make this joke ha let me google that

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,660
for you it's surprisingly hard to be

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,670
able to use a search engine effectively

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,590
beyond just like boolean search

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,570
operators will give you a little link

00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,730
for the search operators that you can

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,320
specifically use with google to be able

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,820
to kind of drill down because you're

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,700
trying to find like this tiny little

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,100
answer this needle in a digital haystack

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,660
and also don't be afraid to kind of play

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,640
around with what your search terms are

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,680
you can try one tack of like you know

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,270
this piece of the error code and like

00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,950
not including Drupal in there but if you

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,650
include the word Drupal in there you

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,570
make it a very different set of answers

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,520
so always be refining your search terms

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,680
and learn how to be able to use search

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,450
operators to kind of narrow it down and

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,070
keep going through the pages until you

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,160
start to see the results you're looking

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,450
for just on that note we I worked with a

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,180
very senior developer was one of my

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:22,089
inspirations his name is nick lewis he's

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,170
super awesome and when I how did you how

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,800
did you learn all this he's like I

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,589
learned how to use Google Oh so step one

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,720
it's not learn to google and the last

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,160
piece in here like outside of having an

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,720
internet connection and being able to

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,370
like read all these forums that are in

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,360
here go to meet ups smart people love

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,000
talking about what they're passionate

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,080
about if you show up and you ask

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,390
questions like don't be afraid to say so

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,430
what is this PHP thing like what is

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,530
javascript just start asking questions

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,690
and they'll usually be really happy to

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,830
give you answers possibly more answers

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,670
than you thought you were going to get

00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:01,680
out of that question so once you've done

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,270
your research start to get into hands-on

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,670
learning this stuff is going to be a lot

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,970
easier if you are a project manager

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,460
already at a company start getting into

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,110
support like go back read the support

00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,550
tickets you'll start to get a sense and

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,650
this will help you build up your sense

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,360
of being able to anticipate you can look

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,190
at the history of what's in there the

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,720
problems that have come up and then kind

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,700
of the resolutions and the answers that

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,590
are in there and don't be afraid to

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,330
start offering yourself up and be like I

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,890
will take those low level tickets

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,330
because you can always ask somebody on

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,490
your team for a little bit of help and

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,110
will be really happy and thankful that

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,840
you came in to take some of the work

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,510
that's coming in also creating

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,330
documentation nobody likes creating

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,560
documentation so if you come in and just

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,630
ask someone at your company whose

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,610
technical and say hey you know I know we

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,920
don't have a piece of documentation on

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,050
like this aspect about DNS can you write

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,580
me an outline and if they can just write

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,500
you a small outline you can start

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,170
working on it and use those things like

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,730
stack exchange stack overflow searching

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,440
too if you don't know what a term is

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,270
just look it up and you can start to

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,130
write a draft for it and then pass it on

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,690
to them and then you know get their

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,730
edits and their feedback and everything

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,890
and this is really going to help you one

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,870
feel comfortable being an authority and

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,850
talking about this stuff to clients and

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,060
then also really you know learning it

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,310
learning all these components and pieces

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:23,700
if your company has emergency on call

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,430
get on that volunteer yourself to go

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,260
work communications a 2 a.m. emergency

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,390
alert is a pretty lonely place to be

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,830
when you're all by yourself and having

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,780
somebody there to be able to run

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,300
communications is really really helpful

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,920
and you get to watch in real time as

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,900
like a website or something is going

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,610
down somebody's going in debugging

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,170
figuring out what the problem is and

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,029
then offering a solution to

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,980
problem and it's going to teach you how

00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,690
to like what can go wrong where these

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,339
fires can come up and again going to

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,339
teach you the technical aspects and how

00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:56,490
to anticipate the big thing in this is

00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:59,100
take notes ask questions and like take

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,959
on as many tiny tasks as you can and

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,880
especially take on the task that you

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,860
don't think are going to be overwhelming

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,930
but you're slightly uncomfortable and

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,949
unprepared to take on because those are

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,019
the moments where you're going to have

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,959
to push yourself to really learn and

00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,970
really figure out what's going on and

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,500
just to augment on that I know with some

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,600
of our project managers that are keen to

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,540
become more technical we get them to

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,639
start doing the QA which is quality

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,320
assurance or user acceptance testing to

00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,550
the more technical tickets and the

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,160
developer will actually take the time

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,630
and write very clear acceptance criteria

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,399
which is part of our process but then it

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,440
helps the project manager go through

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,389
step by step and sometimes you have to

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,730
open up Firebug and actually look at CSS

00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:40,829
and just starting to repetitively look

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,870
at CSS or whatever the structure is

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,610
starts to you gains more familiar and

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,430
you kind of know what to start looking

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,320
for yeah exactly so build confidence

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,820
build your knowledge at the same time

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,760
don't be afraid to kind of jump into

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,250
this stuff so on the other side of this

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,560
if you want to go from being a developer

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,029
to a technical project manager you know

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,589
the tech part there's kind of a

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,820
different post of skills that you're

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,110
going to have to start learning if

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,600
you've never done project management

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,579
before the first one of these is there's

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,860
going to be a really big shift in what

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,199
your workday looks like you need to stop

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,150
thinking about the code that will solve

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,610
the problem and you not need to start

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:20,339
thinking about the person who knows the

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,530
code that will solve the problem so stop

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,569
thinking about how and start thinking

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,790
about what you need to keep a catalog in

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,650
your head of this person is really good

00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,540
at the front end like this person knows

00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,410
you know how to set up these really

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,090
awesome like views and give them the

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,400
tasks accordingly to what needs to be

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,049
done so delegate you've got to learn to

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,460
start delegating instead of being

00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,760
tempted to get in there and be like I

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,440
know how to do this I can

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,970
some five minutes we'll fix it give it

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,850
to a developer it may take them 15

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,160
minutes to do it but they'll get faster

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,050
and faster at it so always delegate get

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,140
out of the code but I say that with a

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,330
caveat if you get too far out of the

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,570
code and the technology starts passing

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,310
you by that T&T p.m. is going to start

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,680
shrinking and your ability to really

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,480
kind of manage and help your developers

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,280
and kind of work with them as a team you

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,440
start losing a language you start kind

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,480
of losing you lose the plot a little bit

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,400
about what's going on so be there to

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,330
test and sort of always still be able to

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,820
debug and and know what's happening the

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,770
other two parts on here around kind of

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,780
i'll talk a bit about empathy and

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,660
interpersonal skills I think these are

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,240
always presented as these you know

00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,770
hardwired characteristic like a person

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,940
is born empathetic and they're just

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,730
empathetic and they're going to be that

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,070
way I really disagree with this I think

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,070
this is a characteristic the people can

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:44,650
cultivate over time there was a study

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,690
that was done a few years ago by these

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,610
two researchers named kiddin Castano and

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,770
they looked at what happened when they

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,390
had people read these short bits of

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,340
fiction and kind of tested them on these

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,020
levels of empathy and something that

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,610
they found is being exposed to a lot of

00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,530
fiction writing so people who are very

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,480
different from them it started to shift

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,010
their perspective and like their ability

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,420
to be empathetic and their ability to

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,340
think from another person's perspective

00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,980
and so this might sound a little bit

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,050
wonky but if you want to learn empathy

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,540
start reading fiction books follow blogs

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,600
like is everyone familiar with humans of

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,130
New York yeah we have a link to it start

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,140
following things like that if you're

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,850
only surrounded by people that look like

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,880
you think like you walk like you talk

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,050
like you your ability to understand the

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,030
other perspectives that are out there

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,190
are just going to be limited by share

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,570
exposure so try to step outside of that

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,660
if you really want to cultivate these

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:37,450
characteristics the last piece on here

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,520
is verbal judo so there is a retired

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,650
police officer named George Thompson and

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,960
he's kind of written the book on verbal

00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,200
judo and verbal judo is the art of

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,130
de-escalating a violent situation

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,590
through kind of word

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,350
and like the way you stand we have some

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,940
links up on there as well he has big

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,640
long talks that you can read through and

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,710
you have to figure you know if somebody

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,450
who was in the NYPD was able to use

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,550
these tactics to stop someone who is

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,800
pointing a gun at them when you're on

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,330
the phone with an angry client these

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:13,300
tactics can probably work just as well

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,830
all right so some really specific

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,110
challenges that you're going to run into

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,120
if you're coming from the developer role

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,130
into a technical project management role

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,200
the first thing is you're probably

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,420
really used to communicating technically

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,190
all the time you're not just going to be

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,290
speaking to other developers so you need

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,440
to explain things to clients the best

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:34,600
tack for doing this is to use analogies

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,700
like sit down and think about okay if I

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,410
want to explain cookies to a client how

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,600
can I use a real-world example of

00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,410
something that they're familiar with

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,120
that's going to help them really

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,940
conceptualize it and understand it

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,660
better another thing you need to get

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,550
used to is documenting everything every

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,290
conversation you have every agreement

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,620
that goes on you need to document it

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,820
start building like a secondary brain

00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,380
and you can do this through kind of

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,420
emails you can do it through your

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,580
project management apps on all this

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,290
other stuff but you always want to have

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,030
that secondary brain kind of running

00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,500
because you can go back and you can

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,970
reference it you may think you're going

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,880
to remember that conversation that you

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,230
had in like another week promise me with

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,620
everything that goes on these projects

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,840
you definitely not

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,660
because for like one of the tricky

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,950
things as that as you will become a

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,850
project manager from being in dev is

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,620
that you're going to sell a lot of time

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:29,400
on the phone and clients well

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,470
accidentally and maybe not intentionally

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,850
twist things around so one of the most

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,790
skillful things you can do is once you

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,590
get off the phone hang up and send a

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,240
reverse confirmation email like based on

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,410
our understanding of our conversation we

00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,880
are going to action this by this

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,370
timeline and you're responsible for

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,900
getting me content by that date you know

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,130
and you can you don't even have to ask

00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,780
for their confirmation you can say this

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,890
is a confirmation of the conversation we

00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,179
had and if they don't think it's right

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,059
there going to reply right away and say

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,679
no you said tuesday not monday so having

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,380
those moments it's really tricky

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,140
sometimes to do that and what has really

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,460
been hard is just he's going to go into

00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,230
this but not booking meetings back to

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,570
back because you need that thinking time

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,250
right after is one thing that's

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,870
different from being in developer to

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,820
bring an tbm is that you're going to

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,170
have multiple competing priorities and

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,470
it's all going to be happening at once

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,450
yep usually I like to say you want to

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:23,010
keep your calendar where you are about

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:24,270
30 70 or 40 60 of meetings to like the

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,580
follow-up work that needs to be done

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,590
every half hour meeting you have is

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,320
going to generate anything from like

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,809
another 30 minutes of work to two hours

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,580
of work and so if you're like I'm just

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,170
gonna do meetings all day you're going

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,210
to be sitting around at about midnight

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,710
or so still trying to play catch-up for

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,210
everything that you told the clients

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,530
that you were going to do or you're

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,120
going to drop the ball on documenting

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,559
everything and in a month the clients

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
going to be really angry because that

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,679
call that you had a month ago where you

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,470
said you do this thing but nobody has

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,210
any evidence of what was actually said

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:57,780
is going to kind of come back around to

00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:00,480
bite you pretty hard and the last thing

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,160
in here people coaching skills something

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,190
I like to recommend is doing a

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,990
compliment sandwich so let's say your

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,250
developer kind of messed up a little bit

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,190
you don't want to just go to them be

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:14,010
like come on really because they're

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,050
going to get defensive rightfully so the

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,000
better way to approach it is hey you

00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,110
know you're normally really good at

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
able to talk to clients and kind of

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,980
understanding what they need but they

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,540
needed it done by Monday and it wasn't

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,700
finished until Friday they're a little

00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,830
upset I know that you can do better I've

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,260
seen you do better than this so next

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,820
time around let's keep it on track and

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,740
that's an example of really doing you

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,790
want to give a compliment the bad news

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,440
you want to give them I'm going to

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,210
compliment after and it'll help them

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,790
really hear it and be more accepting of

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,790
it so compliment sandwiches for everyone

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:53,310
okay so being it TPM is hard writing

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,810
code is hard managing people is hard so

00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,310
we're going to put it all together and

00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,380
now we're going to share some more tips

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,390
and tricks and best practices and being

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,140
how you can be a rock star technical

00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:07,920
project manager so we have some quick

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,350
tips here up first off you're going to

00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,630
live an email land and this is a tip for

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,190
everybody but it's whether you're a zero

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,160
in boxer or not we highly recommend

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,140
clearing your inbox by end of day before

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,300
you go to sleep makes for a fresher

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,100
morning and you'll also have a clearer

00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,100
picture on what your priorities are

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:33,380
thanks someone's managing the backdrop

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,029
so you also want to understand your

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,740
priorities and this means like

00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,390
understanding what can be pushed and

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,820
what can't because some things that can

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,649
actually be pushed and I know we always

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,419
try to stick to our regimen to timeline

00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:46,039
and schedule but the reality is when you

00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:48,760
have competing things it's important to

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,960
know what can actually be moved around

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,789
another thing that we mentioned here is

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,750
we've said this before but stay close to

00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:58,010
the code and that means staying up on

00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,870
technology and processes if you're not

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,820
working if you're working as a technical

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,559
project manager already and you haven't

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,570
touched da maybe it's something it's

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,250
time to go and play around with if you

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,880
fall behind it becomes harder and harder

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,590
to help your team won that one of our

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,389
tpms at work brought up when I asked him

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:17,000
to look at this was really important in

00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:19,669
its own your mistakes and own your

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,740
team's mistakes if one falls you all

00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:23,389
fall and the most important thing about

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,149
learning from mistakes is the learning

00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:28,789
part and so hey to mess up and we all

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,830
will and clients can totally see through

00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:32,809
when you're like why I don't know what

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,700
happened right so if you can take

00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,080
accountability for the mistake and work

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,850
together as a team and learn from it

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,889
build a process around it you become a

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,690
stronger manager yeah and this really

00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:43,850
helps kind of building trust with your

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,289
end client because they don't understand

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,029
the technical side of this and what

00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,669
you're doing and they're just giving you

00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:51,049
a bunch of money and trusting that you

00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:52,490
are going to deliver on what you said

00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,870
you did even though they don't really

00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,820
have visibility and they may not

00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,130
completely get it so being able to tell

00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,419
them like hey this is what happened you

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,700
know we learn from it we're not going to

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:03,769
do it again it starts to establish trust

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,090
it establishes a sense of like we're

00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,470
kind of all in this together and we're

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,429
all working together and we're all going

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,360
to be super honest with each other and

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,220
another thing I've noticed especially

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,710
around the people that I work with is

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,120
the tpms that really shine is they again

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,279
they have really good abilities to

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,659
communicate non technically but even

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,269
more so importantly to the team as

00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:24,710
they're available they sometimes as a

00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,539
developer you would usually go dark

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,649
maybe we have a team members at pay I

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:29,630
don't take meetings your calls on

00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:31,399
fridays i need heads down time well that

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,960
doesn't happen as a TPM anymore and it's

00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:34,250
really really really important to be

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,230
available to your team

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,180
you may have team members and our night

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,540
owls and they work really constructively

00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:43,370
at night and even though yes we

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,350
encourage you to turn it off as a TPM

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,350
the more connected that you can stay

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,630
with the project and the team the closer

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,370
you can keep an eye on things and if

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,900
even if you're like on slack late night

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,910
and you notice your team members online

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,230
just saying hey like hey how's it going

00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,490
and you would be surprised that

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,500
sometimes they're really stressed out

00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,090
because they're working on something and

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,320
just a little friendly hello they're

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,180
like man I'm really cranking on this

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,550
code or having a problem are you around

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,260
yeah you know taking five or ten minutes

00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,850
out of your evening to help unblock a

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,980
developer who's chosen because it's

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,750
quiet time to think at night makes him

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,300
or her feel really support it and they

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,980
can keep the momentum it will railroad

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,230
your life a little bit from going into a

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,760
developer into a TPM roll your life will

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,650
change you will have some lifestyle

00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,810
flexibility around some of the things

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,330
because it may be quiet at times take

00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:33,290
advantage of the quiet times because it

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,700
very is a noisy role yeah okay couple

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,530
more quick tips this might be soaked not

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,980
so quick but we got some more tips here

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,420
so another thing is estimating is really

00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,220
hard and it doesn't matter who you are

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,960
but as a technical p.m. that will be put

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,750
on your shoulders a lot to actually

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,840
estimate things so the first thing about

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,760
estimating is that you know whether

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,260
you're close or not to the project you

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,610
always want to really involve the key

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,470
developer the person who's going to be

00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,870
executing the solution so they can have

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,920
buy into what that solution is now

00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,100
they're probably going to give you an

00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:08,180
estimate of time or money or hours

00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:10,100
double triple triple it drupa drupa so

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,900
you have to take into account that if

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,240
you were someone that can do this and

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,560
let's say a task in four hours most

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,960
likely your development team you think

00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,820
12 hours it's crazy I can't even believe

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,560
they'll need that time but the time that

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,200
it takes to talk to them about the issue

00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:27,020
to walk through the solution to execute

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,999
to test to implement the changes to send

00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,509
to the client all the sudden that time

00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,509
it's eaten up

00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,600
yeah all the windows are going to open

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,450
up the microphones are all going to

00:28:39,600 --> 00:29:00,450
explode sucked outside under the street

00:28:42,450 --> 00:29:02,370
I do not know what's happening God is it

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,630
coming back you're like that monster

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,170
that might be under the stage is just

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,820
gonna recipe missed us okay so and no

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,530
one to ask for help I mean this is a

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,780
really important one as a non technical

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,180
person coming into this role it's really

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,420
it's important to create time in your

00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,830
calentura to actually get some help and

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:22,920
this is also another one is to be humble

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,270
and curious it's really important for a

00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,550
non technical person as you're learning

00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,960
to ask strategic questions and sometimes

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,030
what you don't know is what you don't

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,640
know so it's hard to know what to ask

00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,200
but being curious and saying you know

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,450
would you take five minutes to help me

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,730
understand this and then writing it down

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,250
like verbatim and then going back and

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:44,040
say based on my understanding is this

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,170
what this means and then because things

00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,760
are so fast in this world it's often

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,080
skillful to find some time and your

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,700
evenings and weekends to review your

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,380
notes and come up with more thoughtful

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,660
questions to do more of that searching

00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,480
and that's really going to help deepen

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,580
your understanding and of course always

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,050
know when to turn it off I think the big

00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,270
thing is that you'll bring the best to

00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,040
your table when you do turn it off you

00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,420
will have a lot of noise it's kind of a

00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,950
contradiction to what I just said about

00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,870
being available but there is an element

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,370
of actually being able to just take a

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,580
phone call versus being fully on your

00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:17,250
computer and this slide has been

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,050
completely wiped it goes it goes okay so

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,520
we have three things I'm very excited

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,550
about this slide because I did a lot of

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:27,500
quick tips and it wasn't quick at all so

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:29,750
the first off supposed to go on a click

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,750
ah I see what you've done you got sneaky

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,700
with the absolute trust your gut so the

00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,290
first thing is your gut will always be

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,640
right doesn't matter if your technical

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,170
are non-technical if you think your

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,490
developer is going to go on my own

00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,140
Friday and we're not going to meet that

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,460
deadline for Tuesday trust your gut and

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,500
talk to them on Thursday evening and

00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,030
saying my guts telling me that you might

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,760
not be available like you think you are

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,170
tomorrow is that actually the case

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,730
because it's okay if you're not now

00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,780
figure it out but let's talk about it

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,580
now because it's going to become really

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,140
hard on Tuesday morning who's monday is

00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,700
a holiday or whatever you know cuz your

00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:03,740
gut is going to be right so follow that

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:06,170
intuition another one is that get to

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,850
know people like really get to know read

00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,980
people and this getting to know reading

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:13,250
people comes from reading your

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,320
developers reading your clients reading

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,360
the other managers and this is where if

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,760
you're a distributed team turn on your

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,880
video watch their body language watch

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,770
them watch themselves yeah always like

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,480
it's best to always try and have like

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,370
face-to-face meetings with your clients

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,110
being a disembodied voice I mean if you

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,970
just heard our voices over these

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,220
speakers right now in the room with

00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:36,200
slides going it would be a lot less

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,640
engaging you'd feel like there were kind

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,580
of robots going and it might be a little

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,500
bit creepy in terms of being able to

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,650
kind of read people this goes back to

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,600
this I believe is a skill that you can

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,000
develop start getting into the habit of

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,140
when you are talking to people don't

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,810
just think about the next thing that

00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,790
you're going to say you know watch their

00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:58,340
face watch their body language are they

00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:00,290
kind of tapping a little bit are they

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,180
kind of pitching up their voice and seem

00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,710
like they're a bit tense watch people

00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,630
when you're out like really start

00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,400
cultivating and learning how to read

00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:10,370
other people's body language you can get

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,950
really good at this and just a last

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,110
thing on that is that often sometimes

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,520
people drop balls not because they're

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,170
stressed out at work but because they're

00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,220
stressed out at home and there's

00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,100
something going on in their personal

00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,080
life and it's not their responsibility

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,730
or their obligation to tell you what's

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,260
happening in their personal life but

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,080
they could be potentially dropping a lot

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,670
of balls so before coming to any

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,620
concrete conclusions as to why things

00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,840
are wrapped up talk to them ask them

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,940
questions how you doing everything you

00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,860
know it's just it's just a little bit of

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,050
a friendly human touch to things really

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,370
helps people you can relate to them and

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,840
then help them work through their stuff

00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,160
say okay you need another week I'll go

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,960
find another week you know and that's

00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,720
your job is to go on your warrior path

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,760
to get more time or money and the last

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,620
thing is about balance and balance is

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,360
not lifework balance I'm talking about

00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,130
the balance of understanding how to

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,020
balance the client's needs with the

00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,240
developer skill set and make that magic

00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,640
happen and that's a really really key

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,950
thing that I learned from Ricky is that

00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,360
what he does all day is magic because

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,070
he's literally figuring out what the

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,510
client wants pairing with a development

00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,950
team and then making it all happen and

00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:16,750
the client and the developer robocopy

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:19,060
cool so a lot of this stuff has been

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,650
high level of like how you can learn

00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,510
these things the things that you need to

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,580
learn and we went over a little bit

00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,230
about like day in the life but we want

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,480
to kind of get into the weeds of some of

00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,220
this stuff what are these specific tasks

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,750
and like types of work that you're going

00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,780
to have to do when you're working as a

00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,220
technical project manager so the first

00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,480
one is creating tasks while you're going

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,730
to create documentation you're going to

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,020
help lead your team through all the

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,550
things most likely with tasks

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,160
and we can't ask out how to fix this

00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:48,520
reverb but first thing is I mean it's

00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,520
fairly straightforward

00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:21,279
prepare for a loud noise everyone Thanks

00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,289
so we think so we think so yes

00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:25,569
understanding the problem co-create the

00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:27,250
solution right testing criteria to

00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:30,129
define done because that's documentation

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,200
it defines in non-technical terms you're

00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:35,139
non-technical right your writing skills

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,970
and then defining the estimate and then

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,339
the most important part of actually

00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,559
sending off a person to do a task is to

00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:42,940
check in on them if they have an eight

00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,649
hour task that's going to take them all

00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,879
day ask them to do an hour and then come

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,990
back and check in with you so you can

00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:51,369
make sure they're going on the right

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:52,960
direction so if we're looking at we use

00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:55,210
a lot of user stories because we're

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,829
trying to blend our clients with our

00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,180
team members of everybody to be on the

00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:00,009
same page so we use a lot of user

00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,559
stories for functionality testing and

00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:04,450
humans are very into narratives they can

00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,880
relate and they can understand to user

00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,829
stories so in addition not only to user

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,589
stories is that again these narratives

00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:13,180
or these stories you're able to relate

00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:15,579
and you're able to kind of figure out

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,440
what the client wants and ultimately

00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:19,569
deliver on that yeah and this goes

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,130
beyond just like trying to break out

00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:24,849
tasks by putting them in the framework

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,380
of like a story if you are talking to

00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:28,750
your clients a good way to preface

00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,400
things is like okay tell me the story of

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,529
your problem if you're talking to your

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,119
developer like tell me the story of the

00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:35,559
issue that you're having right now it

00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:39,900
gives people a good frame to start kind

00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:42,759
of talking to you about it all right so

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,559
estimation this is one of those things

00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:46,089
there's no calculator that's out there

00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,220
where you can input the task that needs

00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:49,720
to be done and get an output of hours

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,150
required because there are so many

00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,650
individual factors that go into it so

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,140
the unfortunate thing about it is you

00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,670
just have to fumble your way through it

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,339
sometimes you're going to have really

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,319
bad estimations when you start out if

00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:04,779
you're a developer this is going to be a

00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:06,279
lot easier for you because you've done

00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:08,799
it you know it you have all the

00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:10,329
experiences going on in there if you're

00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,799
not technical and you're getting into

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:14,619
this for the first time you're going to

00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:17,079
mess up a lot it's okay we forgive you a

00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:18,060
way to kind of get around this is every

00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,480
time you have to start

00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,490
estimating how get your develop get a

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,750
technical person involved and ask them

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,640
like what do you think this is going to

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,530
take and then you can start to learn

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,270
like the parameters of how long

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,270
different types of tasks can take

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:44,340
starting to get a little like anxious

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:46,020
that it's going to rise up again no okay

00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,340
if I just hold on to this for the rest

00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,740
of the time I think we're going to be

00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,240
okay these might be ungrounded so I'm

00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,950
just going to grip on to this for dear

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,840
life all right okay so you're going to

00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,750
have a tool belt that you need to get

00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,550
together beyond having a laptop and an

00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,920
internet connection there are some

00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,050
really specific tools and like sweets of

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,980
tools you have to start looking at the

00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,440
first of these is of course

00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,180
communication tools we talked a little

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,980
bit about the need to be able to be

00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,260
face-to-face there are a lot of

00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,980
different ways you can do this slack

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:23,070
join the gotomeeting skype for business

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:26,010
zoom using google hangouts pick one and

00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:28,200
standardize it and like just go with

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:31,290
that another thing you're going to have

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,910
to look at our development methodologies

00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,670
you've probably heard of things like

00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,950
agile and waterfall and we could do an

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,750
entire session on either or both of

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:43,320
those but the quick way to think about

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:45,390
these is any project where there's a lot

00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,040
of lay of the land that's unknown and

00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,380
you're kind of going to be exploring

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,180
while you're doing development it needs

00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,160
to be agile because you're going to have

00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,170
to build kind of the skeleton or the

00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,360
ghost of the Minimum Viable Product

00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,890
evaluate it before you keep moving on

00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,260
and this is why you're going to kind of

00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,820
be re-evaluating and reiterating and

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,770
kind of changing your direction as

00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,390
you're building the project out if

00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,640
you're doing something that's more like

00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,380
brochure wear and you have the same kind

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,660
of modules that you're putting it every

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,100
time it's the same basic work and maybe

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,630
it's just like the content in the field

00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,840
it's a little bit different it's an

00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,670
iterative process it can be done over

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,220
and over again in pretty much the same

00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,620
way that's going to be waterfall and it

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,000
just depends on like what the end

00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,810
product is that you're going to be

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,810
building out and

00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,740
outside of that you should be looking at

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,120
project management kind of tools that

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,410
are out there there are so many

00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,660
different types of software and ways to

00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,940
do this from like sticky notes to

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,130
something like JIRA and they exist on

00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,260
kind of this spectrum on one hand you

00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,370
have something like base camp where you

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,260
know it's really pretty and it's got

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,240
this nice UI but you can't change

00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,530
anything around at all so it's very

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,820
rigid and you're stuck and what it can

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,730
do but if you don't want to have to

00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:00,280
think about building like managing the

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,920
project project of getting your project

00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,720
management tools working then you could

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,670
go with something like that on the other

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,680
end of the spectrum you have things that

00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:13,930
are so customizable that you need like a

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,490
specialist person to be able to build it

00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:20,140
out so you can start using it I'm

00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:22,360
looking at you JIRA and we'll have like

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,430
kind of a there's a sauna there's JIRA

00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,440
there's base camp there's right there's

00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,480
like teamwork pivotal tracker read mine

00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,910
there's so much out there and my

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,320
recommendation is to just evaluate them

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,480
on your own they usually have free

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,520
trials go sign up see what it looks like

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,070
build like a little fakie project in

00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,130
there try to port things in and see how

00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,360
it feels to you and how it works the

00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,710
other thing that you need we've talked a

00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,030
little bit about building out that kind

00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,540
of secondary brain that you're going to

00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:52,030
need to have you may also want to put

00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,340
automated reminders in when you send an

00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,380
email to your client and you say i am

00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,170
going to follow up with you on this

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,150
thing in two weeks at the moment that

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,160
you do that set a reminder for yourself

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,650
you can use things like email tracking

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,280
software you can use google calendar and

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,740
what i try to do is to go in there and

00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,600
have a specific block of time in the day

00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,340
where all of my reminders are going to

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,050
start flooding in and i just set aside

00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,000
time then and my phone will start

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,470
ringing and I'm like okay two weeks ago

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,510
I promised this eight days ago I

00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,830
promised this and on and on and on and

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,600
you can just start banging it out and

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,180
your clients will think that you have

00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,830
the most amazing memory on earth

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,650
surprise you just use automated

00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:35,020
reminders and the last little bit in

00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,790
here is testing we've talked about kind

00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,230
of when you're estimating you need to

00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,180
put a lot of time in there to be able to

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:45,800
test and then to also do

00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,500
visions this is again kind of a talk in

00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,470
and of itself when we're thinking about

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:53,390
what testing looks like on the left hand

00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,720
side of this V you can see kind of the

00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,040
process of getting contract in place

00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,450
doing all these like getting all these

00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,010
different pieces together and defining

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,540
them what they are run through the

00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:05,329
coding and then going back through and

00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,980
testing all of them unit testing is a

00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,079
lot smaller and more at a granule level

00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,400
once you've unit tested you want to look

00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:12,440
at all these parts that you know

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,390
function individually and independently

00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,430
and make sure that they all work kind of

00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,170
together and then from there you want to

00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,180
say all right well it worked on my local

00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:24,710
machine how does it work on this other

00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:27,980
server and then there's also the

00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:30,319
acceptance testing that's in here this

00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,380
should be a much much much bigger square

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,490
because it's a really huge category

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,170
there are so many different types of

00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,079
accept like user acceptance tests that

00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:42,410
you can do does it scale can it handle

00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,970
like really big stress there's I can

00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,369
actually put in a really really good

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:49,010
stack overflow article that I found on

00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:50,990
this where I pulled this image from and

00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,750
it's actually the second answer on there

00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,849
don't trust the top one and that can

00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,200
kind of go deeper into it like doing

00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:59,780
testing and all the tools that are out

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,760
there is a pretty big rabbit hole that

00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,140
we could start going into but we just

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,510
kind of wanted to give you a little

00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,440
overview of what that can look like and

00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,200
what you're going to have to start

00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:13,579
learning and then the final thing on

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,119
here this job is stressful you are going

00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:19,940
to be kind of working as a firefighter

00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:24,950
the best laid plans of mice and project

00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:26,960
managers almost always go awry so you're

00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:29,270
going to have really intense client

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,650
situations adrenaline is going to get

00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,859
really high people are going to get

00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,950
frustrated you can't you don't have that

00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:38,900
luxury in this role budget is going to

00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,220
change timeline is going to change scope

00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,770
is going to change whatever you thought

00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:45,260
you were doing two months ago it may not

00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:50,359
be valid anymore in small and in large

00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:52,339
ways you also want to employ magic words

00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,900
and I don't mean this in some cynical

00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,330
way of you need to say these words to

00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,430
make it

00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:59,580
seem like you care like you should care

00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:03,810
you should say things like I understand

00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:05,580
I can see this thing what you're saying

00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,350
repeating it back and saying is this

00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,800
what you're telling me I want to make

00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:14,670
sure like be empathetic be understanding

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,340
and above all be calm people can get

00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:21,150
really hyped up and really frustrated

00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:24,090
but in the end of the day no nobody's

00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:26,130
going to die it's just a website I know

00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:29,370
the people's like reputations and their

00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:32,940
careers can feel kind of threatened but

00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:34,830
it is just a website and if you can

00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,900
remain the calm one because it's really

00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,330
tempting when somebody is yelling at you

00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,460
your adrenaline starts to go up to and

00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:45,090
you're like oh yelling now allama to

00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,070
yell try to be the calm one if you can

00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,470
be calm in this situation you're going

00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:51,630
to be able to herd these cats in a

00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,700
superhero way and make sure everybody

00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,590
stays together and everybody stays calm

00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,790
and even in the tense moments you'll be

00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,740
able to kind of work together on this

00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:03,600
project do you have anything else to add

00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,280
no I just think again taking away the

00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,560
kindling and matches prevents you from

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,230
fighting fires as best as possible which

00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,150
again that for technical folks writing

00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,800
good documentation that humans can

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,290
understand and maybe even physically

00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,550
sign off on to create checklists like if

00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,810
you have a pre-launch checklist that

00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,000
goes through all of the things you need

00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,920
to do before you launch then you can set

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,600
it and forget it and the more systems as

00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,520
a technical project manager that you

00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,740
know where people tend to fall in those

00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,060
holes if you can try to figure out where

00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,860
those holes are and prevent them from

00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:36,900
even stepping in them saves yourself a

00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:38,940
lot of time yep and that is all we have

00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,060
for you now and we are happy to take on

00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:45,780
questions Jason have you been watching

00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:50,930
the twitter feed okay well we can just

00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,930
take your questions now thank God

00:44:52,730 --> 00:45:00,710
hashtag Drupal TPM as soon as I took it

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,230
out of this and stopped coming

00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:13,490
eventually I figured it out

00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:17,869
oh do we have uh I have a camera up here

00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:25,700
if we could so do we have any other

00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:28,369
questions yeah that's a great thing it's

00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,780
like what does success look like if you

00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,730
want to take that I don't know if you

00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,710
ever know that you've made it there's

00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:36,920
there's I mean you're you're making

00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:39,200
money off of it you feel your your

00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,600
ability in your flow to kind of handle

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,790
tense situations without letting it get

00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,590
to you is one of them being able to kind

00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,109
of direct the traffic is where you know

00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:50,060
you start to made it but I think all of

00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:52,010
us have some level of imposter syndrome

00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,890
I'm constantly sitting there I'm like

00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:56,060
they're gonna figure it out one day one

00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,550
day they're going to wake up and the jig

00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,080
is going to be up yeah and i would say

00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,300
defining what success looks like is

00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,570
finding a good mentor who can help what

00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:07,760
that path looks like and there comes a

00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,530
point in time like I came from a

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,119
marketing background and what i would do

00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,980
is road right the scope of work and i

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,810
would have the developer go in and edit

00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,430
it and not just edit it but like google

00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,619
like comment on it so i can see where

00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:20,780
the changes were and the thing was is I

00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:23,540
realized I was my estimate source now

00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,090
more close to accurate my scope of works

00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,670
are deeper technically I might not be

00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,380
able to write up exactly everything but

00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,880
i can write a good paragraph and at

00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,730
least write it in non-technical terms

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,050
and what I realized is when other people

00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,730
I said well I'm not technical they're

00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:39,500
like but you just wrote a scope of work

00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:42,290
for the three thousand our project and I

00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,490
barely edited it and I was like oh right

00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:47,300
and you wrote all of the infrastructure

00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:48,890
oh so okay all right and it's actually a

00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:54,369
place where you have people around you

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:54,369
that validate so yeah

00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,970
yeah like the more you know the less you

00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,050
know right the more you know you go oh

00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,420
my goodness there's so much more to

00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:19,030
learn right and if you could stay humble

00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:21,430
and stay curious and to know that a

00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,470
really good technical project manager is

00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:25,510
one that can anticipate what's going to

00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:27,220
happen and help redirect yeah and I

00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,250
think curiosity is also like a really

00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,260
big thing of this the best developers I

00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,180
have ever seen are the developers that

00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,099
are curious something is broken

00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,829
something is going wrong and they don't

00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:40,750
panic and go I did all the steps it's

00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:43,500
supposed to work like this stupid

00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:46,510
computer they look at it and they say

00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,950
interesting and if you can start to

00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,750
develop that kind of attitude and

00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,550
approach to it remember it is just a

00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,290
website and it is kind of interesting

00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,790
when things break and start kind of

00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,380
freaking out I mean it's not as

00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,410
interesting when you know you need to

00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,030
have it fixed within 12 hours but if you

00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,829
can remain curious it'll help you stay a

00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,510
lot less stressed about it and you know

00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:17,339
it's nice to have a curious attitude

00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:17,339
around the world yes yes okay

00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:27,060
yeah and so this is part of the the kind

00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,420
of acceptance testing in there that then

00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,740
that's why I was saying this is a huge

00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,390
category outside of the things that you

00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,070
can do with just like automating like

00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:38,340
acceptance testing part of that is like

00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:40,350
user experience testing is I would put

00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,940
it in that kind of category and it's

00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,850
like that's why I say that one's kind of

00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,320
so huge and so big because it's not just

00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:49,050
reliability or scalability or anything

00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:51,480
like that but how like getting it to an

00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:54,390
actual person and making sure that like

00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:59,430
they can use it and it functions kind of

00:48:54,390 --> 00:49:02,070
as needed so what we do we do a lot of

00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:04,020
web development obviously doing building

00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:06,000
lots of websites and we do user

00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:08,310
experience testing as early as possible

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,720
if we can do really research we'd like

00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,580
to help our clients make a data-driven

00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,830
decisions and if you're of a technical

00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,780
mindset going in and diving into the

00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:17,640
data and coming up as to why they should

00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,200
not have the CEOs face on the homepage

00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,210
and being able to go into that with a

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,619
lot of ammo from a technical side of

00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:27,770
things as well as from a user experience

00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:30,770
side of things I mean data is power so

00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,770
yes

00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:46,579
I always tried a big and build in wiggle

00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,839
room wiggle room is actually a technical

00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:49,579
person's best friend because they're

00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,619
very used to making things very concrete

00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:53,480
and solid and it's really important to

00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,339
build that wiggle room so on a 3000 our

00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,290
project a lot of it starts off with

00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:59,300
discovery we need to actually learn how

00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:00,619
do I know from a five-page RFP then I'm

00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,240
going to be able to actually deliver on

00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:04,280
the scope of work so having that

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,109
discovery but then it's taking also

00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,910
bite-size pieces because it's a huge

00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:10,190
undertaking to understand the scope of

00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,930
that size a project so you're like okay

00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,460
I'm going to talk about this specific

00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,660
thing and kind of dividing it up into

00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,790
pieces that you can then further

00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,859
breakdown and sometimes an often it

00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,810
means saying okay there's a huge solar

00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:22,640
component to this and they want all this

00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,829
craziness I'm going to talk to our solar

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,630
expert and ask for five bullet points on

00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:29,359
what we're like a paragraph from him and

00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:31,369
then okay they're really stuck on using

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,079
bootstrap they won't use anything else

00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:34,820
do we want to talk about whether we use

00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,920
SAS or less to build that you know like

00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,960
we can go into those conversations but

00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,430
discovery and building yourself in the

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,869
wiggle room especially if you're a

00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,670
really smart person that wants like

00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:45,500
figure out the solution you got to

00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:47,510
figure out the solution but the but then

00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,220
if or then what or you know all the

00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,720
different variations so that because the

00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,250
clients will inevitably come up with

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:57,829
things that weren't even thought of then

00:50:54,250 --> 00:51:00,020
so yeah scoping is a really hard thing

00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:04,480
to do in general and I do think it's

00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:07,480
just time lots of time lots of mistakes

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,480
yeah

00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:50,050
what everybody smile this is a wide

00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:55,660
angle lens thank you and if you want to

00:51:50,050 --> 00:52:00,640
find us we have another one here yet so

00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:03,700
if you go to the the like con site are

00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,869
will be up on there like we have a link

00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,850
to it you can go and you can provide

00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:09,070
feedback you'll also be able to get all

00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:11,980
of our slides and we will pop in our

00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:14,890
contact info and you can access our our

00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:17,859
drupal.org like usernames and profiles

00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:20,980
in there we're fine we'll post it using

00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:22,780
the TPM hashtag by end of day so you can

00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,040
keep an eye on and we also i have a

00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,359
booth at seven oh one with canopy

00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,010
studios you're welcome to pop by there

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,720
and or grab my card after and I can

connect you afterwards and I'll be

00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,250
chained to the pantheon booth giving

00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:35,740
demos all week so I will be super easy

00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,570
to find look for the bright yellow be

00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:40,450
like t-shirts that will all be wearing

00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:47,140
I'm sure you've seen them very

00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:51,220
flattering cool any other questions no

00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:53,890
no no um it's a very funny thing I am

00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:55,630
NOT I am NOT I I went to school to be an

00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:58,030
entrepreneur and I never thought i would

00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,500
do that and i never thought i'd work in

00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,359
technology i was the girl who didn't

00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,950
know how to get into my web site and was

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,390
like why do i have five different steps

00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:07,240
to upload an image in Drupal this thing

00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,920
so dumb I came I came out of the world

00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,420
of flash and I thought flash was like

00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,130
the coolest thing and then we had to be

00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,990
we did this content management system so

00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:18,330
all of my training is come from the

00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:21,270
school of hard knocks so likewise yeah

00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:23,770
and there were a lot of hard knocks but

00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:25,210
fortunately to the smart people and i

00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,220
gotta say the community has been

00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,900
absolutely a huge part of that

00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,300
experience and learning going to

00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,700
sessions i remember when i was going to

00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,840
sessions in 2008 i would go into the

00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,900
most technical thing and just write

00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,280
everything they would say down and then

00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,960
I would be like I don't understand any

00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,609
of this and then spend time with my

00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,490
community asking questions because

00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:47,320
drupal's got this weird language it

00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:50,200
seems so much different like we don't

00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,970
really build Gantt charts at work we

00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,440
really don't we keep thinking oh we

00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:58,390
should build this Gantt chart no we're

00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:01,510
just in or whatever process but yeah

00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:03,340
there is a really cool digital what does

00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:05,050
it call the digital Bureau and they

00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,119
offer a technical project management

00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,040
training and will be attending that this

00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,450
year so I think that anybody who wanted

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,010
to go outside of the dribble community

00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:13,900
get training I think it's called the

00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:15,310
digital Bureau summit and there's one

00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,440
specifically that's going to be in the

00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,640
links we have that in there as well for

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,810
the resources that we're going to share

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,990
with everybody later cool one last

00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,990
question

00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,360
one I can actually post up this really

00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,680
cool kind of world clock where you can

00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,600
find things that are within people's

00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,510
working hours I think you can add in

00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,730
like up to four or five time zones for

00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:49,500
time zone scheduling there is also like

00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,720
a little kind of widget that's in google

00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,550
calendar where you can select a bunch of

00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,410
different time zones to display and when

00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,880
you're scheduling a meeting you can see

00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:59,820
the time that it's going to be in every

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,590
single one of those time zones cultural

00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:03,150
barriers like again this is why it's

00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,310
really important to get people's faces

00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:07,830
on a hangout because if there's a

00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:10,590
barrier for language it's really really

00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,960
difficult to understand like a secondary

00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,030
or tertiary language if you can't see

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,470
somebody's face and you can't see the

00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:20,100
way that their hands are moving it gives

00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:21,570
you a lot of context cultural I don't

00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,250
know that can be a really thorny

00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:26,490
question maybe you don't talk about

00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:28,140
politics or religion or i would say that

00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:32,610
four time zones make it equally

00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:34,860
uncomfortable for everybody get equally

00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,420
uncomfortable so we're primarily west

00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,430
coast some of our East Coasters have to

00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,050
stay out to a torn you know seven or

00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:42,180

00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:47,610
one of our friends who lives in Turkey

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,350
and he is he's a wonderful developer

00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,630
he's super strong but sometimes his

00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:53,880
directness comes off really really

00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,380
strong with clients and honestly we're

00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,780
very honest with our clients to say hey

00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,820
he tends to be very direct he means it

00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:05,760
in the best form possible so to preface

00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,170
your clients so they know that or as de

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,000

00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,860
shield she's going to stand in between

00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,280
that and help be that barrier in that

00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,660
