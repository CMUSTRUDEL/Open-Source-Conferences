Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Ask Not What Open Source Can Do For Youâ€¦
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	The largest and most influential companies, non-profits, universities, and governments in the world are using open source to create value within their organizations. These organizations benefit from the use of open source software, but not all of them capitalize on the full value of embracing the communities that support open source. It's not enough to choose to use open source anymore: it is time for organizations to step into the center of the community to contribute, drive innovation, lead with practical requirements and assist in further developing the projects that are helping them to achieve their missions every day.

Open source involvement is not a purely altruistic proposition. Organizations who build contribution into the jobs of their digital teams are rewarded with tangible business benefits including greater return on investment (ROI) and lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for their software platforms.

Many organizations have blazed a trail to demonstrate what good open source citizenship should look like. In the Drupal community, we have remarkable examples to follow like NBC Universal, Pfizer, Redhat, the World Bank, Stanford, United Nations, and the White House.

This talk will center on the organizations who truly embrace open source, their leadership principles, their community practices and how they make open source part of their everyday work, culture, and mission. Anyone tasked with building performing software teams, making IT investments or leading technology change including CTO's and CIO's will learn:

How organizations of all sizes, budgets, and missions contribute to open source;

Barriers these companies have overcome to get involved and how they did it;

Concrete strategies for incorporating a culture of open source into your organization;

The positive impact open source involvement can have to IT investment;

How to get access to better talent by leveraging open source involvement.

alright so this talk is called ask not

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,330
what open source can do for you but what

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:14,280
you can do for open source my name is

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:18,000
Jeff Walpole on the CEO at phase two and

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,580
I'm going to be hopefully providing a

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,859
variety of perspectives for people who

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,010
are interested in how to make an open

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,619
source argument inside an enterprise but

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,779
also how to get more out of an open

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,059
source community so going to talk a lot

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:38,219
about engagement and participation in

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,140
this talk so the first thirst kind of

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,210
major theme i have is sort of the value

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,520
of engagement the first place to start

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,430
is understanding how do we value the

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,039
engagement of an organization in the

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,170
enterprise so here's an interesting

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,600
quote and i did a lot of research for

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,579
this talk and i tried to focus not just

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,820
on drupal but and open source

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,590
technologies and also at companies that

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,199
you would recognize right i think a lot

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,549
of us sort of tend to think of the the

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,290
companies that we work with here in the

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,760
drupal space and know the names and

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,920
those are the people that we think are

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,450
doing the most open source work but when

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,020
you really go out you look at Silicon

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,770
Valley Facebook Linkedin Google Apple

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,110
those are the companies who really power

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,729
open-source contribution and so this was

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,920
interesting this is a quote from the

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,240
Fate from the actual as almost a phase 2

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,390
from the Facebook blog in 2006 and it's

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,350
actually talking about the value of open

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,270
source to Facebook and if you guys read

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,200
anything in this sort of the the open

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,000
source media Matt sa who is a huge open

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,070
source advocate and writer writes for I

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,500
think he writes per ZDNet now but he's

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,680
been the CEO and CTO and CMO of a lot of

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,659
marketing companies this year he named

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,110
facebook as the most open source company

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,180
in the world and that's because so much

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,130
of what they do is contributed back to

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,530
open source and so much of what they

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,750
value in their code base comes from open

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,979
source it's a two-way street and it's

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,420
pretty interesting because you tend to

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:14,830
think of this as being not in the

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:17,470
Silicon Valley space but it really is so

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,360
I want to talk a lot about the promise

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,340
of open-source engagement for

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,500
enterprises and when I say enterprises

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,380
I'm talking about large organizations

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,950
either a fortune 1000 government

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,200
organization a large you know large

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,420
education system somebody who's got a

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,760
significant amount of size and scale to

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,160
apply to the problem of developing

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,989
software right and that's not because I

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,840
don't care about small and medium-sized

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,970
businesses or smaller nonprofits or or

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,769
community organizations I do and I think

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,630
they get a lot of growth and source but

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:51,519
the arguments for why they use it and

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,310
how they use it or entirely different

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,130
right so what I want to talk about today

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,470
is not about the choice between using

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,530
open source and not using open source I

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,299
think that argument has been won by the

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,819
open source community and Drupal is a

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:09,760
great example of that the the companies

00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:12,430
that trees put up today you can see you

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,380
know we've got significant argument to

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,690
be made that using open source is better

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,489
than commercial proprietary solutions in

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,459
many areas and content management is

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,780
certainly one of the leading areas what

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,640
I want to talk about today though is

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,370
actually a different take on that I want

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,019
to talk about the ways that

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,329
organizations actually find to increase

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,459
their engagement and participation in

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,799
open source communities and so that

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,299
distinction is an important one I'll

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,040
talk a little bit more about that in a

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:43,510
minute so there was a great study one of

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,160
the things I read the other day is I'm

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,370
the Linux Foundation came out with a

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,370
study in which they tried to value the

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,140
value of the Linux codebase right which

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,810
is a massive codebase that's been

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,329
developed an open sore in in the open

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,980
source world out in the open for many

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,750
many years and it's had many large

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,489
contributors on the enterprise side and

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,410
of course it's had you know tens of

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,920
thousands of individual contributors as

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:12,280
well they valued the the code base of

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,480
Linux at five billion dollars which is a

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,159
shocking number

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,870
and it's an interesting study and I

00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,989
recommend you download it and look at it

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,090
but it goes to demonstrate sort of we're

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,850
at this point now where it's not a

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,040
question of whether that code or that

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,380
software functionality could or should

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,880
be used as open source at five billion

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,260
dollars and all the code that's gone

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,419
into it how could it be anything else

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,100
right I mean who else is going to

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,050
contribute five billion dollars to an

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,570
operating system at this point right and

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,010
so it's an interesting idea to think

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,430
about the fact that we've actually gone

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,889
so far that we really are over the edge

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,990
into open source is now a dominating

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,720
force in software development that no

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,470
one can take back and I think the value

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,289
of its well proved so when I talked

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,760
about the difference between using

00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,169
participating contributing I'm using a

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,479
bunch of different words and I actually

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:07,780
have a distinct definition for each of

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,550
them so using to me is choosing to use

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,740
open source software instead of

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,260
commercial alternatives right and Drupal

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,270
is just one example you know Apache is a

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,400
great example right using choosing to

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,560
use apache or linux or anything else in

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,410
the lamp stack and there's you know

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,180
literally dozens of examples that's

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,190
different than participating what you

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,289
guys are doing here today by being a

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,150
triple con whether your sponsors or

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,820
speakers are just here to listen and

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,919
meet people that's a participating in

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,690
effort in the community right and

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,580
there's a distinction between using the

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,680
software and participating in the

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,240
community and for me just fitting the

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,039
community is going to meet ups or

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,200
speaking of meetups going to conferences

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,500
online engagement getting into the issue

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,910
cues talking to people working in groups

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,490
those types of things it's a two-way

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,580
sort of participatory social activity

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,830
and then the third category here is

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,260
contributed and contributing is perhaps

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,750
the most discussed with the least

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,820
understood form of engagement in open

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,280
source right it's actually adding to the

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,960
code base itself either fixing bugs

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,550
you're submitting patches you're

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,370
contributing software functionality

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,669
enhancements or documentation right and

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,410
so it's this act of actually giving and

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,630
then of course there's this interesting

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,249
hybrid or this interesting overlap of

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,049
financial

00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:28,019
patronage that occurs in open source as

00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:30,149
well and financial patronage is both the

00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,879
form of contributing like donations

00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,889
grants things like that but it's also a

00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,779
form of participating sponsoring this

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,559
conference right sponsoring a code

00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:41,999
sprint those are ways to pay for a

00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:43,739
participating activity right so

00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,969
financial patronage is this sort of

00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:46,859
reoccurring theme that I'm going to

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,079
bring up a couple times because it is

00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:52,319
also where Enterprise meets open source

00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:54,209
open source needs enterprises to be able

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,839
to have the financial resources in

00:06:54,209 --> 00:07:01,289
capital to deploy that into these

00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,669
communities to help them thrive so those

00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:05,610
are all examples of what I talked about

00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,469
I would say the general box just going

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,599
around all this for today is engagement

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:12,899
right so I think of this as engagement

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,909
and I think of all of these as

00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,249
components of an engagement strategy

00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:21,209
there isn't one strategy it made up of

00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:23,069
all these things so there are

00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,769
organizations out there and in many

00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:29,099
cases I think it's perfectly fine for an

00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:31,559
organization to use open source but not

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:33,929
be a larger participant in either the

00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,879
community of the project right and

00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:38,219
there's many examples of where that

00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,049
happens and not everybody can get

00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:42,269
involved not every Enterprise can get

00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:44,519
involved in every single project open

00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:46,439
source project that they use right you

00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,739
know how many of you you know contribute

00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,919
to Drupal for instance right now how

00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:55,739
many of you contributed Apache project

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,159
right or the Linux project for the my

00:07:55,739 --> 00:08:02,099
sequel project right so there there's

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,329
there's an infinite amount of open

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,919
source code out there that you could

00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,499
contribute to but there's a finite

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,479
amount of time and so people in in

00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:12,899
organizations are making these decisions

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,239
as to which projects contribute the most

00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,429
value to them in a given point time

00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:19,409
clearly people that come choose to come

00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:23,129
to Drupal can't find triple to be one of

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:25,379
those projects right so when you don't

00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:28,199
do that when you just use software it's

00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,419
not always bad but what it sometimes

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,590
leads to is you not being able to

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,320
realize the full game

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,900
of that of that value right so you might

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,820
get go download Drupal and actually see

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,010
some of the benefits of dribbles at CMS

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,330
but you might be missing out on a lot of

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,490
the ways that you can work with the

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,680
Drupal community or gain knowledge or

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:52,530
experience through participation in the

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:55,020
project itself so for one second i will

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,810
talk about why leading enterprises are

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,610
using open source and i really just do

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,560
me using the open source code now and

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,420
the reason I bring it up is like I said

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,310
earlier it's not that it's not that

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,100
small and medium-sized businesses or

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,990
educational institutions or or community

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,970
organizations aren't using it but they

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,590
have a different priority set right you

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,880
see these you see these bullets a lot

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,760
it's like why do people use open source

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,350
right and I think if you put three or

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,540
five or six bullets up there they

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,670
probably all be right the question is

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,650
when you're an enterprise which of these

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,870
matter more to you and so what you'll

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,060
notice is cost effectiveness is at the

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,300
bottom right and it's not because

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,090
enterprises don't value cost as a

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,250
determining criteria they do but they're

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,110
also in a competitive nature more

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,510
interested in things like speed to

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,790
market maximum flexibility of the code

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,020
base out sourced innovation and

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,490
development that they can get from the

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,620
community and of course cost

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,330
effectiveness but it's not really the

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,920
same equation they have a different set

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,930
of priorities that they bring to bear so

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,730
now as we wonder why they're actually

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,760
participating and I think in a lot of

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,490
cases you know one of the things that

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,380
you really don't see a lot is is an

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,330
argument for why participating you see

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,340
an argument for why using you see an

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,990
argument for why contributing but in the

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,490
Middle's is participating like why do we

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,590
all come to juba calm like why are we

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,450
here right sure the swag and the

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,550
t-shirts and the stickers are awesome

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,280
right and so are the parties but like

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,020
what's the value to an enterprise to be

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,090
participating in this and so I think

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,460
that's kind of the open question so the

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,990
number one thing I've heard and I did as

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,670
I said a lot of interviews I talked to a

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,780
lot of companies and I'll tell you a

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,060
little bit about who they are in a

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,860
minute but the number one thing I hear

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,360
over and over again is talent right it's

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,340
the most common reason that people

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,380
participate in the community and the

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,200
reason is it's not it's you know it's

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,690
kind of natural right this is a so

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,580
engagement social engagements tend to be

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,740
about connecting one person to another

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,990
and so the primary thing you'll hear is

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,050
recruiting right you if you talk to a

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,610
big business that's here you'll ask him

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,530
like hey why are you at drupalcon and

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,030
the answers are going to generally

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,890
revolve around something to do with

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,080
people talent is a number one thing

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,000
they're looking for great developers to

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,290
higher rate or they looking for project

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,270
managers that have experience in this

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,630
space or designers that not designed for

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:17,090
this platform but there's also a second

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,800
component here and certainly my company

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,870
and other companies that have been

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,190
recruiting from this community and

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,100
working this community for a long time

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,470
know that you also have to retain great

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,330
talent right it's not enough to just go

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,580
higher than you actually have to retain

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,560
them in the way that good developers in

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,710
particular are retained in this kind of

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,540
a space is you provide you provide great

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,610
environments for them right and those

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,070
environments are places in which there

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,570
and and they're empowered and enabled to

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,510
contribute if that's something that

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,830
motivates people you have to be able to

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,450
appeal to those interests right and

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,000
that's that's sort of the irony of this

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,550
whole thing is that talent is acquired

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,730
in the open in an open source community

00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,530
right but you also have to put your best

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,440
people out there and show their talent

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:06,410
off making them attractive to someone

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,450
else so there's an irony right which is

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,720
sort of like the openness baguettes

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,460
baguettes potentially you know someone

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,560
getting poached or taken from your

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,480
company so it's an interesting sort of

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,280
dichotomy that we live in we're all in

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,460
the open and it's all out there for good

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,610
or for bad right and then the other

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,500
piece of this is purpose right you know

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,080
if I you know if I went to hire a great

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,180
developer here you know out here in the

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,620
exhibit hall today and I walked up and I

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,300
said hey we're one of the biggest

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,250
companies in the world we make a ton of

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:43,790
money come work for us they'd be like I

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,200
don't care right but if I said hey you

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,460
know we're one of the largest

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,090
pharmaceutical companies in the world

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:52,400
solving solving cancer cancer treatment

00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,680
right or developing cancer drugs or

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,080
something and you're open source code is

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,310
contributing to the success of that

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,630
that's

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,340
totally different thing right that's an

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,010
intrinsic motivator for them they see

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,080
how what they do every day can

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,540
contribute to a larger purpose right and

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,520
that kind of connection between can

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,170
happen in open source we literally have

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,180
opportunities to see out in the open

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,589
where our code can contribute to a

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,690
greater good and it doesn't have to be

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,279
curing cancer it could be you know world

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,500
peace or world hunger or any of those

00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:24,870
other small things that most of us like

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:28,720
to pretend we're working on every day so

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:32,200
yeah so I mean for me it everything

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,180
comes back to office space eventually if

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,170
you've seen the movie and if you haven't

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,910
then I don't know why you'd come to

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,940
drupalcon but that's just a stuff that's

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,680
a whole separate issue but you know I

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,300
think another this is an interesting

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,460
quote this is from the co-founder of

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,750
github and of course there's huge open

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,570
source company and that's their whole

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,980
model is based upon that but one of the

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,779
things I really liked about what he

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,220
talked about is that is the job

00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,190
interview process because it reminded me

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,050
a lot of what happens at phase two it's

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,390
really cool when you don't have to ask

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,310
for a code sample or you know you know

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,380
the old show me a writing sample right

00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,660
well if someone's an open-source

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,970
developer or contributor it's all there

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,380
all their mistakes everything they've

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,150
done their good thinking they're good

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,950
interactions the issue queues are

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,690
littered with their behavior how they

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,490
interact with other people how they

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,170
treat other people it's all there it's

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,480
all part of the public record it's a

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,580
fantastic interview and recruiting tool

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,290
right so it's just an interesting way to

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,280
think about how that openness be gets

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,930
better information for an employer the

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,339
other aspect of this is learning right

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,010
when you flip it around you think about

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,280
well why do you send your people to add

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,910
ripple conference or something like that

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,320
one of the things that's really

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,380
interesting as you learns you talk to

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,180
people in IT departments and development

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,190
organizations inside large enterprises

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,480
and they say that one of the ways that

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,100
they learned how to do some of the

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,800
things they did is by participating in

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,440
open source so they actually get things

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,510
like software development practices they

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,700
brought a jelyn from being involved in

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,740
projects like this or they brought in

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,500
get because their developers learned how

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,480
to use get on the Drupal project or they

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,850
learn something about DevOps by coming

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,170
here

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,500
learning about cloud deployment

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,850
practices or continuous integration or

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,920
automation or something like that so the

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,509
sort of you get this sort of set of

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,360
learning that you couldn't get elsewhere

00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:23,269
and you're giving your developers and

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,550
your technical staff a chance to to you

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,860
know to learn new skills right it's a

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,660
very cost-effective way to do training

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,220
it's much cheaper than you know a

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,819
master's degree in software engineering

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,949
or sending someone out for a 35 thousand

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:38,720
dollar you know course that's you know

00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:41,110
very detailed right it's a more broad

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,060
based education it's a lot cheaper and

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,980
then there is this technology transfer

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,529
component to that that happens whether

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,000
we realize it or not like by coming to

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,190
these conferences and participating

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,290
online in open source communities your

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,480
your team is gaining exposure to new

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,610
technologies that they may or may not

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,230
admit came from there but that's where

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,850
they learned that cool new JavaScript

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,920
framework right they got it from

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,839
engaging in an open source project where

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,310
it was introduced right they didn't it

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,470
isn't just Google you know cool

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,970
JavaScript framework right they somebody

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,620
showed him that they learned that they

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,930
saw it in a code base somewhere right

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,970
and that's an important part of how this

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,189
works and then of course you're also

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,139
most if you're especially for technology

00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:23,300
company but even if you're not your

00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:25,339
technology your technology thinking is

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,769
then working back into the community

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:31,009
it's a two-way technology transfer right

00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:33,050
if your CDN company a bunch of CDN

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:34,610
companies here right like your

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,589
participation in the community makes

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,930
everyone else aware of that CDN and in

00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:42,050
some ways you're probably adding hooks

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,579
and connections to that code in you know

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,279
into the project that you're working on

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:49,100
and vice versa and so that exchange is

00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,589
incredibly important and then the other

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,110
part that's really interesting is that

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:56,779
is that you also get to see how other

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,329
people are innovating certain problems

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:02,420
right you get to witness innovation in

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:04,250
R&D in an open chamber and for an

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,980
enterprise that has very limited

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,689
resources you might not have the ability

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,400
to do research and development or

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,319
innovation around a certain piece of

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,020
functionality but if you can watch

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,959
someone else do it for free that's

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,040
pretty powerful right and and it really

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,180
helps you get

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,620
most out of your money there so let's

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,540
talk a little bit about why enterprises

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,950
are contributing to open source projects

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,050
right we all think of this as

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,240
contribution and just the term itself

00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,740
sounds like an altruistic activity you

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,660
do it because they tell you it's the

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,190
right thing to do particularly in

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,300
communities like this and the truth is

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,890
that while individuals may get

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,660
individual satisfaction from doing it or

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,580
people may feel good that they've done

00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,010
it there are actually very tangible

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,010
reasons why enterprises should be doing

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,840
this from a business perspective as well

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,850
and those are motives that are driving

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,440
them which are not necessarily bad they

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,640
could be considered ulterior but they're

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,020
still good for the project so you know

00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,420
one of the one of the most important

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,770
things is is wisdom of the crowd right

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:12,280
so if there is a if there's a common

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,540
problem that is out there that is not

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,940
necessarily something that your

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,830
organization needs to solve but is

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,690
something you need to get through you

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,910
can use the wisdom of the crowd to solve

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,650
that problem for you so there's this

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,560
integration that other people are going

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,750
to need why not watch as someone else

00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,520
innovates the solution to that and you

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,370
get to piggyback on it you get to stand

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,460
on the shoulders of giants right too

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,190
often in enclosed organizations large

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,200
enterprises you know too much money goes

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,270
to developing common problems that other

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,730
people are outside solving for you and

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,050
that's a very expensive proposition if

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,860
you can leverage what's already been

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:54,590
done the other one thats related to that

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,440
is is what I call force multiplier right

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,330
and force multiplier is an example of

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,850
when you know you might have a small

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,530
team of developers capable of building a

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,290
certain amount of code for you but if

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:09,380
you're capable of contributing that code

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,720
to a to a community and empowering

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,120
people to build on that code you're

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,520
actually extending your development

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,020
capability by allowing people out there

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,270
to write code for you and there are

00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,160
dozens well not dozens there's hundreds

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,320
or thousands of examples of where this

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,900
has been a successful acceleration

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,720
strategy for for enterprises and you

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,059
have to be savvy to do it

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,440
you requires that participation in the

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,030
community you can't just put it out

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,429
there and have it happen but when it

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,530
does work it's a flywheel that creates a

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:42,340
lot of a lot of energy for your

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,890
organization and and so you know the

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,960
thing I like to think about is you're

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,010
literally when you put it out there and

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,390
you're working with people in the right

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,510
way you're literally inviting people to

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,820
test repair improve maintain and

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:58,150
document your code along with you and

00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,039
you're not paying them think about it

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,140
for a minute right it's super important

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:04,000
like to imagine that you're getting

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,679
you're getting free work there right

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,880
there's something in it for them there's

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,100
something in it for you and it's a

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,360
mutual exchange it's not a bad thing

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,190
you're not taking advantage of anyone

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,890
but there are people that will extend

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,409
and carry that forward and as sim as

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,900
much as people who are used to this

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,520
model think of that as just natural

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,919
there are people in enterprises

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,780
particularly in financial areas or in

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,549
higher levels of executive functions

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,409
that might not realize that that

00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,690
capabilities available to them if they

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:35,080
make a small investment in participating

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,450
in a community so this is another quote

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,870
from from tom preston Werner as well

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,789
he's also sorry he's also he wrote this

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,960
close called open source almost

00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:46,120
everything and I thought it was really

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,610
great he gave me a lot of the insights

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,409
around some of these things but this one

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,970
was like in a good example like I mean

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,650
hit get up you know because they have

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,419
this great platform it's really easy for

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,370
them to do this they they have a

00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,350
technology called risque and they just

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,450
put it out and they said he said they

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,880
had 115 different developers outside the

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,620
company who are literally just extending

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,320
this functionality on a regular basis

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,250
and all they're doing is just sort of

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,490
shepherd in him a little bit they're

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,640
just 115 people operating code for him

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,730
unbelievable right

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,820
I talked to a friend of mine Dennis

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,410
Cooper who's open source needed paypal I

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,510
did some interviews with her about how

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,950
paypal does this and again these are big

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,680
technology companies right we're not

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,020
talking small fries here these guys have

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,290
released you know dozens of frameworks

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,000
they do a lot nodejs and they've

00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,190
released some selenium based testing

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,900
frameworks and some of the functionality

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,790
that they use like to get photos off

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,190
credit cards for payment entries and

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,020
stuff like that so this was actually a

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,700
project that they that they put out

00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,540
called release the kraken which I

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:55,680
thought was clever so so we flirt in

00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,420
here so there's another interesting

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,190
phenomenon that goes that goes behind

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,990
the scenes and this is something and

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,550
actually interviewed Drees for this

00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,520
presentation we talked quite a bit about

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,440
you know maybe below the surface what's

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,910
really happening right and when you

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,650
really get into a community you realize

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,720
one of the things I thought was most

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,610
interesting is when you really get to

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,940
know the people inside of a community

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:20,130
like drupal the the smart enterprises

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,740
are actually figuring out how they can

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,120
use those people to gain control and

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,070
influence over the direction of

00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,990
something that they care about right so

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:31,740
some of the examples that trees put up

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:33,720
this morning you know whether it's the

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,030
pattern lab you know component based

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,840
architecture you know photo based design

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:41,100
or trying to think what his other

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,090
initiatives were okay I'm drawing a

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,670
blank but initiatives like that right if

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,500
if you are an enterprise a very large

00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,090
enterprise that has a vested interest in

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,880
the success of one of those things you

00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,940
actually can pull strings within the

00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,680
community by knowing people and asking

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,810
them to move remove blockers from issue

00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,610
queues working with them to contribute

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,950
patches and then tapping them on the

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,050
shoulder and saying hey it's me can you

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,810
commit my patch right that stuff happens

00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:12,420
every day right it's not bad it's good

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,100
it's ways that the social interaction

00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,830
the social network of the community

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,290
actually moves people to the front of

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,450
the queue it clears blockers and it gets

00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,860
priority things done and if you're an

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,370
enterprise and you understand what your

00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,380
priorities are and how to get

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,880
there it's a really awesome way to make

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,880
sure that stuff is getting done for you

00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,180
there's also sort of a nefarious

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,200
strategy that's out there and I just

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,300
wanted to mention it because just

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,620
because I think it's kind of interesting

00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,980
and some of you read a little while ago

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,800
Tesla open source the lot of the code

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:47,020
that they use to to power their electric

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,150
cars right and people are like why on

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,320
earth would they do that right and part

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,410
of the reason you know the least the

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,760
stated reason was that you know they're

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,230
not really competing with other electric

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,900
car companies right there competing with

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:03,340
gas company or look sorry what do we

00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:05,350
call the other ones fuel oil internal

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,059
combustion thank you they're competing

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,250
with internal combustion engines right

00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:11,350
but also what's really interesting is

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,400
they know that they're so far along and

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,110
they're more advanced and more

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,780
sophisticated software that they're not

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,520
open sourcing that the sort of brand can

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,440
file software can just get dumped out

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,570
there and let other people work with it

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,220
and maintain it and they kind of lose a

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,270
competitive edge but there's no electric

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,860
car company that isn't going to have

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,600
that basic stuff anyway what they're

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,940
really doing is standardizing their way

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,530
of doing it while they're moving on and

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,600
working on the more advanced

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,580
functionality that is actually a

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,320
competitive differentiator right and

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,910
that's it's all it and I like to think

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,860
of it as the open-source equivalent of

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,420
price dumping right so they're just

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,670
literally taking this big piece and say

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,110
here here's all the commodity stuff you

00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,000
guys maintain it in the community with

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,010
us it's our stuff but you know we'll

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,750
give it away we'll be over here writing

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,309
the really advanced stuff right and so

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,910
that's actually a strategy believe it or

00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:59,470
not that Apple Amazon Google Netflix a

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,390
lot of these companies do this to each

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,880
other and open source and it's not that

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,710
everybody benefits but they also get the

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,010
advantage of sort of distracting the

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,330
competition a little bit and then of

00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,250
course there's the age-old sort of

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,870
marketing and brand awareness like like

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,390
I said earlier about the individual the

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,200
same thing applies to the enterprise so

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,330
everything that you do everything you

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,070
contribute the patches the thinking the

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,929
writing of the code the documentation

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,940
it's all public and when it's out there

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:26,980
public it's good for your brand right if

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,990
you're doing a good job now conversely

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,330
it can backfire if you're doing a bad

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,870
job but if you're doing a good job then

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,059
you can

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,640
actually send a signal to everyone that

00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:38,770
you are someone who cares about open

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,690
source you do great things in technology

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,400
and everyone it's evidence it's proof

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,190
that you're innovating and doing cool

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,780
stuff and that's all she really powerful

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,910
as a brand motivator it's good for

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,190
getting business you know the perfect

00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,230
example is the Drupal shops or a Drupal

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,690
shops and people here in this space

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,840
everybody relies on this um you know

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,670
last year on drupal.org they changed the

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,190
algorithm of how the marketplace was

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,650
sorted so that the the shops that were

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,300
making the most contributions would rise

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,770
to the top so we sort of created a

00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,980
leaderboard right to game and

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:14,559
incentivize contribution right that sort

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,290
of interplay between contribution and

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:23,500
brand awareness is fascinating and it

00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:24,580
works really well and open source so you

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,740
know the other thing and I thought this

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,030
was a good quote this was this is the VP

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,280
of systems and engineering or at least

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,870
used to be at Netflix and he was talking

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,040
a little bit about the signal that it

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,690
sends to your current potential

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,700
customers like if you're willing to

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,140
invest in open source like you're

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,429
definitely willing to invest in them

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,620
right because you see this sort of

00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,360
technology investment that's very public

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,650
and very you know altruistic on the

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,720
surface and it's a very important

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,480
message to your customer base like you

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,340
are a company that has this thinking for

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,600
the future you're setting plans you're

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,160
putting frameworks in place and

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,860
potentially you're willing to do the

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,559
same thing with them what that has to do

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:04,840
with seals I don't know but I got some

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:06,610
help from our designers so let's talk a

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,840
little bit about how enterprises engaged

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:12,520
right so there are some general patterns

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,980
and as I said before I think what you're

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,630
going to find is that you know your your

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,650
unique combination of these is really

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,809
important so 11 kind of one kind of

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,460
stance is like low participation in

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,110
there's organizations out there who just

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,700
kind of hang back there's a monitor and

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,170
learn approach their reading they're

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,059
engaging maybe they have drupal.org

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,410
accounts in our world or something like

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,360
that but they're just listening they're

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,340
taking it in there's other ones who are

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,200
approximate art nurse so they understand

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,960
that contributing and having involvement

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,159
in the communities

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,720
important but they don't necessarily

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,820
have the resources to do that themselves

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,010
so they're working with a partner like a

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,570
phase 2 or aqua plays this role for a

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,480
lot of people where they become sort of

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,159
a a proxy for contributions and for

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,289
issue to you wrangling and things like

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,320
that it's a perfectly valid strategy to

00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:58,279
hire a vendor to help you with that

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,370
there's like more high participation

00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:03,110
models and some of those include like

00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,520
self representation so you have a few

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,200
key people on your team that are very

00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,970
visible involved in the community and

00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,539
those become your go-to people you

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,799
channel everything for Drupal or for

00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:15,320
eclipse or something through a few

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,240
through key people right and then the

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,919
last one it is the most rare is the full

00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,960
integration which is you literally have

00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,330
a very visible presence you're probably

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,279
sponsoring events yourself you're hiring

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,630
from the community you're interacting

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,240
with the community you're contributing

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:31,010
the community you're like all in

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,520
everything in in in order to do that you

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,450
have to see the significant gain

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,309
strategically from the value of that

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,679
piece of software and again I want to

00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:41,659
emphasize like every Enterprise can't

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,549
interact with every open source project

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:45,080
that they that they work with it's just

00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,580
not feasible they have to pick and

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,039
choose the ones and the strategies that

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:53,980
make the most sense for them so there's

00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,480
also some sort of more advanced

00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,980
techniques and these are like one thing

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,940
is like shared development models

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,770
there's been some really interesting

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,380
work around this like you'll see

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,940
industry consortiums form around key

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,789
things where everybody in that industry

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,990
all needs the same thing so like a lot

00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,940
of people in the hosting industry are

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,490
really involved in an OpenStack right

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,529
it's like Rackspace Red Hat people like

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,320
that and they're all pushing for the

00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:20,450
same thing you also have models where

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,880
they have like group or pooled leverage

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,890
right and aqua created a program here in

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,510
the Drupal community which witch is

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,390
which is no longer active called

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:32,029
large-scale Drupal LSD and that was

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,919
focused on again gaining common

00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,750
requirements from a bunch of enterprises

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,669
to try to figure out if you could push a

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,789
set of functionality all at one time

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:42,289
that a bunch of people needed and of

00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,520
course you have distributions as well

00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:46,820
there's plenty of examples in the

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,870
community of distributions where bunch

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,080
of people are working on the same

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,220
problem set and

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,179
can take the bait and talk about that

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,620
for days but here's a really interesting

00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:58,720
one I just wanted to point it out

00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,429
there's also the trend called inner

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,919
source and inner source is this sort of

00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:05,679
dogfooding scenario in which in which

00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,960
the processes of open source are brought

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,360
inside an enterprise so the enterprise

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,850
actually works internally within their

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,759
own development as if they're an open

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,070
source project right and then paypal is

00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,320
actually went one step further and then

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,769
they they open source to their inner

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,909
source if that makes sense so they

00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:27,730
brought a way of developing software

00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:29,710
internal in-house and then they took the

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,509
documentation and the methodology around

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,830
that and then they open sourced it and

00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:35,249
they put it out there for anyone else to

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,929
use so it's this sort of cyclical

00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:41,740
pattern of openness that's kind of kind

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:44,409
of interesting oh then of course there's

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:47,559
good old money right financial patronage

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,940
is always welcome and you think you'd be

00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:51,669
hard-pressed to find an open source

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,240
community that doesn't benefit from that

00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:57,519
and the models go everything from

00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,759
sponsorships to grant google summer of

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,649
code is a great example I can't remember

00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,200
the exact number by read but in my

00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:07,029
research day they said over the years of

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,460
the new google Summer of Code it's you

00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:11,740
know it's like 115 million lines of open

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,720
source code have been written and of

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,580
course you know everyone just chuckle

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,240
and say that doesn't equal quality right

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:21,340
yeah the old slock problem but but I

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,259
think it's an important distinction to

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,909
understand that you know you can put a

00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:27,759
little money behind creating a lot of

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:30,970
good and open-source there are examples

00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,710
of sprint's right so right now there's a

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,350
talk going on in another room about the

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:38,259
module acceleration program which is a

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:41,049
move to push the the next set of really

00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:44,200
important d eight modules faster and do

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:47,630
and do sprints and find actually sponsor

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,580
and hire some of the contributors behind

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,780
these are all ways to put money at the

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,920
problem and of course money doesn't

00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,230
solve everything but it certainly

00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,490
creates a lot of a lot of wiggle room

00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:01,070
for people to develop code in this model

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,990
so i wanna i wanted to tell just kind of

00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,580
a brief in yet and then in this hope

00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,710
this will be kind of quick because it

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,330
because the time but you know i was like

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,830
going through this mental exercises like

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,900
how do I explain this if I'm like

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,580
talking to someone from enterprising how

00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,870
do I explain how I think they should

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,490
engage with the community or how they

00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,960
should participate that's different than

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,580
the way they do now so I was thinking of

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,590
like this a tale of two companies right

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,320
you have like one company called use

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,730
Corp right and they're they're like you

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,410
know maybe they're both these companies

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,030
are seeking to do a triple project right

00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,980
let's just imagine they're both same

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,440
timeline same goals you know maybe their

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,030
director creditors right and use

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,980
corporates got this idea that you know

00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,950
they want to use the cost advantages in

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,480
the quick time to market of Drupal and

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,830
but they don't know a lot about the

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,200
product they've researched it they may

00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,730
Ritz ministry reports but they've never

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,760
used it they have no direct experience

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,350
right and engage calm is you know they

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,030
want to use triple do and creates Chris

00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,340
speed to market they hope to gain a lot

00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,790
from Community Innovation they also have

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,590
no direct experience but they've chosen

00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,000
to engage the community and leverage all

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,320
that it offers and I just wanted to kind

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,480
of walk through how do those two

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,820
experiences differ same software same

00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,620
kinds of companies same circumstances

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,370
right and will it result in the same

00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,770
type of thing so you know at the

00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:19,070
business case level you know use Corp

00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,750
goes out they they go to management they

00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,270
say hey we got this great thing we're

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,130
going to do drupal they they postulate

00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,860
an ROI of four hundred percent on the

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,330
project based upon some exaggerated case

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,180
studies that they've read in the public

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,470
sphere they talk to industry Angeles but

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,110
those people have never really

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,790
implemented the technology and they take

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,050
those claims at face value and they say

00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,210
hey we're going to four hundred percent

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,670
return on this project right now I mean

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,230
while engaged commis talked to a lot of

00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,240
trusted sources within the community

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,830
they've been to Drupal com they've been

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,960
to Drupal meetups they've conducted

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,310
they've talked people who've done very

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,040
similar implementations and they've

00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:57,140
learned some benchmarks for them right

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,460
and they also know from talking those

00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,940
people that what they're asking for us

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,370
extends

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,110
customization and as a result they've

00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,650
chosen a more conservative return on

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:09,440
investment of two hundred percent right

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:11,060
so as they go into vendor selection use

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,710
Corp knows that they need a vendor

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,080
that's used this technology and has

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,150
experience with it but they kind of just

00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,890
rely on the fact that this company has

00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,930
done this before and they don't look a

00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:23,270
lot at participation or involvement in

00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:25,430
the community as a key factor meanwhile

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,440
engage calm wants people who are

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,940
actually recognized in the community and

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,460
the project for their involvement and

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,040
they're very concerned about getting a

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,070
team on their side that they can

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,900
demonstrate the ROI goals but but but

00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,940
also they want to engage the community

00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,580
experts the individuals out there that

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:47,680
they've met to help them Shepherd this

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:51,050
project along so at project initiation

00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,660
use Corp you know they work with their

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,010
vendor they spec out features they treat

00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,690
it more like a product because they

00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,810
really don't understand that unique

00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,400
framework and aspect of Drupal they

00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:05,090
create a project plan that's based

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,560
largely upon guesswork and you know it

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,630
doesn't recognize some of the pitfalls

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,860
and best practices from the community

00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,920
because they just haven't talked to

00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,600
people meanwhile engage com has project

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,030
Sherpas they literally have people out

00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,890
there that they've engaged that they

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,090
think are going to be able to carry them

00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,940
through this project and give them

00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:26,210
advice in key areas they start attending

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,190
local meetups they bring questions they

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,930
even plan talks of their own right they

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,270
practice sharing their own knowledge

00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,800
back with people and they've engaged

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,450
their vendor for some additional

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,940
training so that they can get a team up

00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,330
to speed in addition to just building

00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:44,480
the project I swear I'm not going to go

00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:47,060
through every stage of a project so

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,370
proud project education project

00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,530
execution use corpse running a little

00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,570
late right the requested functionalities

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,450
non-standard from Drupal and because

00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:57,470
these customer requirements are

00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,850
something that they have no experience

00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,310
coding they're actually writing custom

00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,680
modules when they don't need to be and

00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,790
so the vendor that they have is never

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,560
developed in this way and their

00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,589
estimates are off base and their views

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,229
guys are really start

00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:13,019
slip behind but in the gate in the gauge

00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:14,969
column model they've modified a lot of

00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:16,440
the requested functionality to adhere to

00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:17,999
some of the best practices so they've

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,229
understood what works in the community

00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,940
and they've changed their approach as a

00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:23,219
result they don't have they don't have

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,140
locked in requirements and they've

00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:27,630
started with the distribution and best

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,099
practices modules so they're not writing

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,380
a lot of custom code and they're not

00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:35,219
starting from the ground up and as a

00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:40,170
result their project is on time and it

00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:42,779
is on budget at project completion you

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,489
score is getting close to launch but

00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:47,549
they're really frustrated by the amount

00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:50,489
of testing issue resolution defects

00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:52,140
problems that they're surfacing and they

00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:54,059
don't really have a great way to get

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,739
around it they're their vendors working

00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:57,329
very hard to patch it but they're

00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:59,519
writing a lot of workarounds they're

00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:01,019
working with custom modules now and

00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,549
they're hacks and they're just trying to

00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,869
get the thing live and they know they're

00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:06,210
going to have to come back and fix

00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:09,619
things but they're in a scramble to meet

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:12,329
their their deadlines and engage calm

00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:15,539
the team is very calm as they approach

00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:17,099
launch they they understand you know

00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:18,660
what it's going to take to get live and

00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,219
they're really focused just on the user

00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,319
experience they have the time to polish

00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:25,589
they're not stuck on trying to get the

00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:28,940
core functionality to work the launch

00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:32,009
goes very smoothly and the team has

00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,900
basically an advisory and a transition

00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:35,430
team in place at launch so they already

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,339
know how they're going to carry the

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,049
thing forward and they've got additional

00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,609
work lined up from their vendor who's

00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:45,660
prepared to step in and help them if

00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:47,940
they stumble in any way so as it goes

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,369
into the final final stages of this

00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,190
there is a transition and a maintenance

00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,049
period that occurs right but use Corp

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,700
isn't ready to inherit the system that

00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,109
they have they've they've commissioned

00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,869
and built a system that they truly don't

00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:03,839
understand they have to argue with their

00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:05,759
vendor / warranty issues they don't feel

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,079
prepared to take the system over and so

00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:08,999
as a result they're aggressively

00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,130
positioning with their vendor to try to

00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:13,890
keep them on to do to do work longer

00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:16,700
right the system continues to be plagued

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,830
by misuse and over customization

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,200
workarounds hacks

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:23,810
and there are roi at this point is

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,550
fallen very short right and they don't

00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,650
even have the concept of total cost of

00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,480
ownership at this point there is no life

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:32,180
beyond this project they just want to

00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,850
get live they blame Drupal they blame

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,860
the vendor they blame themselves

00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,330
everybody's miserable right and engage

00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,520
calm they understand what they have to

00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,750
work with they understand where that

00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,430
system needs a little more love

00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,470
post-launch and they have a team both

00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:48,710
in-house and with their partners that's

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:51,500
ready to continue that trajectory they

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:54,410
they have met their very reasonable ROI

00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,120
and and they're already starting to look

00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,950
at the total cost of this of this

00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,810
product what is it going to cost in a

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,250
three or five-year life cycle they're

00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,330
looking ahead they understand that they

00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,500
have something now that they're

00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,680
committed to that they're going to be

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,090
using and they bark immediately upon

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,260
post launch improvements and

00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,500
enhancements that will continue

00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,300
throughout the life of that system so

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:20,960
what's the lesson don't be used court

00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:22,460
right they suck but and that's all that

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,620
sort of it I realized that sort of a

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,860
long belabored example but you know

00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,930
these things happen and what happens is

00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:31,370
on every single project we want to do

00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,560
the right thing we want to be open

00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,350
source but we don't really value and

00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:39,080
understand the ways in which not being

00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:41,330
that can start to drag us down it makes

00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,730
us late it we don't see our return on

00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,500
investment we don't we're not in a good

00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,570
position to take over a system we don't

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,390
understand where things went wrong why

00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,860
there are bugs why it's not standard why

00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,930
it's difficult to maintain why there

00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,660
isn't documentation these things happen

00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,220
in little slow cuts along the way it's

00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,050
like a thousand death by a thousand

00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,340
paper cuts right and it happens along

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,200
the way and it all starts with that

00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,240
posturing towards being open in your

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,800
approach to doing it and finding other

00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,840
people in the community who are willing

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,690
to help you instead of going out and a

00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,370
closed and proprietary manner so those

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:16,010
are really the keys it from that lesson

00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:18,170
so the last segment I just want to talk

00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,330
about a little bit is valuing open

00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,970
source in the enterprise so I've given

00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:25,430
you a lot of reasons why enterprises use

00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,840
open source why they participate in open

00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,600
source why they contribute to open

00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,850
source but how do they value right like

00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,010
because at the end of the day

00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:35,980
it's all about being able to understand

00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:38,110
if you can if you can place a value to

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,910
working in a certain way and you have to

00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,890
be able to demonstrate that in big

00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:44,440
companies and enterprises it's all about

00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:46,150
making a case for why that is better

00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,960
than the alternative right it's a very

00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:52,840
rational set of thoughts so this is a

00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,820
good quote this one came from google so

00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,410
this is one of the communications

00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,090
manager for their open source projects

00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,190
and they said googles mission is to make

00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:02,200
the internet more available to as many

00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:05,320
people as possible i think i've heard it

00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,910
worded more eloquently before but but

00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,560
you know if ambitious projects like

00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,880
android and chrome have given users more

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,830
access that's certainly in line with

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,660
their goals so they're they're making

00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:15,700
connections between their mission and

00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,830
the reasons that they do open source

00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,140
right and when the more you can do that

00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,300
as a business the more the purpose seeps

00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:26,740
into the way that you contribute and you

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:28,450
work with a community so when you look

00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,570
at enterprises that have been successful

00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:33,730
in in open source models you see a lot

00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,890
of things emerging but that commitment

00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,950
usually starts at the c-suite right you

00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:41,050
have to get the CTOs and the cios to be

00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,460
able to champion for the use of open

00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,020
source it has to start at the top

00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,200
otherwise you're going to be fighting

00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:49,540
all the way up and you want to make a

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,370
business case based upon total cost of

00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,690
ownership not return on investment and

00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:55,210
I'll talk about that a little more

00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,100
detail a minute these are people who

00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:59,790
leverage the openness of community

00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,960
information and that's not necessarily

00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:04,540
just kind of you know an altruistic

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,760
thing they literally get free training

00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:10,210
free information free best practices

00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,980
free pitfalls to avoid by listening in

00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:14,530
coming to conferences reading the blogs

00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,210
doing things like that these are not

00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,540
things that proprietary software

00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,220
companies tend to put out in great great

00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,690
volumes right they control the

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,560
information about what that software

00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:28,210
does or doesn't do well this is open and

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,370
then they're also committed to tailoring

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,410
their approach to the nuances of the way

00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,680
that that works so like I talked about

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,810
in the youth corp in the engage calm

00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,240
situation if you understand that there's

00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,990
been ten implementations done in similar

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,210
industries or around similar salute

00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,010
is yours you know who those people are

00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,860
you can talk to them directly and you

00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,420
asked them why did this not go right or

00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,400
what didn't go right why didn't it work

00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,290
but people always end up telling you is

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,730
they go you know I thought like you know

00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,990
does take a publisher we used to work

00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,290
with publishers all the time every

00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:02,360
single publisher says customizing the

00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,220
workflow is absolutely critical to the

00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,830
way that you know this magazine

00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:10,310
publishes their content right they all

00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:11,600
say it right guess what they spend a ton

00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,880
of money on it and none of them ever

00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,650
used their damn workflow right and if

00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,000
they just went out and listen to learn

00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,770
that and said okay we're just going to

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,780
accept a standard workflow that works

00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,119
with the workbench module in Drupal

00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,950
right we'll let you customize a few

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,170
states a few transitions and some

00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:28,880
notifications but don't write anything

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,530
custom don't go off the rails don't do

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,300
this don't do that you know could you

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:34,220
save ten twenty percent of the project

00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,650
how much of the time and focus went

00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,390
towards this thing that somebody thought

00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,740
was unique because they weren't out

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,080
there talking to other people who have

00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,930
implemented the same thing so there's a

00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,369
lot of value in appreciating and

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,660
understanding which parts of your

00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:52,580
project are truly unique right and of

00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,080
course at the end of the day the ones

00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,090
that are successful are always prepared

00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,530
to put their own resources and capital

00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:03,500
towards the project success so there are

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:05,030
there haters out there right clearly

00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,010
there are people in enterprises they're

00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,200
difficult to deal with and while the

00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,640
CIOs and the CTOs might understand the

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,040
value of this stuff you are going to

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,350
have to confront other groups marketing

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,060
for instance they typically require a

00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,980
much stronger understanding of what that

00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,320
product is going to accomplish for their

00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,200
goals right they're less concerned with

00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,760
how it's built which is what it sounds

00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,740
like when we talk about open source and

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,140
more concerned with what will be built

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,970
right and so that conversation has to

00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,680
change to maybe the features the

00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,480
innovation aspects the wisdom of the

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,750
crowd those other arguments not the cost

00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,790
arguments the kurma requires a stronger

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,920
understanding of how open source differs

00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,540
from buying a product they're going to

00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,460
compare everything to the model of

00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,950
purchasing a product right and so you

00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,359
have to find a way to place the value of

00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,900
a more

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,819
nuanced set a flexible software into

00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,920
those terms for them to make them see

00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:59,109
the value finance is going to

00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,180
immediately look for that our ally and

00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:03,849
you have to change the thinking from roi

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,430
to total cost of ownership and again I

00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:08,589
swear I've a slide on that and then of

00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,569
course there's legal their pains in the

00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:14,200
asses man aren't they pains in the asses

00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:15,700
now I'm just kidding legal are are an

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,779
incredibly important part of it but if

00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,970
you're in an enterprise you have to

00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:20,259
understand that you are interacting in a

00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,630
world in which your intellectual

00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,609
property your trademarks your secrets

00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,109
those things do you need to be protected

00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:29,049
right and you have to make them feel

00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:30,460
comfortable that your use and engage in

00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:33,339
an open source community is not

00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,140
endangering intellectual property and

00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:38,650
that's a very serious thing when you

00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:40,180
think about GPL you know GPL is the

00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:43,890
licensing model that Drupal is done

00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:46,089
under and it is a very promiscuous

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,880
open-source software license right it

00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:50,680
allows people who when anything

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,440
interacts with GPO it allows that to

00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,390
flow down and Canadian essence open

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,880
source things you don't want to so

00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:00,249
there's valid concern but I think it can

00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,779
be managed so these are some of the ways

00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:03,339
that you have to put these different

00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:05,680
arguments and these different beliefs

00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:07,089
and ideas to test with these different

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,069
groups because none of them are going to

00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:10,989
see the problem the same way it's not

00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:16,779
just financial and it's not just how the

00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:18,160
software gets rid so some of the some of

00:46:16,779 --> 00:46:21,849
the ways that leading enterprises that

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,829
I've talked to measure success on the

00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:25,900
quantitative side there is return on

00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:27,489
investment right and return on

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,289
investment is really only part of the

00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:31,210
picture right it's immediate it's

00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:33,700
important for immediate success return

00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:36,339
on investment says I'm going to spend X

00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,230
and I'm going to get Y back great that's

00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:40,329
a return on investment calculation its

00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,190
simplest form it works really well for

00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:43,930
an initial project right we're going to

00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,849
spend zero on licensing fees we're going

00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,890
to spend half a million dollars on

00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:49,989
vendor fees are going to spend 100

00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,519
thousand dollars on hosting fees fifty

00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:52,809
thousand dollars on training fees and in

00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,430
the end we think we'll get a value

00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:57,009
that's greater than whatever the

00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:01,619
whatever I just created six hundred

00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:04,319
fifty thousand dollars right and but

00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:06,710
you know but what's baked into that is

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,630
the S is in essence an argument of

00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,999
efficiency right so what's really hard

00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,950
to say is well using this over that will

00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:16,619
be 10 times more efficient so you have

00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:18,930
to find metrics and ways to quantify the

00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:21,029
efficiency of working in open source vs.

00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:23,759
working the proprietary models and so

00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:25,349
that's another important component on

00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:26,640
the qualitative side there's there's

00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:30,869
innovation and we talked a bit about

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,630
that it's by far the most important

00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:34,950
aspect for a competitive industry so if

00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,539
you're one of these Silicon Valley

00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:38,299
companies as talking about a technology

00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:40,289
industry company or something like that

00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:42,119
innovation and your ability to get

00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:44,039
innovation from open sources probably

00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,450
one of the most valuable things you can

00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:47,849
take away from it and one of the best

00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:51,720
cases and arguments that you can make to

00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:53,900
justify your participation there's also

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,660
the softer side the people and culture

00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:59,579
it's hard to quantify right but but when

00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,190
you realize how difficult and how hard

00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,839
talent is to come by you probably

00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,690
already if you're an enterprise they're

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,190
probably already metrics in place on how

00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,779
hard it on what it cost to recruit

00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:12,420
someone or what it cost to retain

00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:14,670
someone or how high they're expecting

00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:17,220
their attrition rate to be or not to be

00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:19,049
so there are probably metrics out there

00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,440
that you can support and piggyback on

00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:24,059
that are already a part of the the DHR

00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,239
world or the people world in an

00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:29,670
enterprise when you drop all that down

00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:31,710
the uber metric for open source is total

00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:33,269
cost of ownership so total cost of

00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,640
ownership takes all these things to

00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:38,700
consideration right it looks at the long

00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,349
lifecycle of a system and it says when

00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,930
we implement this thing it's a two or

00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:44,640
three or four or five year life cycle

00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,249
right and over the course of that time

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,950
there's going to be all these tangible

00:48:47,249 --> 00:48:52,079
and intangible benefits that go into why

00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,480
we made this platform decision right

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,670
it's a longer view and the longer view

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,309
includes includes that retention and

00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:02,460
that recruitment and that training it

00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:04,440
also includes all the innovative aspects

00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,420
that you forgo it includes the number of

00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,029
people you did or didn't have to hire to

00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,670
support this versus an alternative and

00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:13,670
it also incorporates that initial ROI so

00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:18,170
total cost of ownership is the

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:19,910
uber metric or open-source contrary for

00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,099
open-source engagement in an enterprise

00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:24,859
if you have people in your organization

00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:26,510
at the top executive levels that are

00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:28,819
willing to give you the benefit of the

00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,619
doubt for the long view the platform the

00:49:28,819 --> 00:49:32,270
three to five years this is the way to

00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:34,400
make the case there's so many things

00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:35,690
that baked into this that are that are

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,910
more important than just the initial

00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:42,380
return on investment so yeah so I did

00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,640
talk quite a bit about total cost of

00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,680
ownership and if anyone has any

00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:50,270
questions about that you can you can see

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:52,160
me after or send me an email um so so I

00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:53,660
have some recommendations for enterprise

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,400
participation I just kind of want to

00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:58,339
walk through and then I'll stop and do

00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,319
some questions you know the way I talked

00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:01,849
about it earlier is like I think there

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,290
is a unique strategy for every

00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:05,000
Enterprise right you're going to pick

00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,650
and choose from a lot of these tactics

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,059
from a lot of these approaches and

00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,280
you're going to develop something it's

00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:12,430
unique to you for the specific platform

00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,290
the year that you're dealing with right

00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:19,640
but there are levels right and I see it

00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:22,730
as as a progression sorry I give myself

00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,890
a time limit field so there are

00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:26,900
progressions I see it as a series of

00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:29,089
almost like levels or platforms that you

00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:32,329
move through right and the way I would

00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:33,859
approach it if I were on the other side

00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:37,010
and now we're a large enterprise if I

00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:38,690
was the CTO or CIO of some enterprising

00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:40,220
knowing what I know over the years that

00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:43,099
we've worked an open source I would

00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,569
advise that people progress logically

00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:46,579
through these things and see it as an

00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:47,930
investment so as you move through the

00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:50,180
first level you do some of these things

00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:52,339
and if you're seeing value if you're

00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,930
seeing that it's contributing that to

00:50:52,339 --> 00:50:55,549
that total cost of ownership then you

00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:56,960
double down and you do more and you do

00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:59,150
more and you're more it's not like

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,430
everybody has to roll in day one roll

00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,200
out the red carpet get a booth you know

00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,030
print some t-shirts and send your whole

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,609
team here and say hey we're all in on

00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:09,799
Drupal right I mean you move this way

00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:13,069
over a period of time and you see if

00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:14,569
it's reciprocating that value so the

00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,790
first thing I think is like those low

00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:19,640
cost and free learning resources like

00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:21,460
people totally undervalue how cheap and

00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,720
easy it is to get good training

00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:26,080
materials through an open source project

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,930
right even our paid materials are cheap

00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:31,420
right so even if you buy a subscription

00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:34,359
to Drupal eyes me or you go RL you know

00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:36,070
every talk is being videotaped I don't

00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:40,300
every time is this being videotaped oh

00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:41,470
crap I hope not so you know we videotape

00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,240
these talks we put them out on the

00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:45,700
internet they're available for free it's

00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,410
an amazingly great resource right the

00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:50,140
next thing is like really understanding

00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:52,780
those those true platform pitfalls like

00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:55,290
I talked about so you know go out and

00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:57,580
find me you know the five biggest

00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:00,119
scenarios in which adobe enterprise

00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:05,020
manager has failed in the last year

00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:06,580
Google that right versus you know going

00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,380
out and being able to talk very candidly

00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,230
and openly with people in your same

00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:12,640
industry about how they've used Drupal

00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:15,400
unsuccessfully right it's an incredibly

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,650
powerful resource available to you and

00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,690
then there's you know hiring consultants

00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:21,220
who who have deep expertise in the

00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:23,349
project in the community can help you

00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,180
make informed recommendations right it's

00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:28,420
a super important part of the process is

00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:30,430
to understand who out there whether it's

00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,680
an individual or it's a it's a large

00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:34,930
shop or it's a it's an implementer or

00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,849
frankly you could just be a bunch of

00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:38,200
people that you really trust but you can

00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:39,730
find consultants who are willing to

00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,920
Shepherd you through the process I

00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:43,930
called it project Sherpas right people

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,240
who will carry you through the community

00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:49,359
in that process and literally show you

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,490
the way the second level is you kind of

00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,440
graduate some intermediate intermediate

00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:54,880
strategies like I talked about starting

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,920
from a foundation you use the best

00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,260
modules distributions approaches

00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:02,109
architectures you know don't figure out

00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,460
how to make these things in Drupal do

00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:05,530
what you want to do when other people

00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:09,220
have already done right take advantage

00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:11,290
of that you know the the Sherpas the

00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:14,890
community guides to help you find the

00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:16,660
best practices I talked about leveraging

00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,310
community innovation I think the next

00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,839
step is really understanding like what

00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,190
are the things out there that you think

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,619
you can get from the project that you

00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:26,109
yourself don't want to necessarily build

00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:27,849
but you can monitor and see how someone

00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:31,119
else is progressing on the key things

00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:32,830
for yourselves you get to that third

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,810
level is like an advanced level right

00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,160
and there that's where you probably

00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,420
to start building your own experts

00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,210
that's where you may be recruit some

00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,710
people from the community for yourself

00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:43,000
you're making targeted contributions

00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,560
you're picking areas where your

00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,680
contribution can actually get into the

00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,300
project can be successful and maybe

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,680
you're even advancing the point when you

00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:53,620
know some of the strings you can pull

00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,300
like you know some of the people and the

00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,550
key contacts that can help you with that

00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:01,120
issue queue wrangling they can help you

00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:03,040
control pieces of your contribution or

00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,560
the code that are relevant to you right

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,860
you're dancing up that sort of value

00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,840
chain that way at the very top like the

00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,850
sort of expert strategies the things

00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,530
that you know I'd really only recommend

00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:17,010
when you drink it up there is you know

00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:19,240
maybe maybe picking an area of this

00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:21,280
community where thought leadership and

00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,660
ownership of key modules is something

00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,760
that's good for you for brand awareness

00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,130
for knowledge for competitive reasons

00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,630
right and kind of plant in your flag and

00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,810
owning that corner corner of the

00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:33,910
universe getting ahead of the roadmap

00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,200
and by using that deep deep knowledge to

00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,760
understand what the project is headed

00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,530
like listening to jesus talk today and

00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,000
saying hey those are things that are

00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,470
going to be good for us in Drupal in

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,240
three years right Internet of Things

00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,890
what are the way now that I know that

00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,530
the roadmap is going that way I know

00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,690
that you know he wants to use Alexa to

00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:53,140
create content types or whatever then

00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:55,420
now I can actually I can actually

00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:57,430
understand how maybe I can work that

00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,470
into what I'm doing with this product

00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:01,390
and then the last thing is getting your

00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:03,220
own agenda into the roadmap right so

00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,200
that's where you're really developing a

00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,510
team that can influence the direction of

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,950
the project itself maybe their core

00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,180
contributors maybe you're hiring core

00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,590
contributors and they're actually

00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,150
changing things in a way that's

00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,980
beneficial to you or maybe you're just

00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,020
making major contributions and those

00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,100
contributions are influencing that but

00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,180
you're actually getting in there and

00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,890
you're moving the direction you're

00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,450
serving your own agenda and those are

00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:24,010
sort of the levels right you can see how

00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:26,110
it advances you don't start at that

00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,300
level you start at the basics and you

00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:30,460
move your way along and in each stage if

00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,280
you're working with the CIO or CTO or

00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:35,410
somebody who's who's championing this

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,300
project you're demonstrating to them the

00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:39,250
return on investment and the total cost

00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,900
of ownership in the long run for your

00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:44,080
investment in each stage as you progress

00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,850
right so I want to thank some of the

00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,170
people that helped just

00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:49,390
names of some of the companies I talked

00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:51,790
to an interview I read a lot of articles

00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:53,710
and I talked a lot of people and they

00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:56,470
certainly don't have the the total base

00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:58,120
of knowledge here but once again you

00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:59,590
know getting out there and learning

00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,060
what's worked for other people it's

00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,890
probably one of the best practices you

00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,570
can get out of this community and one of

00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:06,100
the reasons why personally I enjoy

00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,410
giving these talks because I just I

00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,640
learned so much by just interviewing

00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,830
these people and trying to figure out

00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:15,280
what works for you how did how did this

00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:17,470
even come about like wire hey Pfizer why

00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,090
do you have you know 42 people that are

00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:21,550
contributing to the dribble project or

00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:23,230
NBC why do you have a booth at drupalcon

00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:25,120
right I mean these are really

00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:27,250
interesting conversations to have with

00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,020
people and I encourage you to do some of

00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,480
that some of that communication yourself

00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:35,140
so with that I guess I have a few

00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:49,690
minutes for Q&A not long but I could

00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:51,690
probably take one or two questions do we

00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:53,800
have the next are you then speaker

00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,840
probably need to let somebody get get

00:56:53,800 --> 00:57:01,910
set up

00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:04,020
yes sir my first contribution to Drupal

00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:12,710
does it have to be code because I'm not

00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:12,710
a developer damn Frank what do you think

00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:19,110
yeah running the DC drupal meetup yeah

00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:23,550
that's probably like 2009 or something

00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:30,770
like that maybe oh yeah no sorry 2007

00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:30,770
