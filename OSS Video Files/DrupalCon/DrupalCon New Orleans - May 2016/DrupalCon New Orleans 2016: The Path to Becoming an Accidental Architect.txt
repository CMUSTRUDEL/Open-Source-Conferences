Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: The Path to Becoming an Accidental Architect
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Drupal is a really fantastic platform for developing cool and complicated things, but the problem with making cool and complicated things is that if you haven't thought about how build them beforehand, you can end up backed into a corner, with every change to your project being expensive and difficult.

Software architecture is the solution to that problem!

The Drupal architect is the big picture person who listens, thinks, and sets plans in motion. They listen to the customer's needs, then translate those into technical solution possibilities, weigh options on how things will work together, with an eye towards the future, and then create a plan on how to implement those possibilities into Drupal solutions that will keep costs and technical debt down while ensuring flexibility for future changes.

So, do you want to be that person? Do you already find yourself thinking about these things, are people already asking you these questions? Have people stopped handing you coding tasks, and instead started expecting you to provide the coding solution?

This session will help you find your way in the transition between Drupal developer and Drupal architect. You will find effective strategies to improve your soft-skills, be able to identify and understand the benefits of some different architectures, and when we are done, you will walk away with some great resources, and with some new directions of thinking of what it means to be a Drupal architect.

I will answer these questions:

What is an architect?

How does the role of Drupal architect differ from the many other types of architects?

Am I an architect right now?

How can I move from developer to architect?

What skills are needed to be a great Drupal architect?

How do you Architect in an Agile approach?

How does a Architect differ from the Lead Developer?

	00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:09,540
so does anyone know what happens when

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,340
you ask your friend if there's going to

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,289
be in your architecture sessions at the

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,779
next group lacan yeah this guy right

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:25,230
here says not until you make one get

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:27,269
cracking so here we are in case you

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,939
walked into the wrong room we get

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,470
introductions out of the way this is the

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,160
path to becoming an accidental architect

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,739
I am Patrick tell you I work for a

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,059
company called POW tech right now

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,059
contracted the u.s. Forest Service

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,070
little story about the title of this

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,170
session in October of 2014 I had my

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,260
second interview at the Forest Service

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,329
and during that interview they had all

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,280
kinds of questions which apparently i

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,359
answered to their satisfaction they're

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,140
all about enterprise drupal architecture

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,910
they even mentioned that they were

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,960
already satisfied with my developer

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,000
skills via the pre-interview steps and

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,439
my first interview and we're only

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,010
interested in the ideas around

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,020
enterprise drupal architecture now I

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,229
call this accidental because the

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,450
position I was in for NBC at that time

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:24,630
was just sort of a senior drupal

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,790
developer role and not drivel architect

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,200
and they weren't hiring for drupal

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,270
architect this was a couple of

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,810
interviews in before I heard any of this

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:38,330
and so it wasn't even in the job

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,159
description there's nothing about

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,720
the whole pole was that i could start

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,130
working from home again for the same pay

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,619
and i was pretty good with that so but

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,240
my job since then has been pretty much

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,299
entirely filled with architectural

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,430
decisions that's that's been my role I

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,690
came on we had two other developers and

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,770
they just started asking me okay how are

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,049
we going to do this and how we're going

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,340
to do that you're the Drupal expert so

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,110
solve this for us so probably a good

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,090
time to tell you this entire session is

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,860
going to be recorded so you don't really

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,209
have to take notes the entire slide

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,880
decks can be on the session page one or

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:18,989
done too so don't worry about it just

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,319
sit back and enjoy also up until about

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:25,170
45 50 minutes ago I was editing this so

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,459
I don't have it all memorized so I'm

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,360
going to be looking at my screen quite a

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,100
bit just to get that out of the way I am

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,840
pretty comfortable with the material but

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,519
i changed it so much so you'll notice

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,540
the stronger they go theme here too

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:45,810
we'll get into that in a minute so what

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,760
are we here for today I can think of a

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,950
couple reasons why any of you in the

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,570
audience might be here maybe you're

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,910
looking to figure out how to go from

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,290
where you are now like drupal developer

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,579
or possibly eat or project manager to

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,970
drew Blair kitang you want to know how

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,829
to do that if you're trying to figure

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,480
out if you already are an architect or

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:10,140
maybe you're like Larry and you're here

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,980
to heckle me I doubt most of you are

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,570
probably on that first group making the

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,820
purpose of this session how to help to

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,420
build a better you so you can help your

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,420
customers better

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,349
so that's marvelous that sounds great

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,870
how am I going to do this little bit of

00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,840
magic to make you better when you leave

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,550
than when you came in well we're going

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,470
to do it by following a path from one of

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,500
my favorite books the success principles

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,060
by jack canfield in that book it's all

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,760
about getting from where you are to

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:49,349
where you want to be applied that to

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,269
numerous things in my life and it's

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,269
worked really really effectively for me

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,390
so I figured I'd put it on this so let's

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,090
break this down into a few steps what

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,019
are two easy steps first we're going to

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,420
talk about the definitions of

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,340
architecture software architecture and

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,829
Drupal architecture what they are how

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,629
they're similar how's it different this

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,690
is going to cover the where you want to

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:15,840
be part next we're going to talk about

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,760
where you are on this path which of

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,079
course is to where you are part and then

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,370
next we're going to be talking about the

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,720
largest part of the talk which is the

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,520
how you get there and that part i'm

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,990
going to be talking about traits that

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,539
make up an architect or really anybody

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,740
who wants to be better at building

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:37,200
solutions and then we're going to cover

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,770
some resources i've been either reading

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,440
or watching or happened into over the

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,810
past for this session at the end of me

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,919
to let you in on some of the things that

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,120
experts have tweeted back at me and then

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,300
i'll give you an opportunity to ask some

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,729
questions if we have any time left after

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,129
that which we will because this is

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:02,360
probably gonna run a little bit long

00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:02,360
we'll get out early

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:19,550
so when I started doing this I was

00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:22,759
basically interested in how to apply

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,669
software architecture paradigms to

00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,620
Drupal and to do that I started looking

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,870
at the definitions for software

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,690
architecture and I'll tell you they're

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,759
vague there's there's no set definition

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,780
that I could find that cover everything

00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:42,050
that I had been reading or viewing

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,400
wikipedia has an okay definition and for

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,300
this for the purpose of this talk I

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,970
think we're going to use that one their

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,979
definition is that a software architect

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,840
is a software expert who makes high

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,880
level design choices and dictates

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,569
technical standards including software

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,680
coding standards tools and platforms the

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,159
leading expert is called a chief

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,889
architect I think we can break that down

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:10,159
into a couple of key points there an

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,659
expert their software expert they make

00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,909
high-level choices they dictate

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,990
technical standards and we can infer

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:16,310
from the rest they know how to

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,659
communicate these things because they

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,780
don't live in a box and not talk to

00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:24,320
people so I didn't seem too bad I think

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,330
we can work at that obviously beyond

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,509
this definition there's a whole vast

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,830
world of stuff that you can discuss

00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,930
relating to software architecture

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,380
there's understanding large code bases

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,270
there's testing tools there's there's a

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,120
whole world out there that's beyond this

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,150
but to start we're going to start at

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,069
this point the software architectural

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,539
world is a very broad and flexible and

00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,979
just so you know

00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:55,000
let's look at our neck of the woods what

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:56,710
is a Drupal architect there's there's no

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Wikipedia definition for this obviously

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,340
so I basically made one up and asked my

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,840
friends and they said yeah that's okay

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,430
so we're going to go with that and it is

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,780
the Drupal expert with lots of site

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,550
building experience in a variety of

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,050
project sizes who understands all

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,020
aspects of the Drupal site creation

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,599
process and is able to effectively

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,580
develop a communicative plan of how a

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:26,590
system involving Drupal should be

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,889
executed way from there you take the

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,889
picture

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,530
probably Larry so we can break this one

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,930
down into a definition or the definition

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,480
to a couple of points as well this

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,210
person would be a Drupal expert and not

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,310
just a part of Drupal not like a

00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,260
front-end expert we're back into expert

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,330
this would be all understanding all of

00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,060
Drupal you don't and I don't mean an

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,460
expert in every part I mean somebody who

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,830
literally understands how it all works

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,130
together this person would have a breath

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,540
not a depth of knowledge doesn't mean

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,530
that they can't understand something in

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,420
depth but that's not the requirement

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,510
next they can devise a plan of things

00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,880
involving drupal note this doesn't say

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,700
only Drupal it's things involving

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,550
durable Drupal's part of larger systems

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:34,450
very often they can communicate this

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,630
plan that they devised so are they the

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,630
same

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,160
definite sort of there's a ton of

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,770
similarities but kind of a

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,920
microscale both require expertise

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:50,500
experience this one is kind of the same

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,150
both make high level design choices and

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,760
Drupal this is called develop a plan of

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,680
system involving Drupal but it's

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,020
basically the same thing sometimes

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,220
dictate technical standards this wasn't

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,960
really mentioned in the drip one but

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,040
that you do that i would say that Drupal

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,750
architects definitely have to dictate

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,690
project standards features coding

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,220
standards are already kind of in Drupal

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,160
if for anything odd they do have to be

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,840
the person that makes that decision and

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,850
know how to communicate all of the above

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,340
that's definitely the same in both it's

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,450
a requirement you can plan all you want

00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,670
but if you can't communicate it it

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,610
doesn't really matter on the business

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,810
side of things it's pretty similar

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,120
architects need to get buy-in from

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,100
necessary parties they need to navigate

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,830
office politics that you've got to be

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,540
able to talk business code systems they

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,550
have to be able to translate between all

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,660
of those they need to deal with the

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,140
budget and the human resource

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:50,500
constraints and everything so very

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,940
similar looking a little bit more

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,650
closely though we can see a lot of

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,990
differences one of the biggest ones is

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,450
the fact that these decisions many of

00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,800
them have already been made for us often

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,410
we don't have to pick language or

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,410
security type or an architecture they're

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,410
already in Drupal before anybody says

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,580
anything I know that there's a flip side

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,240
all of you so I'll get to that in a

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:16,450
minute this is because Drupal has a lot

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:20,410
of good answers for common questions of

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,870
the topic of needing a CMS and provided

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,570
you're using this as a CMS you're going

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,590
to do okay from the start though like

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,210
with much of what i found in

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,860
architecture there's no absolutes you

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,530
can flip this around every one of these

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,930
can be something you can overwrite but

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,880
take databases for example a Drupal

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,220
architect might want the speed of

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,090
so sequels right out the door

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,950
really though the biggest difference i

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,660
can see between the two is that software

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,440
architecture would usually determine the

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,870
technology of a project after looking at

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,110
all the problems in Drupal architects

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:57,620
case we start from here we start from we

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,660
have a CMS and you know because we know

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:05,810
that the answer to we need to CMS is

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:08,630
Drupal so fast though it doesn't mean we

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,030
get off scot-free because even though

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,040
Drupal makes a lot of st. choices for us

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,840
we know we still have to think about a

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,700
bunch of things that suffer architects

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,950
have to think about or don't have to

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,690
think about like our site structure

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,990
we're going to do multi-site or domains

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:27,050
module etc search engine solutions like

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,790
solar or Google appliance how to

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:34,670
structure your content entities taxonomy

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:39,530
panels versus no panels they use

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:40,370
features lots of questions which modules

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,200
are you going to start off with an

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,020
install profile asset management

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,460
commerce traces will it be headless how

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,610
about your development workflow or your

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,520
content entry workflow cash lots of

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:55,570
stuff so I mean that honestly I think

00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,830
this list could be pretty much endless

00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,630
architects are awfully going to have to

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,520
be weighing all of these options against

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:06,040
manpower and budget constraints as well

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,040
so taking an earlier example

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:20,140
I can't terrible a through Street take

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,810
an earlier example say our Drupal

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,580
architect really wanted but they

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,050
don't have an imago people then I really

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,720
have a budget to hire through

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,860
people to take care of MA go so they're

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,600
probably going to stick with the three

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,610
my sequel developers that they've

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,500
already got so on every journey you need

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,030
at least three things you do the place

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,040
you're going to the place you're

00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,320
starting from and the mechanism that's

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,870
going to take you there so having to

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,120
find the Drupal architect we've kind of

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,700
gone and seen a little bit of what the

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,380
destination is in this section we're

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,880
going to her in the section after this

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,040
one we're going to talk about some of

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,810
the things to get you there but now I

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,140
think that we need to take a look at our

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:05,440
starting point where are you on this

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,750
path are you pretty green or maybe you

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,600
have a ton of experience maybe you're

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,760
already a triple architect I think that

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,160
this journey or any journey of

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,690
self-improvement requires looking at

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,370
where you are so you can build a good

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,600
plan for what it'll take you to get to

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,610
where you're going so I put together a

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,240
couple of little questionnaires that you

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,280
can ask or answer to yourself and just

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,370
think about it

00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:37,360
on this one this is all about the Drupal

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,590
technical stuff I got ten questions

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,050
number one have you been doing this for

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,650
a really long time do you have a ton of

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,600
experience do you have a particular

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,550
convention for organizing your features

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,130
or number three do you not even like

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,320
features before do you have a preference

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,950
on building themes from scratch or using

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,230
a particular base theme have you

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,260
provided more patches or been involved

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:09,350
in those rather long drawn-out like the

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:11,300
issue queue discussions have you helped

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:16,100
others on drupal.org or on in pound

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,990
drupal IRC channel do others come to you

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,710
first when it's on a drupal related

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,550
topic are you starting to forget some

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,550
field projects you've done

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:33,420
yeah have you ever said man I loved rush

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,610
yeah I got hands in the air on that one

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,440
that's a good do you wish that there was

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,610
a module that would remind you to clear

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,110
the freaking cash I do I want a big

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,060
orange button just floats around the

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,449
screen clear the cache Fathead that's

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,829
all i won chances are if you're nodding

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,570
to these you probably got some of the

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,910
technical chops needed to be a Drupal

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,910
arcattack especially that the first one

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,790
experience it's a biggie that's half the

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:03,120
battle next let's look at the softer

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,800
side once again answer these to yourself

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
or you know a lot of you look at our

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,790
liquor do you have the ability to talk

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,850
business side of things with

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:15,990
stakeholders have you had to do much

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,699
estimating that's that's probably the

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,079
biggest one for me Palantir really

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,230
helped me with that I'll get into that

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:26,670
later do you know how to work in more

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:29,990
than one style of project management you

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,990
know scrums not the only one

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,999
are you able to easily come up with many

00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:40,990
suggestions for drupal problems do you

00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:43,929
feel confident in those suggestions do

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,999
they ever get implemented do you get

00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:49,529
compliments for making technical

00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:49,529
concepts easy to understand

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,920
are you do you automatically multiply

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,000
the amount of time you think something

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,000
will take by a factor of X

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,780
the Scottie principal are you

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,360
comfortable communicating with important

00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,200
people have you had projects fail

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,200
spectacularly

00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:17,280
what did you learn and what did you do

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:21,870
to cause it to fail did you take

00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,550
responsibility how many times have you

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:30,030
recommend that the Drupal was not the

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:32,220
right solution that's it how you feeling

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,400
about your answers guys not the latter

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,780
little so so that's all right if you're

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,110
not in your head a lot answering yes

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,730
pretty often you light and if you

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,200
answered yes to the lot of last ones you

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,470
might be pretty close on your road to

00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,200
getting towards Drupal architect if not

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,900
that's why we're here it's okay it's

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,950
actually a good thing now we've talked a

00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,000
lot about the goal of where we want to

00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,260
be talked about where you are so what

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,640
are the next steps for getting down the

00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,550
path personally I think this works sort

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,890
of like a mental transformation okay

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,960
when your developer you're listening to

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,410
the architect the architect listens to

00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,270
he takes technical concepts from you

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,520
puts them together and says okay here's

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,550
the plan you take your part of the plan

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,430
you go do the work pretty easy it's easy

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,500
to understand architecture flips that on

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,500
its head and says now you need to listen

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,170
to people and you need to think of a

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,780
plan and then you need to work with very

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,790
smart people to make it happen so

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,110
it's a transformation it's something

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,770
that you have to get accustomed to and

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,870
is something you have to become

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:45,610
comfortable with that's how we're free

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:47,680
and let you know right now I'm label

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,990
drupal developer I am NOT architect but

00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,970
I'm doing an architect's job my job

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,340
right now and I'm looking backwards and

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,590
I'm seeing the things that took to get

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,140
to the point where I'm at you know I had

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,940
this job I had that mentor I got this

00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,670
bit of experience I went through this

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,650
horrendous bad deal and you get to this

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:10,990
point where I've said you look back and

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:13,210
you realize I've become this thing that

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:19,300
I did not expect I was going to be and

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:21,490
that's where I'm at so you know traits

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,870
you get a few these traits you put them

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,490
together you get the mental

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,410
transformation that happens that makes

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:32,880
you to the person that could be a Drupal

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:32,880
architect more water

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,970
I'll probably go through three bottles

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:42,820
standing up here in the network there's

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,870
new work so what are the traits of an

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,490
architect let's go back to the

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,760
definition came up with and take a look

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,919
drupal expert to me this says one thing

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,100
experience lots of experience i'm going

00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,230
to say that again experience that is the

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,909
key like really the key to being a

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,690
triple architect is getting the right

00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:04,000
experience sega one can develop or

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,270
devise a plan to do this i believe

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,190
someone has to be creative so creativity

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,320
it's in there talk about why i put

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,909
curiosity in there in a minute and then

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,260
they can communicate the plan pretty

00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:16,360
obviously this means they need to be

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,679
able to communicate so outside of

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,110
experience which covers the first point

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,149
I see soft skills as being all the rest

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,399
you need to make practically an

00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,960
innovative creative plans that are good

00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,309
for your clients particular needs you

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,169
need to dig to find out what those needs

00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,010
are after that you need to communicate

00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:35,649
the plan and sometimes you can sell it

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:39,840
so the road involves creativity

00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:42,490
curiosity confidence communication

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,750
there's much more you can learn beyond

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,330
that you're going to go to industry

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,490
specific knowledge general software

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,600
architecture knowledge a lot more

00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,340
there's a lot more to learn there's

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,549
always more to learn this is a good

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,549
start

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,780
I'll let you take that one in for a

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,780
minute

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,340
at the top of the topic of experience

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,600
out it isn't a personality trait or a

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,460
soft skill like the rest but it is a

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,230
requirement in fact bearing all else

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,409
this one do more for you than all the

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:16,309
others put together one of the videos i

00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:17,629
was watching by neil ford on software

00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,429
architecture he said a software

00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:21,409
architect is someone who has been in

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:24,980
enough bad projects to know when when

00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:29,179
they see it and it's funny right but it

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,590
sounds true and it really is if you want

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,990
to be a good Drupal architect you're

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,570
going to have to have experience and ski

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,850
so because it's key you want to get the

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,029
right kind I have some suggestions on

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:46,669
that first where a lot of different hats

00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:48,409
I mean do do work in every kind every

00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:52,490
part of the UH Drupal project that you

00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:55,009
can get your hands on ya do themes build

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:58,220
a module do a core patch do

00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:03,049
documentation do everything you can

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:06,110
touch it all the it really helps that

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,850
whole problem of every solution is a

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,570
hammer because every problem is a nail

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:15,559
it the more you get well rounded the

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:18,500
less that problem occurs next if you get

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:23,419
the opportunity work on big or bigger

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:25,549
sites it's true that on smaller site

00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:28,519
builds there often isn't a need for an

00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,500
architect because complex business needs

00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,970
are what usually drive the complex

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,580
technical solutions that require

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,960
somebody to architect so if you can and

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,960
this usually happens after getting a

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,789
little bit of experience back to that

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,919
get on bigger and bigger sites if you

00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,720
can staying with smaller sites it's

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,059
easier especially if your small business

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,550
like you're an independent developer or

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,190
a con

00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,840
factor but if you can start contracting

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,140
for bigger companies or if you can get

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,300
jobs working on bigger projects do so

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,100
really really really really helpful you

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,080
get a lot more variety of the solutions

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:09,180
that you get exposed to and it gives you

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,860
a better base to build from I've had the

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,360
opportunity to work on lots and lots of

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,630
different projects when I was working at

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,430
palantir they had just a plethora of

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:23,460
different clients I were to blow a bot I

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:26,640
worked with form one and Congress guy

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,140
just basically everybody but the

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,130
diversity was great because it gave me

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,780
an experience in different industries

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,780
and different sized projects

00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,600
then after all that we got an

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,840
opportunity to work on nbcnews.com that

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,580
was fun thanks to Seth grounded all

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,950
about forgetting me that gig that was

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,570
really cool while I was there I got to

00:22:51,950 --> 00:23:01,670
take part in the construction of this

00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:04,490
multi-level profile sight base install

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:08,120
profile that we then used as the

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:11,090
headless part of today calm nbcnews.com

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,400
and a variety of other things it wasn't

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,350
the same architecture is Drupal it used

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,230
a completely different architecture it

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:22,280
was headless it uses a queuing system

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,720
yet the team was vastly distributed the

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,910
team was almost as complicated as the

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,620
project I I can't tell you how much I

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,350
learned on that the architect of that

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,540
system was Chris Poochie and he's here

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,230
at the con I'm not sure if he's here but

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,550
that guy is brilliant I mean the people

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,700
that you get to work with the mentors

00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:44,300
that you get are by far your biggest

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:47,450
resource so that's number three work

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,280
with great people if you manage to get

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
your way in there don't squander that

00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,870
resource mentors you're huge Clara

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,500
Garfield right here just get over here

00:23:53,870 --> 00:24:00,170
one of my first mentors honest a great

00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,220
guy don't know how many you can actually

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:05,080
work then but

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,509
here is right here get him up for

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,409
information you know it's exciting it's

00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:18,970
really complicated and I learned so much

00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:23,440
there yeah experience more than just

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,999
Drupal stuff so what I mean by this is

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,990
trying experience of the business side

00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:30,340
of things try and let's say your project

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,840
manager calls out sick and you've been

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,779
attending the project management

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,840
meetings for three months offer to fill

00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:39,999
in try it too if you're scrum master

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
says I got a meeting conflict I'm not

00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:43,480
gonna be able to make it this morning

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,749
say hey mind if I get my hand at that

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,309
it's not impossible it's not even all

00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:51,340
that difficult and it's really helpful

00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:56,740
it helps you understand the other side

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:59,590
of the problem do anything you can on

00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:03,700
the software side of things a couple of

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:05,499
the other things documentation if you

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,899
can get the opportunity well I'll just

00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:11,320
say this drupal architects architects in

00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:12,850
general if you can make a plan it's

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,730
worthless if you can't communicate it

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,470
and so and it's all well and good to

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,110
stand in front of a crowd and talk about

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,690
it but if you can't document it it can't

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,950
be distributed it can't be referred to

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,629
and if you're not there to answer the

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,570
questions nobody can figure out what

00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:31,230
you're doing so learn to document learn

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,230
to document well

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:40,030
another thing estimation I'll say that

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,290
while i was at palantir estimating was

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,720
probably the task that helped me

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:50,080
understand how many important details

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:51,610
there are to a large site build and how

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,620
to come up with same assumptions for

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,620
things that you don't have knowledge on

00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:59,049
so then how to write out all this

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,450
assumptions there's probably no better

00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:03,520
tool I can think of to really understand

00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,040
the breadth of the Drupal project than

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,770
having to estimate it out I mean all the

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,750
way down to the field level thinking of

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:14,950
it ahead of time so you can figure out

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:19,090
how much to charge the client Tiffany

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:21,160
had me do that a lot and it was it was

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:25,590
by far the best training I think a

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:30,840
budding architect could possibly have so

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:30,840
if you get the opportunity try that out

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,809
higher dimension project management so

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:39,940
I'll just skip down there so the first

00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:44,710
trait that i mentioned beyond experience

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:47,110
was curiosity everyone knows that well i

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,559
was gonna architects need to keep up

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,720
with trends in technology software

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,460
architects need to keep up with quite a

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,690
breadth of trends drupal architects me

00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,220
to keep up with the breadth of trends

00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:01,059
and then everything else that's going on

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,260
in drupal as well explain a little bit

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,010
more in the next section but the gist is

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:08,679
that you can be a lot more creative with

00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,990
the solutions that you're making if you

00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,650
have a larger base of knowledge to draw

00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,520
from

00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,710
curiosity helps expand that base of

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,270
knowledge the thing about curiosity is

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,880
that once you have developed the trade

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,800
of curiosity it'll help every aspect of

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,080
your life not just making better

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,180
solutions but if you become curious

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,650
you'll have a more open mind and you'll

00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,940
find yourself be more observant as well

00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,200
making it easier to be creative that's

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,620
great but you know how do you make

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,120
yourself curious I found there's a

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,640
couple things you can do what a minister

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,500
following your interests I like all

00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,640
those newsletters that are always come

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,200
into your inbox you're trying to have

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
subscribed from you can't keep up

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,910
actually follow a link or two in those

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,920
look through see if something interests

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,920
you if it does click it go read

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,000
when you do this what you're doing is

00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,910
you're opening up new avenues in your

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,710
mind new ways of thinking and you're

00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:10,170
bringing a fresh perspective to the

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:14,220
things that you do by having ingested

00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:18,300
more breadth of knowledge into your

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,590
mouth the next thing I shall let me see

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,600
if I can clarify sense a little bit

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:27,420
because I totally didn't write that rain

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,160
when you bring in when you when you

00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,760
chase down things it go off on tangents

00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:37,860
and you start really learning to be

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,870
curious you expand that knowledge of the

00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,760
things you don't know you don't know and

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,730
you turn that into things you know you

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,190
don't know i'm not sure what that's

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,020
called donald rumsfeld headset it years

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,370
and years ago but there's like three

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,050
levels there's all the things you don't

00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,760
know you don't know then within that

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,350
there's the things you are above that

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,700
there's the things you know you don't

00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:01,290
know and then there's the things you

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:03,420
know right this is taking the world

00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:04,590
which is a vast circle with all the

00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,510
things you don't know you don't know on

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,430
reducing that a little bit and giving

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,710
you a little bit bigger circle of things

00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,760
you know you don't know and a little bit

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,480
bigger circle of things you actually

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,990
know and from that you can actually

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,130
build solutions so and now don't stop

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,820
being curious it really does help with

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,780
creativity which is the next section

00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:29,850
this is where I start getting a little

00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:32,190
bit fun in our definition curiosity was

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,030
not really even mentioned but without it

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,580
creativity is a heck of a lot harder so

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:41,390
we kind of build on that so creativity

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,250
is the ability to imagine solutions or

00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,730
start thinking up new ideas and it's a

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:49,590
process that's sort of similar to Legos

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,600
follow along here so you have a bin of

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,400
Legos and you have like it's a really

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,870
basic set you've got some little four

00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,640
pieces and some six pieces and some

00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:59,680
eight pieces maybe a platforms for roof

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:07,640
tiles what are going to build with that

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:09,350
anybody not really you're probably going

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,450
to think of something like a little

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,070
building you don't have a lot of options

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,950
you're working within your constraints

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:18,400
you have the tools to make a little

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:22,040
house probably gonna make a little house

00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,590
so now imagine you have some more legos

00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,910
you have some wheels and you have some

00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,130
windshield parts and you have some

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,560
angled parts and some slick pieces what

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,280
are you going to build after that

00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,450
obviously it's going to get a little bit

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,440
more complicated but you already know

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,580
what you're going to build you're

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,340
working within your constraints you're

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:41,450
probably gonna build a car so the

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:45,920
available materials really does help to

00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:47,810
shape what you think of so expanding

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,120
your available materials really does

00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:53,630
give you the better opportunity to build

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,300
better solutions and this is why the

00:30:53,630 --> 00:31:01,100
previous part of curiosity basically

00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:02,390
gives you a bigger lego man now when

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,870
you're always digging around the web in

00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:07,460
the giant Lego box of technology you're

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,650
seeing all the new call cool JavaScript

00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,690
libraries or your you know listening to

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:15,230
lil avaaz module Monday and going oh

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,820
cool fences or whatever you're just

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,440
making a bigger and bigger bin but that

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,350
doesn't actually help you think of

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,820
better ways to build different things

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:26,120
with all those pieces you might still

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:29,830
just keep building cars and houses so at

00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:32,900
this point how do you get beyond that

00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:36,260
you have to build creativity you have to

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,759
enhance it and basically you do this by

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,340
practicing

00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:44,230
there's an author named James o teacher

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,309
and he recommends a simple program that

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:50,289
he calls exercising your idea muscle now

00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:52,120
he calls it a skill and I agree with

00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:53,679
them it's not a special talent

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,470
creativity is not something that's

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,409
bestowed on just you it's not given to

00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:01,029
just you we we all have it we usually

00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:04,330
wear something out of it but we all have

00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:08,259
it and the way to get more creative is

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,789
to just start using it more often just

00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:13,950
like practicing a piano you will

00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:13,950
eventually get better if you keep trying

00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,950
the program that he has is super simple

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:24,119
it basically it boils down to exercise

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,679
your creativity daily doodle of doodle

00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,539
trying to whistle a new song take a bit

00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,440
of code and make it beautiful do

00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:33,879
something every day now you get to

00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,799
decide whether it's creative or not and

00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:38,350
I suggest you go easy on yourself

00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:41,499
because you know why not it's the

00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:45,960
practice that matters the way he

00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:51,629
suggests that i use is a pretty simple

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:54,159
program of writing down ten ideas daily

00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:55,090
I'll vouch for this one by the way has

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,220
definitely helped me become more

00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:59,230
creative that's made it so that when I

00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:03,759
need to in a pinch come up with an idea

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:08,249
I can pretty quickly so if you need a

00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:10,809
good starter well give it some ten ideas

00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:13,119
so here's just one that I wrote up all

00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:14,470
of this writing this document but ten

00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,169
modules I'd make of course that was the

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,669
first one I think of I don't know why 10

00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:22,210
really weird names I could name my kids

00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:24,369
I got three if I could go on forever on

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,649
that one ten movies that love to see

00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:29,080
made ten reasons why the original doom

00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:31,059
book was the best 10 characters that

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,269
would have been way better than Jar Jar

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:36,700
Binks 10 things i can do to improve my

00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:39,610
health 10 things i can do to improve my

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:43,240
mood 10 new things i want to learn

00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:46,830
drupal 10 special cats i would love to

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,630
she and Nico to me anybody play that

00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:51,460
it's okay you can admit it if you get

00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,860
bored you can check your cats see if

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,770
Tubbs has been there 10 apps i want to

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,570
make for my smartwatch and then i went

00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,870
made one it was that Deadpool apt c1

00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:04,600
Deadpool was though it's out on Pelton

00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,720
market it's fun it's a creative team

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,710
practice now practice only works if you

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:14,950
do it and consistency is the key on this

00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,560
you have to do it daily the he says and

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:20,169
I agree with them your creativity muscle

00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,700
will atrophy if you stop and then you

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:26,889
have do it all over again you have to

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:28,929
keep at it go simple on this they get

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,730
harder it does actually get harder to

00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,840
come up with ten lists every day after

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,450
about a week you're going to just not

00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:38,369
even know what theme to stick to that's

00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:38,369
why I did like a 10 list of 10 lists

00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:43,139
after getting some experience actually

00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:58,130
so after you get some experience and you

00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:00,080
develop creativity and curiosity you'll

00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,520
probably have a pretty good-sized Lego

00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,200
bin from which to build your solutions

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,670
and you'll be able to think of better

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,340
solutions to build from them more easily

00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:12,890
once you've done that you actually need

00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,000
to present those solutions and sometimes

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,500
you have to actually sell those

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,950
solutions to people for them to actually

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,950
get used and this takes confidence now

00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:29,800
did anybody see Dan Lin's presentation

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,880
downstairs like just about an hour ago

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,760
so everybody know about impostor

00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,840
syndrome won't you just skip over this

00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,020
part because I can get through this

00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,670
pretty quick or are there actual let's

00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:44,900
flip that around anybody want me to go

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:47,050
over impostor syndrome okay let's do

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,050
that

00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,420
now one thing about imposter syndrome

00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,680
statistic i just read said seventy

00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,349
percent or maybe it was out of danland

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,349
slides i'm not sure seventy percent of

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:03,849
us actually experience imposter syndrome

00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:05,980
and you you can bet i'm experiencing

00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:08,880
that right now i'm a drupal developer

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:13,180
telling you guys how to be an architect

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:16,839
yeah anyhow yeah imposter sounds very

00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:20,250
real but it's not it's not an impossible

00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:22,480
thing to deal with for the most part

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:26,500
there's some pretty easy steps you can

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:31,119
do to make yourself not feel quite so

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:33,400
imposter ish i'll just briefly go over

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,410
these and explain them just a bit

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,150
because i can already see i'm going to

00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:41,650
go over in time but briefly first know

00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,140
that you're experiencing it seriously

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,609
seventy percent of us that's like all of

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,950
that side of the room not this site you

00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:49,660
guys good all of that side of the room

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:53,380
is an imposter how do you feel about

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,549
that yeah seventy percent know that

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,559
you're experiencing it and that it's a

00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:59,650
real thing and that you're not probably

00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:03,670
actually an imposter on your successes

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:06,369
when you do something right know that

00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,490
you did that right inside know it was

00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:11,650
you not you didn't copy and paste that

00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,359
office oh well maybe you did but /

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,089
that's great but but you put that

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,619
solution together right stop thinking

00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:20,589
that there's such a thing as perfect

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,750
okay that's the big one always comparing

00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:27,250
yourself against this perfect ideal of

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:28,599
what should be nobody's perfect there's

00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,240
not a single person in this room is

00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:31,520
perfect

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,220
know that you don't know everything and

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,660
accept that okay that's pretty much what

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:40,700
Google's for isn't it yeah so keep track

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,710
of your successes and publish that blog

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,960
about it tweet them when you do

00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:47,750
something that's really really cool and

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,630
you tweet it and somebody who you

00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,869
thought so super smarter than you says

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,760
oh that's cool i didn't know that it's

00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:59,690
pretty validating and it happens all the

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,630
time and quit being afraid of being

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,760
found out especially in this community I

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,100
can't tell this community loves newbies

00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,780
okay I when I started out and I was

00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:13,010
trying to was running my own development

00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:16,310
shop Angie Byron said to me no no no no

00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:18,800
no we need you as a beginner because we

00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:20,480
need to document how this works from a

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,830
beginner's viewpoint it's the only place

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,090
I've ever been aware being a beginner

00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:31,940
was a benefit so especially here love

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:34,190
being not perfect okay and and be open

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,980
about it and we that's just how this

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:38,510
community works and if it wasn't here I

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,040
probably wouldn't even be standing up

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,310
here I wouldn't be presenting because

00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:49,010
this community helped me get past that

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:50,330
so we love you outside of imposter

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,000
syndrome I have some other tips for

00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:55,250
confidence in general first of these is

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,320
fitness a lot of people might know I

00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,950
hear this but fitness is huge it's

00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,430
really big for me it seems to be working

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,430
for him

00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:09,290
you know I had shoulder pain for well

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,560
I've had shoulder pain for probably

00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:14,600
about 13 years now I played football in

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,070
high school I'd be my shoulders up a lot

00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,410
and then sitting in front of a computer

00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:21,410
for decades kind of made all the muscles

00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,670
go away let my shoulder start her and so

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,190
I decided to do something about that I

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,430
start working out excited I liked it and

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:33,260
start seeing benefits from having

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:35,390
exercised when I did this I realized

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,650
that my brain was working better as

00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,300
being more productive every time it

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,960
worked out I'd get a euphoria feeling

00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,310
and then I'd come back because I luckily

00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,540
I got to work from home and I kind of

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,590
get set my own schedule so I could work

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,840
out the middle the day and I come back

00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:54,110
and my afternoons wait more productive

00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:58,760
than my mornings having done that I can

00:39:54,110 --> 00:40:01,610
I moved from being obese I was 264

00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,000
pounds I came down and to normal after

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:08,240
about three months so i went from 264

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,750
down to 231 and then I started lifting

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,800
weights and i went from 231 to 231 but I

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:18,220
went from obese down to overweight down

00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,220
tomorrow

00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:26,880
and I realized that sitting at my

00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,089
computer wasn't going to help me live

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,160
longer it certainly wasn't going to make

00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:34,710
it so that I could see my kids

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,579
grandchildren or my kids children my own

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,690
grandchildren for as long I wasn't gonna

00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,039
be able to go and experience things with

00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,190
my wife after our kids are grown and

00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:47,039
left because we'd be if I felt like I

00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:51,690
had felt every morning I just I did I

00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:53,910
didn't want to do anything so also my

00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,680
wife pointed out that we both aren't

00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,210
getting any more time every day hobbies

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,559
eat up time so if we wanted to

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,710
accomplish more we're going to have to

00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:06,059
make more of ourselves so I made an

00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:09,269
audacious goal and I said that I want to

00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:11,430
compete in the 40 and over bodybuilding

00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:14,039
competition next year in my home state

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,539
of Idaho so if anybody knows what that's

00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:18,569
about you know how much work as anime

00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:21,059
and if you don't then that means I'm

00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:23,609
going to be standing in front of a very

00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:24,930
large audience in a bikini trying to

00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,799
look like Arnold Schwarzenegger from

00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:31,910
terminator it makes presenting to this

00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:31,910
audience not seem all that big of a deal

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:40,390
so that's the front ready to embarrass

00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:43,299
my kids a lot it's kind of fun

00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:45,220
so anyhow even if I don't manage to do

00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:47,140
that even if I don't qualify for

00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,450
competing I'm still going to be like

00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,839
seven billion times better off than I am

00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:54,549
right now right it well and I'm not

00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:56,440
doing too bad right now either I mean I

00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:59,549
seriously I 140 bistra normal and that

00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:05,279
only took three months so no matter what

00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:08,829
it's going to work and I highly import

00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:11,650
do fads that crap does not work move

00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:15,190
your body more just try and get up and

00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:18,390
do more with yourself it's catchy it

00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:22,480
actually works and it changes your life

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:24,819
so apparently c HX had mentioned that

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,740
somebody had been trying to get a Drupal

00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:29,079
Fitness phenomenon going and hadn't

00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,880
caught on i'm probably going to pick up

00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,589
that mantle and actually see if i can't

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,769
get it to catch on because it matters

00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:38,230
are our community probably one of the

00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:40,390
more fit technology communities that

00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,210
i've seen wandering about different tech

00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:46,619
centers but we can all do better and we

00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,619
can all improve our lives

00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:54,180
she's still there he's still there

00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:01,890
what if you need the benefits of say an

00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,800
exercise that that that endorphins

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:08,990
feeling you know the lower cortisol this

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,810
will do it for you there's a TED talk by

00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:14,880
what's your name Amy Cuddy look it up

00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,240
it'll be in the resources at the end

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,430
about about body hacks confidence hacks

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,890
using your body power goes just standing

00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,320
here for two minutes you get a powerful

00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:27,060
position will actually increase your

00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,560
endorphins and lower your cortisol and

00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,340
make you I did it right before the

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,720
session actually was brandy

00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,880
scientifically speaking it hatcher minh

00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,300
your body into thinking that you're more

00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,370
confident and you are more confident so

00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,360
give it a try if you have a meeting or

00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,600
something that you're going to nervous

00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:48,810
about now let's get back on to

00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:51,180
communication this was sort of a

00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:53,040
combination of things track the like

00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,960
technical transit translation between

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,860
like the business world and the tech

00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,120
world diplomacy salesmanship nowadays in

00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,450
my position at the Forest Service they

00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,710
get to work with this one a lot more

00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:06,690
there's enter Department relationships

00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,060
there's politically hot topics I have to

00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:11,970
avoid lots of stakeholders that I have

00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:14,850
to convince and sell actually before I

00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,110
go on to that I want to discuss

00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,730
something that I think might even be

00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,500
more important and that's finding the

00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,290
actual need of your customer so i'm

00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,680
going to hop to this one rule it's more

00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,970
important we might run out of time so

00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,160
customers often don't know what they

00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,840
need and when they're discussing things

00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,310
sometimes they're telling you about the

00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,820
things they want or something cool they

00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:37,560
saw that or maybe they know something

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,450
they can't really articulate it and this

00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,910
is the place where i think we as

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:45,270
solution people can be a lot more

00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:47,310
helpful first find out what they want

00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:50,220
you you can do that by helping them to

00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:52,620
describe it as user story with actual

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,910
numbers and if they're not using numbers

00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,970
if that they're not using definite terms

00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,740
help them to quantify often the customer

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,960
will give you a vague feely sorts of

00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:05,470
words like like flexible or maintainable

00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,180
or fast or inexpensive you can't use

00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:11,890
those that's not there's not a

00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:13,089
definition around fast if you leave your

00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,960
requirements like that your developers

00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:16,030
don't have what they need to build

00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,039
solutions and this is good for us at any

00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,630
point we can help dig for those

00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,359
solutions even if we are just developers

00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:24,039
so and at the end you will have anything

00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:27,670
to go on to know if you've gotten your

00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:31,089
task done so there was a fantastic

00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,890
example by Keith Braithwaite in the book

00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:35,349
called 97 things ever chef or software

00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,910
architects should know and it was must

00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:38,410
respond to user input no more than

00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,640
fifteen hundred milliseconds under

00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,859
normal load defined as the average

00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,539
response time between 750 and 550

00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:45,160
milliseconds response times less than

00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:46,180
500 milliseconds can't be distinguished

00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,980
by the user so we're not going to pay

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,109
for that that's that's a real

00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:53,349
requirement okay when we're getting

00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:56,559
stuff like the user experience needs to

00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:58,410
be better and you know the users have to

00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,089
be able to do this thing more quickly

00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,490
that's not going to define well enough

00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:09,579
to make tasks and user stories from so

00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:11,109
really help your customers quantify the

00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:14,589
questions you can ask to get through

00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:18,580
that is how fast how many how much ask

00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:20,440
the questions get the quantified answers

00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:24,160
if they're still having trouble with

00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,320
that you might be able to use the tool

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:32,940
the five wise is anybody familiar with

00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,940
this one like three people all right

00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,920
five ways of the methodology was created

00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:42,340
by Toyota during one of their

00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,540
reinventions and basically it's just a

00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:48,130
good way to get to the bottom of any

00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:50,200
problem here's a example off of

00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,020
Wikipedia there's a really big problem

00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,000
the battery's dead why well the

00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,490
alternator's not functioning okay why

00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,030
well the alternator belts broken okay

00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:02,260
why well it was worn out beyond its

00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,120
useful service life have not replaced

00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,400
oky the vehicle was not maintained

00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:09,580
according to its maintenance schedule

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,140
that's the route now you can use this

00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,550
problem just about or you can use this

00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:17,620
this why that's digging why why why

00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:20,890
solution finder and just about anything

00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:23,140
and I can bet you can imagine plenty of

00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:25,000
scenarios that we're drupal's cash

00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,540
hasn't been cleared is the third or

00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,320
fourth why

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:34,930
happens every time so now let's get back

00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:39,940
to the communication part we are pretty

00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:41,530
much almost out of time actually so in

00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,510
all my previous roles have been fairly

00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:45,370
technical minded I I spoke Drupal to

00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,380
people people spoke Drupal back to me

00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:49,120
and that was pretty much the job my

00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:53,350
current role I don't get to speak

00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,760
technically like I'll talk about how our

00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,650
department can support and facilitate

00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,200
other departments and sell on how

00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,210
necessary we aren't convinced them how

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,800
our product can reduce dreams on wet

00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,900
budgets while simultaneously increasing

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,250
time utilization for content entry of

00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,730
course you know i'm talking about

00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,440
creating a base profile right that's it

00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:13,270
but that's not how you talk to them you

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,220
don't say I'm creating a base profile

00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,290
with base theme based on bootstrap and

00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,280
we're going to you they're just going to

00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:24,670
look at you like you're all looking at

00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:26,560
me right now so we can't talk like that

00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,450
when we get to this point we really have

00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,750
to start talking about things like needs

00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:34,960
and desires and budgets and you know

00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:36,490
documents and helping and support these

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,230
are the words that you talk back to them

00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:42,580
that's the language that they're

00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:44,980
speaking and I don't really have a

00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,590
suggestion on how to how to accommodate

00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,870
that other than learning your business

00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,520
side of things such as if you're in the

00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,630
medical industry learning the medical

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,880
business if you're in government

00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:57,820
learning your acronyms if you're in

00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,940
insurance learning that language you

00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:03,280
learn their language and start using it

00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,510
and the more and better you do that the

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,050
more of a benefit you're going to be to

00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,050
your customer

00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,470
they should I'll just say it this way

00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:15,190
they should never have to learn our

00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:20,140
language okay ever no customers should

00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:21,670
have to learn drupal to talk to us so

00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,800
once you start talking their language

00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,110
you might often have to do it in a

00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:30,610
persuasive manner I love this one this

00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:32,020
is by Jeffy this is what I call

00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,670
salesmanship because often you don't you

00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:38,320
have to sell your problem or your

00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:40,210
solution or yourself to to get the

00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,060
solution that you know they need into

00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,250
their hands I'm only going to make one

00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:47,230
point in this and that's that you don't

00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,600
sell features you sell benefits when

00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,670
you're talking to them you tell them how

00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,250
it will help them you do not tell them

00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:56,770
what it will do they don't care about

00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:58,390
the workflow module they don't they

00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,940
don't care about occupy they care about

00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:04,350
faster response times and how their

00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:07,720
editors can contribute content safely

00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:11,340
talk solutions talk benefits do not talk

00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:15,540
or don't talk solutions talk benefits

00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,540
I'm going to skip right on through here

00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:22,030
trust your team were completely at a

00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,420
time I think oh no we're at 50 minutes

00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:27,100
no we're good okay so now you're this

00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,590
bigger person when you get to be the

00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,300
architect you're going to have a higher

00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:32,950
stakes position you're going to have a

00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,040
higher profile position it's going to be

00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,840
one where it makes you feel like I

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:43,150
really need to get this done I must make

00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:46,110
this happen now you get there you don't

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,580
solve problems by telling everybody to

00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,270
yeah can you work on sunday we need that

00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:52,250
TPS report you don't do that

00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,890
you do that by surrounding yourself by

00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:58,400
extremely smart people and listening to

00:50:54,890 --> 00:51:01,700
them and having them help you solve

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,590
problems and then trusting them when you

00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,880
give them the work to do and then

00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:15,430
crediting them when they've done it well

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:17,720
that's a really short synopsis thank you

00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:19,880
the whole credit thing is really really

00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,130
cool because then it shows your customer

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,540
that you've got a tool rather than just

00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:29,900
a bunch of people that are costing them

00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:32,120
money they like that I sped right

00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,720
through that good deal so here's some of

00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:37,760
the resources that I've been looking at

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,500
now I'll tell you I got a lot out of a

00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,730
couple of these I didn't get so much out

00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,770
of the other ones because it got bogged

00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,680
down it's going to understand them the

00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,450
first one O'Reilly software architecture

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,820
fundamentals video series that was

00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:52,220
awesome they're kind of boring to listen

00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,770
to but they're a good good video

00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:57,500
presentation on the broader terms of

00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:58,960
software architecture and getting you to

00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,540
understand what that world's all about

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:06,730
the next one Amy Cuddy is 20 minute talk

00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:09,650
on body hacks definitely watch that it's

00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:11,450
it's really fascinating and it'll really

00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:15,680
help you in case you ever have to get

00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:17,750
here 97 things every software architect

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,420
should know really quick ebook it's on

00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:22,580
these websites good one software

00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,900
architecture software system and our

00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,060
church you're working with stakeholders

00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,710
and viewpoints and perspectives I'm

00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,390
bogged down in that one I bogged down an

00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,150
excellent too although they're both

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:34,700
suppose were really good software

00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:36,140
architecture practice and then of course

00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,180
you get down to the blog of James L to

00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,430
chur this guy interviews everybody by

00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,410
the way if you get a chance to go read

00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:43,550
his blog you'll be fascinating he's some

00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,740
of the people he's interviewed and

00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,260
gotten bits of wisdom from her it's

00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,100
possible and then success principles how

00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,570
to get from where you are and where you

00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,040
want to be by jack canfield together at

00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:55,410
the Chicken Soup for the Soul series of

00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:58,380
books you wrote this book too

00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:01,410
literally changed my life good book so

00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,819
here's some things that some of my

00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,190
friends have tweeted at me when I

00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:09,569
implored them to please tell me how to

00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:14,869
be an architect please you can think

00:53:09,569 --> 00:53:17,400
this guy for that one this one says

00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:18,869
architectures where soft skills and tech

00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:24,869
skills meet fornicate and produce a

00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:26,730
bouncing baby product thanks Larry next

00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,900
one is a lesson doodles remember the

00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,640
scottie principle and estimating this

00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,450
one I talked about with d multiplying by

00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,890
a factor of Josh browser says seek first

00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:36,599
to understand the problem you asked to

00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:40,530
solve Israeli the problem the client

00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:42,030
wants to solve Larry had another one

00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,890
your job is to figure out how to make

00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:46,799
your dev team bored not needing any

00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,599
custom code Zen doodles had another one

00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:50,039
when defining requirements negotiate for

00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,750
the ninety-five percent solution you can

00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:53,520
do with five percent of the effort I

00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,380
like that one I didn't really mention

00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,349
that in the thing because it's pretty

00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,960
well summarized right there Larry here

00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:04,049
says sometimes Larry you're like all

00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,849
over this sometimes a small change to

00:54:04,049 --> 00:54:08,160
the design can save 40 hours of work

00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:12,000
your job is to help the client make an

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,220
informed call on that next learn oh yeah

00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,529
bro miles guy who wrote views and chaos

00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,150
tools might know something learn the

00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:20,010
drip away but don't be slavish to it

00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,380
it's not the right it's not always right

00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,210
sometimes it's just history and it's

00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,059
changing a lot I'll anyhow going into

00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,740
Drupal 8 so he's very right on that

00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:31,559
Larry said something similar go with the

00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,670
grain Drupal has a very strong green to

00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,579
write more often than you think but not

00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,049
always Damian McKenna said working with

00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:39,089
Pete work with PMS to get a better

00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:42,690
handle on estimating I covered that

00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:44,160
pretty well c HX said experience is i

00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,670
have already made the mistake you're

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,670
about to make

00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,530
put the nuclear bomb behind that one too

00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:55,270
it works Josh Grover on hiring people

00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,620
far more qualified themselves his goal

00:54:55,270 --> 00:55:08,730
is always to be the dumbest guy in the

00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:08,730
room so any questions that works

00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:24,869
seriously you guys actually get to walk

00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:28,599
around a little bit now enjoy some error

00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:31,200
we got out early thanks for the applause

00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:31,200
