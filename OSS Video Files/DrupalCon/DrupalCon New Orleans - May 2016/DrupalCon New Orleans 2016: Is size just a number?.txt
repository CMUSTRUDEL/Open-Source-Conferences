Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Is size just a number?
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Drupal has one of the largest open source communities in the world, with Drupal 8 crediting over 3,000 individual contributors. With this many people involved Drupal can do anything, right? Well, maybe this number isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

Let’s discuss challenges we face having such a large community. Are the processes around the Drupal project equipped to handle such a large number of contributors? Do we still experience growing pains? What problems are hidden by that large number, like the limited number high-end contributors and burnout. Does it even make sense to strive for bigger numbers in all aspects of the community?

Let’s also discuss ways we might shift our focus, like supporting smaller, more productive events, one-on-one mentoring programs to help nurture existing contributors, and other ways to make sure we get the most out of our limited volunteer hours and efforts.

hi everyone who came to my core

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:16,859
conversation on community stuff so what

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:21,420
are we here to talk about today yes

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:26,400
there is Kathy we're very casual on the

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,070
core conversation area so I wanted to

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,619
talk today about stuff that goes on the

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,239
community related to the size of the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,840
community the growth that we've been

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:41,280
undergoing the mentoring system

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,070
processes all that related I think

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,450
that's something that we really should

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,910
analyze much more than we currently do

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,250
because fundamentally Drupal has grown

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,460
so much and will continue hopefully to

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,100
keep growing but there's some signs I

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,280
think of some unhealthy things that

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,690
might be going on and we should really

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,280
take a look at that on a regular basis

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,049
year by year and see if there's ways

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,250
that we can improve and you know things

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,630
that we care about should we care about

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,010
them as much as we do should we be

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,659
caring about other things you know are

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,280
these some things good or they bad or

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,549
whatever so a little bit about me I'm

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,900
David Hernandez I work for FF W the

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,040
manager of learning and contributions

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,020
there so my role specifically is all

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,650
about internal learning education

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,900
training mentoring I'm also community

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,540
liaison I deal with contributions

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,540
everything so this is all very relevant

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,070
to me and something that I'm actually

00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,840
looking at more and more as time goes on

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,799
because it's directly related to my role

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,509
the company again I work for FF W which

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,810
is the world's largest Drupal agency go

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,810
team

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,950
and again this is a core conversation so

00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,110
I should not be the only one talking I

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,360
want to hear from everyone I'm going to

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,979
go over a lot of different things but

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,100
this content is not only about my

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,380
presentation you all have to participate

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,080
so anything that you want to complain

00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,250
about go for it if you have ideas if you

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,440
want to interrupt me while in the middle

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,069
of slides go for it use the mic shout it

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,580
out all of those are fine I definitely

00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:27,980
need you to participate because I don't

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:32,150
have enough slides to go for an hour so

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,910
audience participation is mandatory all

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,870
right so 3,000 strong this is the number

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,459
of that obviously I put in my

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,950
description and something I want to talk

00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:42,140
about because it gets communicated a lot

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,060
as part of the marketing for Drupal of

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,370
hey Drupal 8 as we've gone through

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,140
development we've had over 3000

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,700
contributors we even made a really big

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,350
deal about this when we got to that

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,390
number i remember exactly when it

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,280
happened during gov con last year it was

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,440
like who's going to be the 3000th person

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,630
and it was a really big deal and we even

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,100
gone past that so I think by release

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:07,820
that number was up to 3300 and it's like

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,780
3500 now and that's gigantic Drupal is

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
one of the largest open source

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,579
communities if you go by people

00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,930
participating people contribute and if

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,810
you actually just go by that number it

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,040
may in fact be the largest one just by

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,829
number of people who are actively

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,840
contributing so we're allowed to

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,260
interrupt yes so we have to be careful

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,739
when we say we had 3,000 contributors we

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,530
had 3,000 people with commit credit yes

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:38,030
we had a lot more contributors than that

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:42,230
yes officially credited to an issue that

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,450
got committed to Drupal 8 as opposed to

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,900
someone who might have just see edit and

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,350
documentation on drupal.org or rant you

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,350
heard me

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:59,599
I ran an event spoke at through pecan

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:06,110
like I'm doing now or just speaks at

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:07,910
drupalcon just gives a keynote so let's

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,130
talk about that number a little bit and

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,590
how we got here so there's a lot of

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,790
things that we actively do which is

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,680
really great and things that we're doing

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,880
now and throughout the entire

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,709
development process for Triple Eight

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,930
that we haven't done before one of them

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:25,520
is having this actual official mentoring

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,590
team and mentoring initiatives so if

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,810
you're not familiar we have these weekly

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,210
office hours on IRC where people come by

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,960
and get mentored a lot of this happens

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,610
at events so this friday there is

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,350
mentored sprints that are going on we

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,120
always get lots of people that show up I

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,340
think technically we might even get a

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,660
couple hundred people that show up her

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:50,479
first time contributor is at every

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:53,060
drupalcon I know that at every camp that

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,610
I'm at I help mentor and at the sprint

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,100
rooms are always seeking out new people

00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,539
to get them to participate and it's a

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,229
really big deal you get your first can

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:05,270
contribute your commit credits and we do

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,280
a lot of that which we doing more than I

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,380
think we've ever done before I think

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,770
there is some cultural change so a lot

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,050
of people who even the same individuals

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,180
who've been contributing in the past who

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,160
you can tell I think in the issue cues

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,690
that they've been much more welcoming to

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,940
new contributors than they were like

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,580
five six years ago because people are

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,289
really understanding the idea that hey

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,200
these are new people who are coming into

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:33,590
the community they want to actively help

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,169
it's a good idea if you like be nice to

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,180
them and write like not yell at them and

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,710
act like a complete jerk to them and

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,280
like oh yeah then they come back and

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,280
they actually help

00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:47,619
yes and there are plenty of open source

00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:49,969
communities who are really bad at it

00:05:47,619 --> 00:05:52,039
that I've even participated in actually

00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:54,529
had to get into arguments of people like

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,929
why are you being a jerk to that person

00:05:54,529 --> 00:06:01,849
and like they argue like it's effective

00:05:56,929 --> 00:06:03,439
being a jerk like no it's not like this

00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:08,330
is how we need out people who can't hack

00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,529
it okay good for you and greater

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,459
communication so yeah we definitely

00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:14,779
promote a lot more so I stole some

00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:17,449
charts I mean well I made one chart

00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:19,969
install a chart if you've never seen us

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,129
before this is the famous Drupal long

00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:25,430
tail that we you know people have heard

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:27,830
of if you've never heard before a long

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,180
tail is this graph where you can see

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,399
obviously this is a ranking of

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,339
contributors and the number of commits

00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,649
credits they have so you can see it's

00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:41,449
significantly the tail extends out for

00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,300
people who only have like one or two

00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,979
actual commit credits and most of the

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:54,229
work is actually just being done by a

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:55,969
small number of people so I made this

00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,529
one so I must have just completely

00:06:55,969 --> 00:07:00,649
copied everything that you did I'm not

00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:03,999
saying that but you'll see in another

00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:07,519
slide that I completely stole that one

00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:09,349
accredited xjm so I was too lazy to redo

00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,659
it for triple-a and you'll notice that

00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,490
hey whoa look at that it's like the

00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:15,499
exact same thing no matter you know we

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,269
did that in Drupal 7 and in Drupal 8 we

00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:20,269
still have this long tail where we have

00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:25,149
so many people who are just mostly doing

00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:25,149
one or two things it's even longer

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,890
yes we have a smaller no I don't think

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:39,610
we really are smaller subscriber well

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:42,820
they're not both the scale there they

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,280
are not so the numbers aren't the same

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,640
in either acts the numbers are longer on

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:53,050
both axes but at the same time also the

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,450
area of like regular repeat the work

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,810
done by repeat consistent contributors

00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:01,750
is a smaller part of the whole compared

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:06,250
to the long tail on the spike by the top

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,480
so it the distribution became start yeah

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,330
but some of that it was also i think

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,480
because there were so many more commits

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:17,620
on eight i think that might be part of

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,660
what's demonstrating that but I have

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,160
some other numbers to talk about so I

00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,300
just wanted to show you these two things

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:28,570
just to demonstrate the fact that it

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,850
hasn't really changed that much but I

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,470
didn't look at the numbers for both use

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,210
Drupal 7 in Drupal 8 and there were some

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,770
interesting not just the numbers but if

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,090
you actually look through that list of

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,180
people there's some really interesting

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:42,099
things that you can take from it one

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,980
thing of so here the numbers so over

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,040
3000 over 3300 now for Drupal 8 and it

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,870
was exactly 954 people for Drupal 7 and

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,200
one interesting thing I noticed that

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,820
both of those lines start to flatten out

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,380
around the two hundredth person and so I

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,880
started looking at all the individual

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,920
people because one of the things we

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,990
always discuss it is a burnout and

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,000
turnover of the people who are

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,470
contributing so I wanted to see what

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,970
that was actually like and I started

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,940
looking through the list of say the top

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,780
10 20 30 50 things like that and i

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,110
thought it was actually kind of

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,810
interesting that it didn't seem like the

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:23,530
turnover was as big as people think it

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,600
is so for example of the top 25 people

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:29,170
10 of them for drupal 8 are still in the

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,890
top 25 from Drupal 7 and other remaining

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:35,520
15 8 or still on top 112 are still a top

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,520
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,660
there were three people who were in the

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,490
top 25 for drupal 7 who were not in the

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,839
top 200 for drupal 8 and i think all

00:09:46,490 --> 00:10:08,610
three of them are still liking the top

00:09:48,839 --> 00:10:10,770
like 400 or something to a degree yes

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,820
there certainly is that but i would i

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,200
would encourage anybody who's really

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,490
interested to actually go look at those

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,910
lists and if you scan the top hundred

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,529
it's still extremely familiar groups so

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,140
an example clarification i think what

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,300
kathy is getting at is that sun for

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,240
example was extremely active in drupal 7

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,380
extremely active in the first half like

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,110
the first two years of your flight

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,640
development fell off the face of the

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,740
earth as far as Drupal's concerned like

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,630
you basically look drupal he continues

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,839
to get issue credits to the state yeah

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,209
in in 81 82 etc because he commented on

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,779
issues five six years ago so there's

00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:50,010
there's an extent to which like the

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:51,540
contributors aren't actually the people

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,980
who are actively working on issues

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:59,040
during that release cycle it's it's like

00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,180
but because of the way we credit issues

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,910
and because of the length of time and

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,290
resolves problems um there was a period

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,940
of time where I wasn't contributing

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,290
patches at all and I continued to get

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,550
more and more issue credits and that

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,560
happens for a lot of people so there's

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,850
that there's to some extent that those

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,650
numbers sure I mean we're going to have

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:18,000
variation when a project takes five

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:19,980
years to complete and that's a problem

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,480
in itself if you were to accurately

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,750
understand who is doing what over what

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,589
time frame let's not take five years to

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,589
have a release

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,040
but the the bigger problem that I think

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:37,910
in even discussing that 3,000 number is

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,160
the fact that yes seventy percent of the

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:44,660
people on Drupal a had only one or two

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:48,459
connect credits which is actually a

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,459
greater number than even vertical seven

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,970
so let's discuss some challenges that I

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:59,060
think exists problems that currently

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,079
exist I know that it's it's been

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,389
discussed a lot with people about

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,139
chocolate work itself and the patch

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:07,910
process and the toolset that's there

00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:11,269
that it's a major barrier for people to

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:15,199
contribute although I think to some

00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:17,750
extent it's not as significant as some

00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,569
people think as far as getting people to

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,800
contribute very actively I don't think

00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,269
that's actually the number one bear I

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,180
think it's a significant barrier to get

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,230
people who are less technical involved

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,110
so if you want people working on

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,300
documentation and UX changes and simple

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,220
like CSS changes that's yet some major

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,370
Barre for somebody who's not a serious

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,680
developer I don't think that's

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,930
necessarily the barrier for somebody

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,279
who's already a high level contributor

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,870
continuing to be a high level

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
contributor when they most of the time

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,810
is not spent dealing with the issue

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,060
queue and patches and things like that

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,189
it's you know the the thing that's

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,410
stopping you from making that 500 killed

00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,850
by patch was not the fact that you had

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,079
to make a pageant upload it it was like

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,529
it was the fact that you had to write

00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,860
the code to do it right on the same

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,750
thing issue could work flow I'm really

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,870
stay stating hear more of a project

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,569
management related issue of like how how

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,430
we deal with the issue queues themselves

00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:14,540
statuses things like that that's

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,130
something that's completely outside the

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,990
tool set I've talked to a lot of new

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,269
contributors who still have confusions

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,250
about that and don't understand that's

00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:24,769
it necessarily just what the statuses

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,180
might say say in documentation like you

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,529
set it to this but I talk to people all

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,920
the time say I don't understand why a

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,750
person set it to that and you know what

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,459
it is that they're actually saying to me

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,410
like is it getting sent back to me like

00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:38,329
they think just says uploading a pageant

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,350
then someone reviews and since back to

00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,040
need work they're like oh and they

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,139
saying they're not going to

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,490
the patch like no they're just sending

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:45,440
it back to you that you might have to do

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,370
something or there might need to be a

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,139
discussion or something I think we need

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,660
to have a like we need to talk about

00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,430
this status I think that might be

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,550
helpful because it's not just needs work

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,250
we're need to review it's like this

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,920
needs more planning or justification you

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,139
know we have some some statuses for that

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,540
but there's definitely it seems like

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:10,190
people who are not culturally in the

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,110
contribution community themselves we're

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,120
new get confused around a lot of that

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,009
sort of process and workflow things that

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,329
are just understood by other people I

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,819
was having conversations with people

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,500
about that directly yesterday that were

00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,670
just like we're off issues and they were

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,170
just like well because they set it back

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,769
to these work or they did something else

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,420
do it like well so like yeah go talk to

00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:33,019
them have a conversation like oh I can't

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,170
do that I think governance we have some

00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,459
new governance policies around

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,769
contributing directly to chorus

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:44,959
specifically about being able to

00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:47,089
escalate conflicts between people and

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,769
their ideas and like up to component

00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:50,779
maintain errs and the cork amid team

00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:52,970
stuff like that I don't know how well

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,860
it's actually actively being used i wish

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,440
there was a better mechanism for doing

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,880
it other than setting tags you're like

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,800
how do we actually get someone's

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,769
attention especially for new

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,480
contributors like if someone's hosting

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,130
something and someone rejects it like

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,170
how does this new person know what the

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,940
process is to get someone's attention to

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,470
get a second opinion essentially like

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,690
there's nothing so those issues just die

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,760
they don't come back to it so that's a

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,260
bit of a problem that ties into conflict

00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,600
resolution how are people dealing with

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,610
these basically about all volunteers and

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,310
many of them have no idea who the other

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,689
people are right if you're a completely

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,910
new person and someone shows up and

00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:30,260
rejects something that you're doing or

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,699
says it's not a good idea you don't even

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:36,079
you know know who these experienced

00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:37,250
contributors are and then we have a

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,930
human component which i think is

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,410
actually one of the most important

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,329
pieces to this yet for a lot of people

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,040
there are language barriers right so how

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:48,589
do they contribute when maybe the

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,630
English isn't their first language and

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,060
there's cultural barriers so even people

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,020
who speak English we

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,760
you know you might have to deal with

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,440
issues where they're from another

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,700
country and there's just all kinds of

00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,230
different cultures people come from

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,030
different places they're used to working

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,290
with people in different ways and you

00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,640
know you're you have an entire

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,750
amalgamation of all these different

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,220
people for coming from different places

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,720
that are volunteering giving their time

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,600
trying to work with each other doing it

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,130
online doing it in IRC doing it

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,540
initially cubes doing all over the place

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,820
and it's you know it's not always an

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,180
easy process and of course time

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,860
management which you know how you how

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,050
can you devote time most of this is

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,360
volunteering so it's very difficult for

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,430
people to get enough time to actually do

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,930
their contributions and I think that's

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,280
part of what leads to burn out some of

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,800
these other problems that we have where

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,450
people are being asked to devote so much

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,130
themselves outside the normal work hours

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,840
if they're not being paid to do it and

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,020
you know that becomes really difficult

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,490
over an extended period of time and that

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,020
leads to burn out a lot of these are the

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:48,130
problems and growing pains I talked to

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,660
people about this I think that's

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,040
something that Drupal definitely

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,930
experiences that we don't talk about

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,080
enough especially with things like tools

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:01,090
and processes or triple started out at

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,370
being very small community you know you

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,600
might have 10 people in a room who are

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,790
all working on something and it becomes

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,170
very profound and it got contributed to

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,490
Drupal and this was back when it's like

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,320
triple one and two and three and four

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,370
but then you reach a point where you're

00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,630
not dealing with 10 people in a room

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,770
anymore you start dealing with dozens of

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,480
people than hundreds of people have

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,890
thousands of people and right now we

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,450
have thousands of contributors the

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,190
processes and the way things were done

00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,900
and even the culture around how things

00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,420
were done when there are 10 people in a

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,980
room don't work and I see people try to

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,900
force those same standards and those

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,270
same processes on this much larger group

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,010
and it just doesn't work that way and

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,440
you know some people might say things

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,420
like oh you know the way it used to be

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,860
and I just missed that the way it used

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,240
to be and it's like well when you're at

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,470
a point where you've got 5,000 people

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
trying to work on a project it's not

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,880
going to be the way it was you have to

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,350
change you have to adapt to that size

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,140
and our tools have to adapt to that size

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,240
or processes have to adapt to that sides

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,100
and of course that all increases

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,080
expectations like yeah we have were much

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,760
bigger projects we're dealing with

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,650
corporate interests now

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,300
of bigger agencies you have entire

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,520
Drupal agencies whose like their entire

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,620
livelihood is devoted and dependent on

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,090
this project and its success and giant

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,130
corporations that are part of it that

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,170
just raises the expectations for

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,850
everyone involved and that increases the

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,290
pressure or not everyone who's trying to

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,290
contribute them try to be part of this

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,470
so what can we do what are some

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,020
proposals I'd like to hear some ideas

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,600
from people I have some ideas of what I

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,170
think is really important what needs to

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,760
be done where my focus is but I'm really

00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:35,410
interested in what everybody else has to

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,960
say personally I think we need to focus

00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,970
on the human component not on just the

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:45,130
tools and things like the numbers and

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,750
the growth I think that our biggest

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,610
problem especially when it comes to burn

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,040
outs and some of these other issues like

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,260
getting a release done is that we don't

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,900
have enough people that are at that

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,110
higher level of understanding and

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,390
technical skill you know we had so much

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,770
difficulty after beta getting released

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,540
just because we're burning through

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,160
criticals but certain criticals there

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,750
were only like so many people in the

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,970
world who literally knew how to do that

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,800
thing so everyone else is like sitting

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,570
around like hey I love to she reading to

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,830
Drupal it's great it's awesome like oh

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,180
we can't get our religion so let's get

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,290
critical gets done in like well there's

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,400
only two people who know how to do that

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,840
thing so we're all just going to sit

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,520
around and wait till they do it and find

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,200
the time to do it because that's just

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,380
the way it is I think if we can take

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,840
that middle group of people who we know

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,150
are already committed and interested and

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,700
self-motivated to contribute and can

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,670
help mentor them to be that upper

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,860
echelon of skill level and expand that

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,240
top group so it's not these five people

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,190
who know how to handle this critical we

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,320
have 50 people who can do it instead I

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,960
think we're much better off doing that

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,510
then focusing on trying to get another

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,130
thousand people involved when those

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,560
thousand people are only going to commit

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,730
one what issue and then you're never

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,600
going to hear from them to see from them

00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:01,200
again and I think a good way to do this

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,180
is with the local events smaller events

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,920
it's been my experience that the small

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,020
sprints and small events are actually

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,490
much more productive per person I think

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,010
that the large ones and often require

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,300
less effort to actually hold them so

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,910
little Sprint's where we've had like

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,440
five ten fifteen people are always just

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,520
really concentrated in a really

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,530
productive and there are much better

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,460
learning experiences that's showing up

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,950
at an event with like five hundred

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,120
people and half those people are trying

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,770
to mentor half those people like

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,179
anything done everybody's just talking

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,100
with the friends and by the end of the

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,410
day you might actually get more work

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,750
done but per person you don't actually

00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,890
get more work done so if we don't put

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,470
more effort into that maybe more

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,150
sponsorship for those local events more

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,830
support around them in mentorship for

00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,660
them I think that would be great and

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,660
just more things in general that are

00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,520
local I'm really big on local events and

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,160
local resources i think that saw some of

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,390
the human element when it comes to

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,309
language barriers and communications

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,800
problems I think it's you're much better

00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,540
off having mentors that are regional for

00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,220
those people they're much better at

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,540
mentoring them than having random

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,580
strangers that you don't know you've

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,440
never heard of who were in another time

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,520
zone in another part of the world who

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,230
was just trying to tell you what to do

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,970
and there's so much effort that's so

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,170
much overhead an efficiency that goes

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,420
into just trying to manage those

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,520
relationships I think if people can

00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,350
concentrate on keeping that local I

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,630
think it's much more efficient and much

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:25,640
more beneficial to those people you're

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:29,240
gonna say something you're just gonna

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:34,610
see things know things oh oh no I

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,790
am so I'm Liz I'm listening and to so my

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,380
a challenging question that i have is

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:42,260
looking at that number that long tail

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,120
and looking at the efforts we put into

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,750
like mentor and resources and these

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,309
events and stuff like that if we really

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,040
look at it and ask ourselves honest

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:54,770
questions is some of it actually worth

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,380
the effort for them for those people and

00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,650
for the mentoring programs and i'm not

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,770
suggesting stopping I'm just suggesting

00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,020
maybe there's different ways to do it

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,460
I'm a proponent of doing one-on-one

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,559
mentoring I think that would be much

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,870
more beneficial for actually growing

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,610
that middle group of people if we can

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,050
develop a one-on-one mentoring program

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,360
that's more long-term and has greater

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:22,680
commitment from the mentors

00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,990
and my suggestion is maybe we don't stop

00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,460
things like the giant Friday sprints but

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:31,800
maybe we also don't try to kill

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,320
ourselves doing it so I I'd like to do a

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,690
couple of things I'd like to provide

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:44,210
some context both historical and current

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:47,340
I I'd like to propose rhetorical

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,980
possible partial counterpoints to you

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,360
how about we go one by one and no but

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,590
I'm these things are all related and

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,180
also like talk a little bit about the

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,890
things that we're already doing now that

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,300
maybe they were doing on a smaller scale

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,370
now that I maybe aren't reflected in the

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,170
in your experience as a mentor to this

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,460
point or actually to some extent are

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,570
reflected in your experience because we

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,190
were part of Sprint's like the news

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,380
jerseys Frank and so forth over the drip

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,880
it development cycle obvious it said ok

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,800
so like they just Frank framing

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,240
background information here I did I did

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,540
I introduced myself this time I didn't

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:22,470
know I'm xjm I'm a Drupal 8 release

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,120
manager now um and so I kind of

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,030
accidentally started the tour mentoring

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,200
program sort of um the it what Kathy and

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,660
I were chatting about at the beginning

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,430
of the session is like you stated that

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,990
core mentoring was an official thing and

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,180
we're like is it an official thing

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,730
what's official hot an official company

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,620
it's in the maintainer the aspects about

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,220
it our that are officials we did put it

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,420
in maintainer text a year or two ago and

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,220
we do now have drupal association

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,380
support for the mentoring students that

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,700
we run on friday so those two aspects of

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,540
it i guess you kind of could call

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,520
official um but so when when we

00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:00,330
originally started the program the

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,310
intent wasn't we're going to get 500 600

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,250
700 people committed contributing to

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:07,410
core on this friday sprint it was let's

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,350
have a sprint that people can join and

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:12,420
the demand turned out to be much higher

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,700
than we anticipated so every subsequent

00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,040
event it like the first time we were

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,930
like oh maybe we'll get like you know 40

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,960
people at this and then we had you know

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,670
an entire roomful and then the next

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,260
event it was like whoa we need to plan

00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,660
for that entire roomful and it was more

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,000
so it wasn't so much that the intent was

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,960
to have one person mentoring five to ten

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,750
people it was

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,289
that the demand for mentoring at the

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,700
events outpaced what what we were able

00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,799
to deliver and so we had to change what

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,029
we were doing in order to scale it so I

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,309
wouldn't necessarily say that that's

00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:46,710
like a design thing of the of the core

00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:48,539
mentoring initiative no I wouldn't say

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,190
it is I certainly understand the demand

00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,690
is there but you also have to look at

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,490
the results that you get from that so

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,220
answer the question is the question is

00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,830
is like there's two separate goals is

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,360
our goal to help other help people

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,570
contribute to Drupal or is our goal to

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,690
get stuff done and it's less efficient

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,399
for getting stuff done is it a better or

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,940
worse experience for the individual

00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:14,370
contributors is it a dewy like is them

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,549
is the experience that we give people in

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:20,039
the mentoring Sprint's on Friday um like

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:22,169
sufficiently good enough to make for the

00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,809
lack of quality on like a tenth of the

00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:26,520
people right so if we could help we

00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:27,630
could help one tenth of a people really

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,039
really well and they would have a great

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,140
experience and love contributed your

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,880
bowl with the big Friday Sprint's we had

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,409
this hit or miss thing but we provide

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,270
that opportunity to a lot more people so

00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:38,159
it's not even about getting the work

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,990
done interval no it's not about getting

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,710
the work done even specifically on that

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:46,529
day but to that point if seventy percent

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:50,039
of the people involved did only do one

00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:53,490
or two things are you even getting that

00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:56,190
result are you introducing anybody to

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,720
the experience and it's up to any real

00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,820
benefit to them because if they don't

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,059
come back is that a success story or not

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:06,539
so so what on one of the things that was

00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:09,899
always like part of what we just

00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:11,640
accepted because Drupal is a is an open

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:14,850
source project the duoc recei it's an

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,260
opt-in you choose to do thing in in at

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,840
least for the initial experience for a

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,770
lot of people um the philosophy of is

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,730
like this this 110 one rule where you um

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:28,440
you give an opportunity to a hundred

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,870
people to become exposed to something

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,610
become engaged with it and they try it

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:35,680
out and then of those 100 people maybe

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:37,930
only actually 10 come back and

00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,760
and you know participate a second time

00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,070
maybe a third time but then out of those

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,320
100 people there's one person it turns

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:46,210
out is going to be super super amazing

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
that that one time in office hours that

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,620
Cathy phase showed up and holy crap

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,950
right like it turns out to be something

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,380
or source cot cot sir um like years

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,750
later this this little accidental

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,400
opportunity provided someone turns into

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,940
something where where it's not it's not

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,280
when you do fer like it's something that

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,780
you do for everyone on the chance that

00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,140
that one person is going to benefit from

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,490
it and then that in turn like is what

00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,260
provides the future of the project so

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,260
that's like that's the question I'm

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,300
asked is like is it is it a bad is it a

00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:38,410
bad thing or it not as a bad thing but

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:39,730
is it is it is it not not working well

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,280
in see that's the question because it so

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,630
it's so subjective right like like when

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,910
you when you look at the long tail graph

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,740
i was i was a little bit confused by

00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:50,400
your day there because it's like of the

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,570
top a significant number of the top

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,120
contributors to triple-a i thought were

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:58,390
people who are completely new to the

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,800
drupal 8 cycle like a lot of the top top

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,350
people were not heavily involved in

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,730
triple seven core and so I like I'm

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,070
confused by the data are at least in my

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,230
impression of it was that there there

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,420
are a lot of new people my point in that

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,740
was really looking at how many of the

00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,690
people who are eligible seven were

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,920
dropping off not just how many people

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,600
were new there obviously I mean when

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,430
you're more than three times as many

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,350
contributors as you had before obviously

00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,900
there are a lot of new people but no I'm

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,700
saying of like the top people right like

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,140
is it actually a concern that people who

00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,400
were involved in Drupal 7 aren't

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,560
involved in your blatant I don't think

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,240
it necessarily as I don't either that's

00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,430
that's why i think we always have these

00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,010
discussions about people who drop off

00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:41,590
and burn out on things like that and i

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:43,290
don't think it's nessa i don't think

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,460
people leaving is a problem because

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,350
you're talking about five years later

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,870
six years later somebody wants to do

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,210
something else too somebody must do

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,309
tomorrow it shouldn't be seen as a

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,660
negative right I mean if you even if you

00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:56,640
have massive amounts of your community

00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,920
who are disappearing you know for

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,420
specific reasons you know how are

00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,890
they're being treated or you know it's

00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,630
an indication of something really bad

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,030
that's going on but I talked to people

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,700
who say the number one problem in the

00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,710
Drupal community is people disappearing

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:15,330
I don't think it's number one problem at

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,800
all so that I I wanted to the other so

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,290
that the parts two and three there I

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,940
wanted to talk about the things that are

00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,950
currently changing and then I also have

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,360
just as a teaser we're doing a core

00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,890
conversation on Thursday with three so

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,980
that has the other part of the survey

00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,179
results part of which are barriers to

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,980
contribution and I have some data here

00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,120
that's I'm not supposed to share yet but

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,320
I'm going to talk about it anyway at

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,240
least potentially if you guys are

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,440
interested these are all like a number

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,179
of them are things that were up as

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,590
bullet points on yours lines as to

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,360
reason like what are the things that are

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,620
contributions like maybe I'll come back

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,030
to that when we talk about it more since

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,040
I've been talking a whole bunch here um

00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,770
but that so there's two things that are

00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:53,220
going on right now currently that I

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,480
think address some parts of the problems

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,010
that you raised then I just wanna make

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,559
sure that everyone's aware of them one

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:01,920
is that with the with the changes to the

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,410
release cycle this this extremely you

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,880
know having six-month minor releases

00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,460
we're never going to have a year-long

00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,809
beta again where there's complicated

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,880
things you can't understand there's

00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,260
everything is blocked on a handful of

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,660
issues that most people don't know how

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,880
to solve and you it's like why should I

00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,290
participate because I like that we've

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,570
changed the release process so that does

00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:25,380
not ever happen anymore because when we

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:28,350
like instead of we open the development

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,210
branch for the next release as soon as

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,710
the current release goes into beta so

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,970
there's no actual freeze or just work

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,830
just goes to the next branch you can

00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,970
continue progressing you get still get

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,990
feedback are you it's just you're still

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,059
going to commit as soon as your patches

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,210
ready you still get reviewers there's

00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:43,170
just as much value in working on it on

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:45,420
regardless of whether or not you happen

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,640
to be in that beta phase so that's

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,740
something that hopefully is it's

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,030
something that was a consequence of the

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,030
Drupal 8 cycle that is hopefully never

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,860
going to happen again because it was in

00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,540
awful it was awful for contributors it

00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,970
was very difficult for the project and

00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,280
so

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:03,610
so I'm hoping that that kind of thing is

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,440
a mostly solved problem already we will

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,670
have new problems in its place and then

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,600
the other thing that we've started doing

00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:13,900
just recently is um so we've started in

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,760
terms of like assessing you know what in

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,130
terms of like making sure that issues

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,220
have like the next step in place that

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:23,290
actually is what's relevant to the

00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,600
component maintainer issue or the people

00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,160
who know the right thing actually core

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,810
mentoring started out it was supposed to

00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,760
be the beginning just issued reaction

00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,020
that was all that was all initially was

00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,420
and it turned out there were there were

00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,770
a lot more needs people had from it than

00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,410
just like Oh get these issues updating

00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:41,230
but what we started doing now is we're

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,880
doing regular major triage with the

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,350
subsystem maintain errs for just the

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,140
major issues in each of the different

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,820
components so at least the things that

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,470
someone has filed is I think this is a

00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,810
really major bug and it's broken and

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,760
it's growing up my site you don't get a

00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,580
response how often are you doing that

00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,380
triage oh I have here have been we have

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,150
had a triage session almost every two

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,530
weeks since beginning of the year now

00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,930
the scope is obviously enormous because

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:08,700
there are 1,200 major issues so what

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:11,380
we're doing that the other side of that

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,270
advertisement is on friday we're going

00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,040
to try to do as part of the new

00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,770
contributor sprint have an area that is

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,390
specifically about the first part of

00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,730
major triage which is verifying whether

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,990
or not an issue still exists which is a

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,370
great learning opportunity for someone

00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,900
is new contributor because instead of

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,790
having to understand all of these

00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,970
complicated release policies all they

00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:33,940
need to do is learn basics get skills

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,830
about okay can I follow the steps to

00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,010
reproduce this issue if I can prove that

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:41,110
it still exists at a point in the past

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,390
and it doesn't exist now why did that

00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,830
happen so that they it's it's about

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,870
learning to navigate the issue to in at

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,490
the same time filtering out some of the

00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,200
noise in the major issue queue so that

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,450
issues that are relevant to people are

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,830
more easy to find so those are like two

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,410
things that are going on right now what

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:59,500
I think are kind of aligned with with

00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:03,130
fixing the the experience for like the

00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:07,030
the huge both for issues and for

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:12,160
contributors the huge wasteland of there

00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:13,300
being too many things I could talk about

00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,600
the survey results but someone else

00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,600
should ask

00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:36,510
this is chris so he'll pay would totally

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:37,590
um i mean III think that the goal of the

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,059
mentoring program it has to be

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:43,350
completely to support durable you know

00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:44,700
it's in my view it's nice if people have

00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,490
a good time at these things and maybe

00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,679
enhances their visit the triple calm I

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,539
mean they launched the lab Sprint's but

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,370
if they're not if they're not serving

00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:55,519
the purpose of forwarding the project

00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:59,370
and it has a person I think they do so

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:02,580
and if along the same lines if you

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,500
mention the 110 one concept if if the

00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,630
only goal the mentoring program is to

00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,060
find unicorns there might be a more

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,070
effective way of doing that you know

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,980
there might be because it all of us

00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,720
spent a lot of time on this and maybe

00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,220
there's you know there's easier ways of

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,589
finding those people and if we don't

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:23,030
look at that sort of scientifically then

00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:28,440
this is like a cargo cult of mentoring

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:44,970
cargo cult cargo cult of mentoring

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:46,649
google it cargo cult as in yeah it's we

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:51,869
just keep going through emotions hoping

00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:55,440
that they have their effect that it

00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:57,030
might not be so yeah that's and then

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,230
that's I'm just sort of it echoing in

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,109
the second part where just said was that

00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,940
no I mean in the event that we have a

00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:04,530
one of these big sprints and people can

00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,000
be immediately useful towards the

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,190
project well that helps right you know

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,839
if we get a handful people to go through

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,130
a bunch of these issues and triage them

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,170
they just did a bunch of really positive

00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,859
work you know for example it's not that

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,710
hard and you know but I think that

00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:21,420
whatever we do we have to at least

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,360
somehow validate whether these things

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,570
are really

00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:29,290
game for drupal and ah and if they're

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:33,250
not why are we doing that's all yeah but

00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:38,350
they probably are and you know that

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:41,680
because scientific method yeah so

00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:45,010
there's a couple of things and one is I

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,190
think we had when we look at the

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:51,790
resources that are devoted to the

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:55,840
mentoring program the DA puts in some

00:35:51,790 --> 00:36:00,160
money to make fridays at cons happen but

00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,560
they don't put resources into other

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,410
parts of the mentoring program so

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,090
they're done because people get their

00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,520
mentoring sponsored through their work

00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:11,800
or their done because they do it as a

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,650
volunteer and they come from other

00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,920
places and so I don't think we have a

00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:20,080
responsibility to evaluate whether or

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,350
not the mentoring program benefits the

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,000
project I think it doesn't matter

00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,680
whether or not it benefits the project

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,580
as long as it benefits the people

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:35,380
involved so I have to disagree on the

00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:37,600
purpose but agree with the possibility

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,850
that it does both so it may not matter

00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:45,030
that we argue about whether or not we're

00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:45,030
right about the purpose I think

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,019
I think well hey when you met just to

00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:52,970
that point I just want to say one thing

00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:54,349
though is that when I when I think about

00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,980
it would always concerns me and why I

00:36:54,349 --> 00:37:00,950
brought this up is I think we do have an

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,079
obligation though to make sure that if

00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,759
those people are devoting their

00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:09,890
resources their time their energy that

00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:12,470
we are certain that they're not being

00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,269
abused in any way and that if they are

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:17,630
giving too much of themselves which

00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:19,130
people will tend to do very easily we

00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,170
need to be certain that there's even a

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,730
purpose to what they're doing right but

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,930
I agree with that so we need to make

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,420
sure people aren't injuring themselves

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:28,339
or other people but I and that there

00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,079
should be a purpose behind it but I

00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:32,450
think it would be okay if the purpose

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,789
was it doesn't hurt the project but it

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,339
really helps enrich other people's lives

00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:40,970
because I think contributing one time

00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:43,250
does in fact carry a long lasting effect

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,230
on people into their work environments

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:50,720
and and other things that they do that

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:53,900
may not affect the project so I agree we

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:59,180
shouldn't invest a lot of resources and

00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:03,799
something that's hurting people I want

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:08,660
to caution referring to contributors as

00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:10,730
volunteering all the time and because I

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,869
I think we need to look at the

00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:19,460
percentage of the different areas of the

00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:20,960
tail the top contributors the ones who

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,329
have a lot of commit credits are the

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,160
ones that have just one commits credit

00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:28,250
and look at whether or not they were

00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:31,069
paid for their contribution because I if

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,930
we think about different theories about

00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:36,049
how people can get paid some people get

00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:38,420
paid to come to the car and so if they

00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:41,000
spring con Friday they may have actually

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,339
been paid and they may not have been

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,539
volunteering and we get the same thing

00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:49,609
with repeat contributors I think we need

00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:50,060
to be careful about not always assuming

00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:53,140
that the

00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:56,270
are volunteering their time and we are

00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,760
trying to collect data on that but it's

00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:01,460
not publicly available in an easy way

00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,420
and I think the other part of that is

00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:08,270
then we look at how especially for

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:13,490
things that are not just commit credit

00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:16,780
right when we look at why people might

00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:20,200
contribute once and then not again I

00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:23,570
think we need to actually just ask them

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,220
so it would be nice it would be nice to

00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:29,930
know what the results of that survey

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:34,420
question was is that in that that's just

00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:37,820
I thought you just had the the jury's

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:40,520
survey of that's asking people about

00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:44,510
construe that was I did I don't remember

00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,310
questions about contributed maybe he's

00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:53,810
I'm thinking of a different survey hi

00:39:46,310 --> 00:40:07,660
I'm Maureen Johnson here talking so your

00:39:53,810 --> 00:40:10,100
contributor now it is so I was wondering

00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,170
did you sound like you were looking for

00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,620
ideas so this is sort of outside the box

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:18,490
I didn't know like I'm signed up on

00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:21,740
Drupal I didn't know what it is org and

00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:23,780
I was wondering if there is a survey

00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,570
that you could give somebody that could

00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:30,770
that we could fill out to say where we

00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:33,800
might be a best fit and you know whether

00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:35,720
it could say you know like maybe not

00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,670
directly like do you want to do this

00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,800
thing but like that you could ask a

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,620
question that you could gauge what we

00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,440
would be you

00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,450
for so you kind of know and that would

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,340
be like in a pocket for when you need

00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:50,160
people it would be maybe something

00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,900
that's associated with our profile and

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,560
maybe this already exists I don't know

00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:59,460
and right look Neil was any of that in

00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,410
the content re architecture stuff about

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,300
like because I know is that whole idea

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:05,850
of like you could say you're more of a

00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:24,540
UX person and get sort of like tailored

00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:27,210
content to you it's so I was once

00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,430
website personalization yeah cuz I

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,930
thought of like when I was in Middle

00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,250
School they would have us fill out a

00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,080
survey and then they would say oh you

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,640
should be a nurse because you showed

00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,650
these qualities so I don't know if

00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,630
there's a way for you to make it generic

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,780
enough to say they would be really good

00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:45,390
at testing you know like I do I am a

00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,760
contributor in my sight but I know in my

00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,260
business process really well so I'm very

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,970
good at giving them feedback because I

00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,910
can kind of see where it doesn't fit

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:56,460
into the square peg so so is there a way

00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,370
in our profile that we could be poked

00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,260
back to come back and say hey you said

00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:03,900
you were interested and you only

00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,760
contributed once and maybe you'd want us

00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,210
to contribute again and then my last

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,400
point would be I don't know if this is

00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,770
possible but I just registered like last

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,890
week to come to this event so of course

00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:19,200
i paid a late fee which you should but i

00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:22,830
don't know if you can say well we'll

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,810
waive fees if you produce hours or if

00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:27,750
you do that in advance because sometimes

00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:29,970
money motivates people who aren't making

00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:32,010
money from selling software from their

00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,420
business or getting people to come to

00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,250
their company as a government employee

00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,460
but i don't know if it could be

00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:40,670
something where your hours could be you

00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,640
know come back so I just

00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:46,609
as an idea if you can you mean actually

00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,099
paying people no no reducing fees based

00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:53,690
a lot of other the hours that you have

00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:55,760
done yeah grace boss right so if you've

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,059
been doing core contribution this year

00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,650
you can get a free ticket to dribble

00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:02,030
obviously you have your expenses you

00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:08,780
have to cover but I don't know if that

00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:10,790
might be yeah yeah so I'd like to answer

00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,900
like the first question because it's

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:16,569
much safer um if one of so there is

00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,470
something like this that's kind of a

00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:20,569
do-it-yourself version that sort of

00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,099
already exists we have the section of

00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:23,990
the drupal.org handbook called the

00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:27,250
contributor tasks handbook and so what

00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:32,319
it what it has is it has sections like

00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:35,540
based on skills you may have like like I

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:39,079
speak English well or I speak a second

00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:42,020
language or or I i can do documentation

00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:44,510
or like skill sets like that bait not

00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,609
not topical areas but like basic skills

00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:49,280
you have and then underneath that it has

00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:51,410
elkin you can you put could you put it

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,150
up on your screen the contributor to

00:43:51,410 --> 00:44:00,319
send our um I think it's like drupal.org

00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:02,000
/ contributor dash tasks and you can see

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,010
another there's a list of tasks you can

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,470
do each of those tasks has instructions

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,150
and then it has a link to an issue queue

00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,730
that might have issues that have those

00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,799
tasks in it obviously it's really hard

00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:15,140
to like the problem is finding the

00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:16,760
actual issue that has that actual a few

00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,619
can do but at least you can read the

00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,200
instructions of it and say okay based on

00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:22,819
as as someone who's a non-english

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,349
language speaker for example if you

00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:27,140
click on non-english language featured

00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:29,059
speaker you can then see what the tasks

00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,500
are under that group go to that page and

00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:32,270
then this is like oh this is something

00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,059
that I could do to contribute to the

00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:37,369
project the and the reason that we do

00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:40,970
this with like a documented task and

00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:43,460
then a link to a queue is that the the

00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:45,349
process of finding tasks for people to

00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,119
work on is actually one of the most

00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,559
challenging things for the mentoring

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,869
program

00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,579
general has been finding ways because we

00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:53,229
there's you know there's 5,000 issues

00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,569
that are open there's all of these

00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:57,699
different initiatives and so forth so if

00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:59,049
you're involved with like it if you

00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,969
listen to Teresa's keynote and be like

00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:02,380
wow content deployment I think I have

00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:04,089
great ideas about that I'd love to help

00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,849
with that you can get involved with that

00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:08,439
team but if it's more like ah I just

00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:11,079
kind of I don't really know where to

00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:12,910
start I have this skill that I want to

00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:15,519
provide it's much much harder to find

00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:18,849
tasks that are related to that skill so

00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:21,249
instead there's a lot of we try to teach

00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,749
people how we find tasks ourselves so

00:45:21,249 --> 00:45:26,140
this is like a starting point it's

00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:27,969
definitely not nearly as like helpful as

00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,619
a survey it's very do-it-yourself but

00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:31,390
that resource is there and so it's maybe

00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:33,219
a starting point and maybe you've maybe

00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,469
you if you look at this you have ideas

00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:36,880
for us for how to make it into into that

00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:39,249
kind of an interaction if there's a way

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,900
to take this and then do the thing that

00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:44,039
for you would be like oh that would have

00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:48,609
made it so that I know what to do that

00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:54,549
it does not it does not problem there's

00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:56,920
an issue well I mean there's a lot of

00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:59,219
things we would have to give people when

00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,219
they say

00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:11,100
good lately is the the newsletter that

00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:13,500
goes out that reaches a lot of people

00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,840
who just have an account and it kind of

00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,760
post people every once in a while and

00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,400
the quality and information in the

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,290
newsletter I find high like I actually

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:29,250
will read it to figure out what's going

00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:31,410
on and so perhaps we can put in a like a

00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,150
get involved section into the newsletter

00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,520
which just occasionally dribbles out

00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:39,240
like look there's this resource you may

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,340
not have known about and so it allows us

00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,890
to poke people using the tools that we

00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:46,170
have so we don't have to ask the DA to

00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,150
build any new tools so there's always

00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,640
some advantage in that so I think when

00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:53,400
you asked if we have tried poking people

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,440
we haven't but there might be a way we

00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,390
could do something like a newsletter

00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,730
that's already going out to a lot of

00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:10,340
people that might provide some of that

00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:10,340
function err no Mike both of you Mike

00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:18,030
yeah s my ad I think automating all day

00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,310
it's a hard problem computers aren't

00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,010
good at you might show up the sprint and

00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:26,609
not know that really like we be rolling

00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:28,380
patches or that is

00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:34,170
so but yeah there's certainly

00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:36,869
opportunities we could like shorten some

00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:40,829
of the paths that computers aren't going

00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:43,140
to tell us what to do is there any would

00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:45,390
there be any resistance to pushing that

00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,549
information to new users as opposed to

00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,989
them seeking it out so like what we

00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:50,249
discussed before like someone's signing

00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:51,749
up and filling out a survey and saying

00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:53,789
these are my skills and then actually

00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:56,849
have drupal.org pushing that I think we

00:47:53,789 --> 00:48:01,289
have an issue for that as a proposal to

00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:03,509
to like as to adapt the new user signup

00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:05,249
process on drupal.org so that it gives

00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:07,739
them more information about the next

00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:09,180
steps and then a related outstanding

00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:11,970
task that hasn't been cared for in the

00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,529
same way for a long time is improving

00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,910
the contribute section of a handbook so

00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:15,900
that it's actually something we can

00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:25,140
point them at that it's going to be

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:26,960
useful to that so like in well I think

00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:30,210
also part of the problems being able to

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,460
better organize the work that we have

00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,440
like when someone shows up and says I'm

00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,329
aux expert I can help on that stuff like

00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,710
give me something to work on we do the

00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:39,180
answer for that now which is that the

00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,160
usability team has started their own

00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,230
website that that scrapes issue data

00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,950
from drupal.org using govers rocket ship

00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:50,249
thing so that like if if your skill is

00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:52,079
usability we've had a very difficult

00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:55,470
time for the duration of the Drupal 8

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,569
cycle connecting usability experts

00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:00,269
designers and project managers

00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:02,359
especially with the areas that that

00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:04,380
they're good at to some extent like

00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,970
front-end developers we were able to

00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,369
connect to issues and we did a really

00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,499
great job with people with documentation

00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:11,910
skill and back-end developers and a

00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:14,789
great job with people who are just

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:16,680
willing to test anything and so there's

00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:18,299
like depending on what the skill is like

00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,279
you'd ever have a better or worse

00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:23,789
experience at these these Sprint's that

00:49:20,279 --> 00:49:25,109
we've been talking about okay so so i'm

00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:26,819
going to talk like i'm going to talk

00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:29,099
just briefly about some of the survey

00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:30,720
results that came up in conversation but

00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,849
if you're interested in this come to

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,580
teresa's core conversation on thursday

00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:35,980
afternoon

00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:37,720
last one before the closing session and

00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:40,900
hopefully we'll actually managed to get

00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,880
some of this data segmented and in into

00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,800
the slides because we haven't done that

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,990
yet because we're all very busy people

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,260
and busy doing other things like giving

00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:52,180
the jury's note for example that's

00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,000
dreese and then others of us helping

00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,530
with content in it on so that this in

00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,230
the survey results one of the questions

00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:04,000
that was asked was about if so so what

00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:07,830
is your involvement with with Drupal

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,830
I'll let's see the exact wording was

00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,850
sorry I had wake in front of me and I

00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,000
scroll the way from it for some stupid

00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,000
reason

00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,990
ok so what which of the following best

00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:26,050
describe how you relate to Drupal is the

00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:29,230
exact question there were about 3,000

00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:30,990
people who answer the survey and big big

00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:33,670
disclaimer that there is extreme

00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:35,530
participation by us here because people

00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,810
who take the survey are people who are

00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,730
already interest in durable and to a

00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,990
disproportionate extent people who

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,930
probably had a good experience with

00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:46,090
fearful and even more disproportionately

00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,160
people who've been paid to contribute or

00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:51,930
who are already like have a successful

00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,570
like volunteer career if you will quote

00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:57,280
yes so but so in those in those survey

00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:59,800
results of the respondents of three

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,120
thousand people twenty-four percent say

00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,280
they contributed to Drupal in a

00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,530
volunteer capacity and then among those

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,930
twenty-four percent six percent of the

00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:10,060
total um so and actually a hundred and

00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,680
sixty four people I think as of like a

00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,810
week ago so that they're actually paid

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,880
to contribute to Drupal so which is a

00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:17,620
bigger number than I was expecting now

00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,450
that's not necessarily paid full-time

00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,130
that can be came in a part-time capacity

00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:23,950
through like twenty percent time it's

00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,360
not specific on the survey but we do we

00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,400
do actually have you know some

00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,860
information that an increasing

00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,140
percentage of people are contributing as

00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,660
pay contributors um but it's still it's

00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,400
still also a minority of the groups by a

00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:38,410
significant fraction at least from the

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,730
people who cared enough about people to

00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:43,960
spend 15 minutes filling out this

00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:45,580
difficult survey um and then going on

00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,850
there's also a question on here about

00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:50,680
there were two questions about um what

00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,750
it what are your biggest frustrations

00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,310
with Drupal itself and then another one

00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,280
was what are your biggest frustrations

00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:59,230
with contributing to jerkle and the one

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,580
about that obviously the frustrations is

00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,260
through people it's a far for some

00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,260
people a stopping point but what I

00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,840
thought was interesting is of only

00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:09,910
twenty four percent of people said they

00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,110
contributed to Drupal but almost all of

00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,730
them answered the question about

00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:14,800
frustrations with Drupal or like

00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,410
something something like four fifths

00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,670
answered

00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,059
tune about what their frustrations are

00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,140
so this what we can sort of infer that

00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:23,390
there are a lot of people who tried

00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,200
contributing once and went away because

00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:29,500
they had a frustration with it um and

00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,569
what I'd like to look more like that the

00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:34,609
like who answered which things but what

00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:36,710
we can tell right now is that the top

00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,299
response was thirty-four percent of

00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,430
people were frustrated with the complex

00:52:38,299 --> 00:52:43,220
issue queue process which supports what

00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,690
you were saying earlier about like they

00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,069
march Athene's work and I don't know

00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:48,829
what I'm supposed to do next and the

00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:50,180
issue doesn't tell me right like I I

00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:51,650
have no idea where to go from here

00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,150
there's all these requirements the

00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,500
requirements around the beta phase are

00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,089
another example the way there was all of

00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,099
this issue queue process that was a

00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,780
necessary evil but resulted in

00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:02,660
especially for newer contributors about

00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,390
experience on the second highest result

00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:07,789
was that bugs and patches don't get

00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,799
reviewed and fixed fast enough that was

00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:11,930
thirty two percent of respondents were

00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:14,150
concerned about the the rate of feedback

00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:18,049
and the issues and then the third

00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:19,849
highest response was that the the size

00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:22,099
of the drupal code base itself was too

00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:24,410
overwhelming and too complex to figure

00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:27,020
to figure out how to get involved there

00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:29,750
are issues on there about language or

00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:31,640
cultural barriers which was a very like

00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:33,020
one of the lowest percentages it was

00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,569
actually the lowest percentage response

00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,700
but then there's the the participation

00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:39,319
biased thing there is if you've had

00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,940
language or cultural barriers to

00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:42,770
participating that's probably also a

00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,079
reason that you the survey wasn't

00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:47,630
promoted to you right it was in English

00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,130
first of all and and so all of those

00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,869
language and cultural barriers that kept

00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:52,430
you from getting involved with Drupal

00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:53,930
are also various for all the things

00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,869
there but that that's so that's the day

00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:58,579
that we have so far it's it's I think

00:53:56,869 --> 00:54:00,589
that the safest thing to do is to start

00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:02,480
with the things that we know are known

00:54:00,589 --> 00:54:04,160
problems for people who at least tried

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,569
wants to contribute because it's much

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,920
more difficult to find the people that

00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:08,740
we haven't been able to reach it all yet

00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,290
and that's like an entirely supper

00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,150
so was the the whole patch workflow

00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:16,860
stuff was that one of the answers or is

00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:19,980
that roped into issue queue workflow a

00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,560
complex issue that the full text is

00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,430
complex issue queue process and slow

00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,320
consensus-building was one possible

00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:28,450
response that had the highest number of

00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,890
respondents and the second was bugs and

00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:33,550
patches don't get reviewed and fixed

00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:37,060
fast enough so that that deliver that

00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:40,000
doesn't like tools and technology it

00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:42,850
doesn't distinguish between the the the

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,110
tools and the procedure because for for

00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,550
a new contributor those are actually

00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,770
kind of part of the same thing right

00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:50,200
there's this whole set of unknown things

00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,760
that you have to learn that are some of

00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,100
them are procedural and some of them are

00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,660
related to the tool itself but the fact

00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,250
the matter is that procedure and tool

00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,070
are like two sides of the same thing

00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:01,960
like our tools should explain what the

00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:04,450
procedure is that the tool should be

00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,490
what the procedure is and and our

00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,590
procedures on the other hand need to be

00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:10,300
surfaced on our tools and not documented

00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:12,460
off somewhere else remotely so that's

00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:14,350
like an a part of an internal part of

00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,960
the problem we did do a separate

00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:18,310
contribution barrier assessment which is

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,230
an exercise with a small group of piece

00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:21,970
of people recently that I can also on

00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,680
which we shared internally which is we

00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,300
went through and evaluated like a

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,410
hundred different barriers to

00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:31,090
contribution and said ah just is this

00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:33,850
for from people who are dedicated

00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:37,510
herbalists is this up first of all is

00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:39,190
it's a problem that will take is is that

00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:41,470
a horrible problem is a slight problem

00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:42,820
will it will it improve the experience a

00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:45,310
little bit or a lot and then compared

00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:47,770
that with would this take a week to fix

00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:49,810
a month to fix a year to fix I don't

00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:51,640
think we can ever fix it and and using

00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:54,640
those two things we came up with a short

00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:56,560
list of a couple of both tool and

00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,830
process improvements that we can

00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:01,690
implement in the short term to try to

00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:04,359
get the most benefit with the least

00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:06,420
amount of despair and frustration on so

00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:06,420
I

00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:12,210
but well the difference is that they're

00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:14,280
being implemented right now so the the

00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:15,660
the top the the thing that we identified

00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,360
is the top priority from process

00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,590
perspective both is usability problem

00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,980
we're talking about it's too difficult

00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:24,180
to make usability and design

00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,500
contributions too difficult to improve

00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,110
the user interface in a correct way

00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,000
through the core issue view and so the

00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:32,910
solution that we're testing for that is

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,420
this new usability team with its own

00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:38,670
separate site and new set of processes

00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,110
that hopefully our reflect more what

00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:42,150
designers needs our versus what a

00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:45,420
back-end developers framework managers

00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:47,460
needs are and then the one of the sort

00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,610
of like we identified several top

00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:52,200
priorities in terms of the tools things

00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,400
that have required to mr. Drupal at ark

00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,420
itself and then we actually shared that

00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,730
short list with the drupal association

00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,140
and said okay of these things we think

00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,500
these things could be doable in a short

00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,760
time which of these are hard or easy and

00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,890
like we were actually wrong about what

00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,140
for example like one of the things that

00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,970
came up as something that could be

00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,020
implemented in a short time scale it

00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,810
would be really effective is just

00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:14,670
automatically checking if patches apply

00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:16,020
or not when their needs review and

00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,430
marking the needs work if they don't

00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,260
apply without a full test run

00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,760
automatically so you don't have to come

00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,710
back after four weeks and find out the

00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,240
patch doesn't apply anymore and then as

00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:27,570
a second follow-up step that is that you

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,920
can then automatically roll patches

00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,330
that's no longer a requirement because

00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,310
that's something that you know

00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:35,310
two-thirds of the time a computer can't

00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:36,840
actually do um so there's so there's

00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:39,630
issues open for both of those things and

00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,600
so we are actually and maybe maybe we

00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:44,420
just need to commute communication

00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:48,570
problem education might be helpful yes

00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:50,310
um that that mean it was actually before

00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,780
the survey launched that we that we

00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:55,410
started doing these two things so that

00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:56,910
that's where the like address the tools

00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:59,100
part of it and the process part of it in

00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,420
parallel because fixing those two things

00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,670
has different requirements fixing

00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,830
process just requires us to come up with

00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:06,150
a better process that still meets the

00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:08,190
needs that the original process was

00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,860
created for but fixing the tools

00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,420
requires a lot of times diet design

00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,220
resour

00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,960
is developing resources and so on so

00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,369
that that's kind of like well let's

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,170
let's tackle both of those things at

00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:19,910
once that they can I can you sum that up

00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,859
before we go any further we're pretty

00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:23,210
much I did wasn't that done okay well

00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:31,579
you might have tires oh no I were still

00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:33,799
talking okay all right I want to hear

00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:36,260
them this is Peter linen I just think

00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:39,190
all things in terms of feedback more

00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:42,710
directly to David's lot about one-on-one

00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:44,119
mentoring something I haven't seen

00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:46,430
happen I don't know could happen is

00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:48,230
collecting contact information from

00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,640
people at especially larger sprint so

00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:52,160
maybe also has partnered with about or

00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:54,650
signup process and the auto what part of

00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,540
that is in big they're collecting you

00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:59,180
know where do you did and are you you

00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,770
know can we share your contact

00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,809
information with people organizing

00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,099
events in your area because I think that

00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:06,049
making that connection between people

00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:08,240
who have traveled to attend authority

00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:11,480
might not get reconnected with a more

00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,579
local group is seems to me like that

00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,880
could be a gap in kind of keeping this

00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:19,099
people engaged a longer term and then

00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,869
another suggestion you should have

00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:25,089
mentioned funding the money somewhere in

00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:27,920
there but i think i have never seen a

00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:30,349
push and i don't know who come from

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,240
exactly but it feels like like to be

00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:35,150
useful to start having a conversation

00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,400
about if your company uses rupal like

00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,140
maybe there's a sort of range of

00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,010
percentages of your revenue from Drupal

00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,020
that you should be contributing back and

00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,880
you know can we

00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:48,070
better kind of stepping up and saying

00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,520
yes I am contribute this much back to

00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:53,560
support the association or sprints were

00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:56,380
fun people or or like have a range of

00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:58,570
ways that it you contribute back money

00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,900
but that you know it is free software

00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:04,840
but you know you need get money really

01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:08,490
to make these things keep going for

01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:11,490
social our community it's out there

01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,490
anymore

01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:35,849
drum said yes we can but we don't want

01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:37,290
it to be a multi-page thing and so we

01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:46,440
have to decide what's most important he

01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:48,030
said yes we can but josh said no you had

01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,339
a you had a point thought you wanted to

01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:53,540
ask a question the gentleman a bit just

01:00:50,339 --> 01:01:13,319
kept talking I was trying to interact

01:00:53,540 --> 01:01:19,609
