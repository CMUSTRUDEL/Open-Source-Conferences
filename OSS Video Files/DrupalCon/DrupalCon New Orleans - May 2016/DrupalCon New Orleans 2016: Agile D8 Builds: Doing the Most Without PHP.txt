Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Agile D8 Builds: Doing the Most Without PHP
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	One of the design philosophies behind Drupal 8 is the ability to make simple things easy and complex things possible. While there is a lot of neat stuff “under the hood” with Drupal 8, this talk will discuss how you can leverage the Drupal 8 core stack to build pretty awesome websites without writing (or including) a line of custom or contributed PHP.

Gone are the days of needing to install several modules just to properly model your data. Gone are the days of needing to do a lot of wrangling just to get a WYSWIYG. Gone are the days of needing to install a module just to make a list of content. Gone are the days of needing custom code to export your configuration to even more custom code.



Come join Matt Cheney and David Strauss from Pantheon to see some live site building on stage and learn techniques to quickly and agiling build sites for prototypes or production.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
is a talk agile Drupal 8 builds doing

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,980
the most without PHP this was a talk

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,170
that David and I sort of had been

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,809
chatting a lot about Drupal 8 being

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,519
released and sort of both working at

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,310
Pantheon and seeing a lot of our

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,800
customers and partners make and start to

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,720
develop Drupal 8 sites sort of try to

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,720
think about what kind of development

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,130
practices and development patterns are

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,769
going to make the most sense for this

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,199
new CMS that we've both been doing

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,210
Drupal a very long time and we've seen a

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,460
lot of different kinds of ways to make

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,770
sites and I would sort of put forward

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,110
today that building a Drupal 8 site is

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,590
going to be a different kind of process

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,620
for developers and site builders then

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,600
doing in previous versions of Drupal so

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,070
this is a talk it's you know not the

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,690
most advanced talk I think either of us

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,699
have given but I think it has a lot of

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,800
interesting components and it's very

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,079
much a sort of action oriented example

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,690
rated attempt to sort of put out there a

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,489
sort of philosophy that we feel is

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,470
appropriate for building Drupal 8 sites

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,330
and to sort of talk about some of the

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,390
challenges that we face sort of doing

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,670
some of their own construction with that

00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,590
so in terms of introductions my name is

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,600
Matt Cheney I work on the magical

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,460
platform this pantheon been doing that

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,020
for about five years which means I have

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,420
a lot of experience obviously on the

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,280
server side but also actually working

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,960
with a lot of people here in this room

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,970
and at this conference who use us to

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,290
actually build the websites of their

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,560
dreams and the dreams of their friends

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,479
families and followers I also very much

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,880
believe in the power of site building in

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,530
the power of people who aren't extremely

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,659
technical who aren't going to write a

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,700
lot of code to leverage open source

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,229
technologies that I think that we've

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,119
been building something very great in

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,740
the Drupal community over the last 10

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,689
years but I think it needs to be

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,090
increasing and accessible to other

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,399
people who aren't technical as you know

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,770
sort of coders that we have the power to

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,259
build GUI interfaces to do a lot of

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,840
things that previously you would have to

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,119
write code so to that end I absolutely

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,939
love the worker miles had done both with

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,829
views and with panels huge advocate of

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,410
panels as a sort of solution for site

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,360
building and spend a lot of time with

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,870
David's know Peck and others building a

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,610
technology solution

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,159
panoply that we'll talk about today

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,620
which is basically an attempt to bundle

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,299
a lot of functionality together provided

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,940
out of the box really great

00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:26,860
drag-and-drop building experience for

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,170
sites and it's the kind of thing that I

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,390
had seen a lot of folks find success and

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,340
actually doing and you know i think the

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,140
Drupal 8 will even empower stuff bigger

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,299
and I'm excited to be here today to

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,799
share sort of my understanding of

00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:40,269
working with Drupal 8 sites and to take

00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:45,510
some questions and start that

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:47,560
conversation and I'm David Strauss I

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,019
worked on the design of Drupal aids

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,150
configuration management system and my

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:55,120
real goal with all the stuff is to

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,090
harmonize the easy and tough use cases

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,430
Drupal where historically we've had

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,200
thing situations where you would either

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,540
do a completely different method for

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,459
doing the really complex advanced way

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,680
and you would have some sort of basic

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,230
way that serious site designers look

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,879
down on and I think that we can really

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,890
harmonize those approaches in ways where

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,930
you can build professional sites and you

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,760
can configure them through the GUI and

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,160
you can deliver things faster to

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,959
customers faster uses of Drupal this is

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,819
how we stay competitive against projects

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,859
like WordPress it's also how we stay

00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:30,849
competitive against everything from up

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:32,889
the stack for SAS products like Weebly

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,079
etc that allow you to configure Lee to a

00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:37,720
site and down the stack against

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:44,139
frameworks that are based entirely on

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:46,090
you pulling up a shell and coding so

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:48,549
that this is a talk sort of about

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,459
getting back to basics with respect to

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:54,609
building websites that Drupal is at its

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,940
core a CMS it's designed to manage and

00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,859
display content and it does that

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,449
increasingly well that you can use

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,120
Drupal for other things than just

00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:06,669
content management folks do often with

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,199
great success but i think that the kinds

00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,389
of problems that i'm interested in

00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,370
solving and interested in helping other

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:15,160
people solve our sort of information

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,500
problems that before i was in drupal

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,479
doing technology work i was librarian

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,130
and a lot of those kind of problems i

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,820
think are very analogous to problems in

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,040
tack

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,450
we're better as people if we know more

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,030
things if we can access more information

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,700
if we can share and I think that sort of

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,070
open source tools like drupal help us to

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,200
accomplish that and after sort of 10

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,790
plus years a very serious Drupal

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,130
development we have some really great

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,020
tools to use that there's a lot of

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,570
genius has been put into this framework

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,670
and a lot of people and use cases have

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,920
been solved in meaningful ways that we

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,200
can all benefit from today to accomplish

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,360
our work and I think that's the job of

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,010
many of us in the room that we're

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,200
building sites for people who have to

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,090
share information we're helping to them

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,730
to manage their content and let other

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,470
people know about it and that we want to

00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,120
find the best approaches for it which is

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,750
probably one of the reasons that you're

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,340
in this talk today but one of the crazy

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,590
things about Drupal is that you can do

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,290
all these other crazy stuff with it like

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,420
it's not just about you know simple

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,130
content creation that you have all of

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,650
these tools expressing tools at your

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,510
disposal and you can make wild sites

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,280
with Drupal and I've done a bunch of

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,620
crazy stuff with Drupal I've done you

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,420
know Drupal 5 Arabic sites on USB keys

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,760
they get shipped off to do you know sort

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,530
of weird stuff make crazy internets for

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,870
a bunch of people to you know share

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,460
files even made a website for doughnuts

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,650
for my friends just to like make you

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,180
know crazy maps happen and I think in

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,000
each of those cases you had these really

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,770
complicated use cases that you know you

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,870
sort of had to choose in many cases very

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,630
weird pathways to actually accomplish

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,530
you know sort of common tasks and I

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,360
think that's one of the really crazy

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,490
about Drupal is it because you could do

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,380
everything which is awesome it can

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,690
sometimes take away from sort of the

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,490
base functionality because well in this

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,260
room we're all building different kinds

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,030
of sites for different kinds of people

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,230
many of the structures and

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,750
functionalities those sites are actually

00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,760
very very similar you know we're have a

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,460
blog system we have a commenting system

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,860
like we have some sort of image gallery

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,110
like these are common use cases that as

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,460
Drupal you can get and build them but

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,560
you can build them in a lot of different

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,930
ways and I think that is actually and

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,880
can be very confusing for people not

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,340
only as I start out to build these kinds

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,680
of systems but as they actually maintain

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,630
and support them over the long run which

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,400
is a problem sort of in terms of web web

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,150
hosting and web platform where we see a

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,720
lot

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:40,210
so it's 2016 I want to build like a

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,830
basic website with content some of this

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,920
stuff should be easy should be really

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,990
straightforward but in many cases I

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,370
think it's it's not that if you look at

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,050
some of the websites and we've seen a

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,970
lot of these things rupal six Drupal 7

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,980
sites we're talking sites that have

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,870
hundreds of contributed modules from

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,210
dozens of different developers that have

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,340
a lot of different crazy releases and

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,810
that people sort of start off projects

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,480
really just like throwing code at the

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,560
problem and I think that that

00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,600
contributes to a lot of sort of a few no

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,140
cruft and and difficulty and maintenance

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,540
going forward so and apologies to Emma

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,330
Goldman for putting her on this slide at

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,700
a business conference but I wanted to

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,260
throw out a radical idea here that when

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,970
we're talking about development and

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,160
we're talking about starting a Drupal 8

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,560
site to actually build a website for

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,960
someone that I think that I'd like to

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,570
propose that you start with and maybe

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,200
even end with just using the Drupal 8

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,750
core module set that you'll still end up

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,510
writing some code you'll use your twig

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,820
templates to do some HTML CSS and

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,580
JavaScript some cases to do actually

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,790
very complicated and custom things and

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,520
you do may end up using a contributor or

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,710
two as part of your work but I think

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,540
that there is a real value in trying to

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,510
keep the development work that you do as

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,750
close to a sort of Drupal core solution

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,550
as possible I don't actually think this

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,740
was true and all sort of explained that

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,230
in previous versions of Drupal but I do

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,060
think that drew in Drupal 8 it's true

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,060
because when we talk about writing

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,760
custom code writing custom PHP I just

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,500
put to you mean isn't the 237,000 lines

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,100
of PHP and drew blade enough for your

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,390
project to need more code do you want to

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,060
support Marco do you want to maintain

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,100
were code I mean in some cases yes of

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,810
course you do but I think that for the

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,180
first time and you know the history of

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,190
Drupal I feel we have what is actually a

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,010
complete content management system that

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,650
we can actually do rollout Drupal 8 and

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,510
make a real website that looks and feels

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,020
and does the kinds of stuff the users

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,150
expect in 2016 it also has the advantage

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,540
in the case of Drupal a core that it's

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,339
the code base the prod

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,110
ject that's actually that has the

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,149
highest quality code in the entire

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,630
ecosystem better than any controller

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,920
most new contribs and it has the

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,230
smartest and some of the most dedicated

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,269
people working on it and I don't want to

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,220
I crib is wonderful and it's an amazing

00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,500
part of Drupal ecosystem but there is

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,269
this sort of magic that happens with

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,759
Drupal core that it is this unified

00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:12,560
development process that it has a set of

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,660
very explicit standards for how things

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,670
are developed and you have this very

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,740
like regular release cycle but like on

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,540
any given Wednesday you could get a new

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,089
version of Drupal and it can get better

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,339
stuff along with that security bug fixes

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,380
features like that and with solutions

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,480
like Pantheon or drush or other places

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,120
you just click one button to update your

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,430
core you get all of that value as part

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,290
of just a regular process and I think

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,360
that that's actually something that as

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,709
developers in terms of building we can

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,630
gain a lot of advantage starting from

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,519
that point but as we maintain these

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,470
sites over the long run we can have a

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,190
lot of sustainability with that kind of

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,750
solution because this is true in Drupal

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,300
8 but it was not something that was true

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,519
in Drupal 7 or before here's some usage

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,740
statistics just between Drupal core

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,899
itself and views as a contributed

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,540
project and if you look at this sort of

00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,670
eighty percent of all Drupal 7 web sites

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,160
had to it you know install the views

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,600
module in order to actually do any of

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,579
the things that they wanted to or to do

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,860
things that they wanted to do on their

00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:14,269
site that you know and I'd also question

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,649
of it you know twenty percent that

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,329
weren't using vuze sort of what exactly

00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,480
those sites sites we're doing I mean

00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:22,040
maybe awesome stuff for sure but the you

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,019
know the idea that you needed to have

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,490
can trip you hadn't had contributes and

00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:30,980
this you know creates a lot of problems

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,899
honestly in the in terms of development

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,209
and maintenance you know there's some

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,769
clear discoverability issues when we're

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,480
talking about getting new people in the

00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,040
ecosystem to say hey you should use

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,050
Drupal so they go out and download

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,519
Drupal may try to do it and they don't

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,529
have views so they don't know what

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,660
really to do and they'll eventually find

00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,250
it many do but many also give up and

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,480
that's frustrating obviously because we

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,850
put a lot of time energy and making

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,769
Drupal great the same thing is also true

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,050
terms of actually maintaining your site

00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,480
if you have you know one two three or

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,990
four contribs suddenly your development

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,940
practice is now

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,060
only around kors release cycle and coors

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,220
practices but also this contribs as well

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,020
and you put some crazy legos together to

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,940
try to make sites you try to make

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,010
something really cool but you know up

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,720
until Drupal 8 it was really hard to get

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,690
something that was really awesome

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,630
awesome out of the box and I think sort

00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,279
of as software consumers people who are

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,800
you know using website technologies

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,230
building stuff we want something really

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,089
awesome out of the box we want a really

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,160
good first-time user experience for

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,680
developers for site builders for you

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,330
know end users for everybody that the

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,130
Internet's grown a lot and I think one

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,050
of the challenges the Drupal faces is

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,149
that it is a very customized kind of

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,550
tool set and it's increasingly competing

00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:46,589
against a sort of web solutions that

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,200
allow you to log in and have really

00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:51,480
fantastic user experiences to build you

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,029
know Facebook profiles or Yelp pages or

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,980
you know these kinds of other kinds of

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,600
things and then when you looked at

00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,700
something like Drupal 6 rupal 7 that

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,070
sort of first-time user experience was

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,779
very lacking that you didn't have these

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,420
like core components as part of the

00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,610
solution you had to find other stuff and

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,100
that even with inside of the core

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,899
product like in Drupal 6 & 7 you had

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,970
these what seemed to be obvious pathways

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,579
like I want polls so I have a pole

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,440
module or I want blogs by the blog

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,779
module or I want a forum sort of a forum

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,670
module that were ultimately inadequate

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,529
solutions for many cases for those

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,850
projects that you know you wanted

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:28,290
something like flag module that you

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,730
could do a lot more stuff with their

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,220
blog you wanted to build up your own

00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,620
content type and list it with fuse these

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,730
are things that you know may people who

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,950
are first-time developer is very

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,959
frustrated and I think part of growing

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,270
the community in the ecosystem is having

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,790
solutions that actually get to a point

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,260
where I can start with it I can be

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,550
successful with it and I can deploy a

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,730
site because I think that's sort of what

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,430
we all want so this is something that I

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,399
tried to do with some other folks in

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:59,370
Drupal 7 doing a sort of distribution of

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,470
Drupal called panoply which I would

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,779
quite love it started out as a project

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,000
with University of California Berkeley

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,339
to build a sort of distribution of

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,079
Drupal for university sites but it

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,880
quickly came you know to be that like

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,120
while there was some cool University

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,890
functionality we had in

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,950
a lot of the sort of generalized

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,170
starting point technology was actually

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,180
applicable well beyond that that you

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,920
know the idea with kenapa leah was that

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,839
we could provide a sort of single

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,730
foundation a single out-of-the-box

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,730
product that you could download and

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,770
install and it was Drupal it had a lot

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,630
of cool stuff in it but it was one thing

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,220
and when you it came out at a new

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,020
version you could update it and get all

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,640
of those updates and it was a good

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,190
foundation for site building it had a

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,960
lot of really awesome tools and it sort

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,820
of looked like this you know we had

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,400
Drupal 7 as the core sort of course

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,920
stack we had some modules on top and

00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,150
then we actually sort of created these

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,520
different like pieces of functionality

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,960
you know like responsive layouts and

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,570
media integration and administrative

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,760
dashboard WYSIWYG and stuff like this

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,080
and the important thing was that like

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,000
none of these solutions i would say

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,529
we're like a plus kind of things but

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,180
they were all pretty good and they're

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,130
all extendable in ways that actually

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,440
help developers but i let them start

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,210
much higher up the stack and i think

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
that's one lesson sort of from working

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,510
in technology for last decade is that

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,400
when we're doing development it's

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,870
important to try to like you know stand

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,880
on the shoulders of other people who

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,410
have done stuff before they don't need

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,150
to reinvent the wheel that you're doing

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,279
your best work when you're leveraging

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,510
other people's talents and i think

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,190
that's sort of part of what i think is

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,800
awesome in Drupal 8 and part of what

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,120
panoply is trying to do in Drupal 7

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,950
because things like selecting even

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,110
modules to start with on a site could be

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,510
very frustrating that like you know in

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,820
many cases you would need to have dozens

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,080
of modules on a stupid 6 site to build a

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,700
lot of the kind of functionality you

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,110
wanted and that because different

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,910
modules you know had you know

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,920
competitive kind of solutions and that

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,959
integrating them together was a little

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,250
bit of a challenge it was hard so part

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,839
of what we did and propylene was to

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,400
actually pick the modules that we

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,860
thought were really good and actually

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,270
sort of put them together and that was

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,310
important because there are things that

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,930
you would do in Drupal like you would

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,640
like want to like make like a link or

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,260
something or you want to make a date

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,610
field but you didn't know about link

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,589
module and you didn't know about date

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,570
module so you just make a text field and

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,580
might just like slap in the information

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,230
into that field but it wouldn't validate

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,450
it wouldn't display right and it would

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,650
be very frustrating you know and that in

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,329
terms of adding these things it wasn't

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,520
just about putting these modules and

00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,250
turning them on it was about harmonizing

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,350
them with the

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,150
mission systems and the roles we had is

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,100
about tracking key patches across the

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,830
modules for review it was making sure

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,330
everything worked well together it was

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,070
also important for Papa we want to build

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,780
these like site building features things

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,550
that i think in drupal 8 you know we're

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,590
going to have very nice analogies to

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,120
sort of going forward that this is the

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,800
panel's ipe let you do some drag and

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,410
drop stuff and then Rosie know a lot of

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,900
other functionality that we did sort of

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,370
using blocks with Drupal 8 we have a

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,960
much better block system we have a lot

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,420
of these kind of functionalities already

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,010
bellick baked in we also made it in top

00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,510
lane administration system that looks a

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,540
lot like some of the Drupal 8 stuff as

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,100
well as well as the WYSIWYG system sort

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,050
of that you know came out of the box

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,330
because as a content management system

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,430
solving core content management problems

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,740
having a WYSIWYG is like a necessary

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,240
component of that solution and it wasn't

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,550
until Drupal 8 that we actually had that

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,280
solution and that I think in my view was

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,570
a really big gap so I don't wanna go too

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,640
far down there's a lot of features that

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,200
we had like built out as part of this

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,080
thing's like responsive layouts that

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,180
Drupal 8 does as well that are important

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,830
to what we're sort of trying to do but

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,570
this is the kind of stuff that I think

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,310
that you know I thought about a lot in

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,350
the Drupal 8 cycle and spent a lot of

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,360
time trying to build because having that

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,010
sort of palabok solution was really

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,810
important and it got a lot of pick up

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,460
people were excited about using it it

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,350
wasn't like you know everyone using it

00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,360
like views but we had a lot of people

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,480
who saw panoply as a good starting place

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,160
because it had that foundation and I put

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,200
to you that like that was really awesome

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,540
and it was good work and there was a lot

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,640
of nice patterns that came out of it but

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,560
making that all happen was really

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,089
difficult and i think that like when you

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,740
sort of talk about developing a site

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,630
where you're molding a lot of modules

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,699
together getting all of that to work

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,650
together can be really hard this is the

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,480
info file from our like WYSIWYG

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,040
integration where we're talking about

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,199
like 15 or something different

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,209
dependency modules that all need to be

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,640
put together to do things like handling

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,680
image resizing and media integration and

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,260
security and all this other stuff and

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,730
that you know that was a lot of work and

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,079
something that I think you know a lot of

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,000
developers struggle to do they're

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,830
reinventing the wheel and not leveraging

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,380
other stuff by trying to like figure out

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,260
this recipe and I think that that's um

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,880
you know not so great so what I would

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,310
say is sort of you know wrap back kind

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,870
this kind of

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,010
you know I think there were some lessons

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,140
I learned for trying to build an

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,790
out-of-the-box solution in Drupal 7 that

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,470
I think are very relevant to why Drupal

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,200
8 is the right solution to start with

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,210
has a sort of core product the first is

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,030
that you know having a big development

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,980
core team is really important that a

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,140
panoply we had about half a dozen people

00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,340
who would help which was awesome but you

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,140
know this limited the ability of

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,370
velocity of features and you know

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,490
integrations just because you don't have

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,530
as many folks we also had some really

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,260
serious challenges dealing with actually

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,760
putting configuration into code and you

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,650
know getting something like that working

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,180
that it wasn't just about you know

00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,310
making sure we had a feature that

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,590
bundled the config but allowing it to be

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,500
easily overextended and modified as it

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,480
sort of went on we also have really

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,100
interesting challenges dealing with code

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,650
quality and structure varying across

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:33,420
projects that not all controls and they

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,480
could change based on the release which

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,470
could of course come out at any time

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,390
they're also as a real sort of

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,230
difficulty in centralizing this work I

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,790
think this is actually one of the

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,010
problems in the Drupal ecosystems that

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,290
you have so many modules as so many fief

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,460
tons of development that actually

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,350
getting people to sort of work and

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,910
harmonize together can be really tricky

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,170
that you know you have a bunch of

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,880
different issue queues you have to deal

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,460
with so it's hard to sort of get people

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,990
together but sort of to get into Drupal

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,030
8 that this is a lot of hope the Drupal

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,380
8 solves these problems that having you

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,870
know that sort of based solution you can

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,520
roll with can be really awesome and that

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,050
you know I think a lot of what panoply

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,370
was trying to do drupal 8 already it

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,220
does out of the box and that is

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,530
fantastic so what does it do of course

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,620
you know instead of having just a small

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:24,540
development team we actually have a you

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:26,460
know whole core team oh sorry people or

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,820
not

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:33,780
okay so I blow up for the you wanna

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:37,290
control slides all going down so same

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,700
thing in Drupal 7 sorry that like having

00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,560
a bigger core development team is way

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,390
better like having like the WYSIWYG

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,550
supported by like a like group of much

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,020
larger people helps you know everybody

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,720
sort of contributing extender that

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,760
having contributed of configuration

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,980
management in Drupal 8 core makes

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,620
actually bundling and like setting your

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,020
configuration be really really easy that

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,060
code quality and structure is actually

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,530
improved greatly in Drupal 8 because you

00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,870
have Drupal core standards that are

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,610
imposed you know pretty rigorously on

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,620
all the code that goes in and you have

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,330
that centralized issue queue that

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,500
actually has all the different you know

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,270
people working together so you can

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,580
easily find bugs and track project

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,990
patches and this kind of thing and that

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,060
you have this out-of-the-box experience

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,650
that's really awesome then you know i

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,030
think you know there's a lot of things

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,260
group late can do out of the box and i

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,940
encourage you to sort of go that way

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,890
because this is sort of the build

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,990
methodology that we're trying to present

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,400
here that you know we want when you're

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,560
actually doing a sight i'd like you to

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,840
consider the idea of beginning

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,550
development of just drupal 8 core build

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,800
as much as possible spend as much time

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,290
building out your solution in that core

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,840
solution as possible do add a

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,670
contributor to and maybe custom code if

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,020
you absolutely have to but thanks very

00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,430
critically about that because that's

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,290
code that you're going to be supporting

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,940
and maintaining over the course of your

00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,070
project and handing off to anyone who

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,450
maintains it afterwards they already see

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,890
some people noticing this so this is

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,460
probably the most important slide in the

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:01,320
deck which is that since Drupal 8 is so

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,270
capable of doing so many of the things

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,460
for site building out of the box that

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,410
it's really worth revisiting to see

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,970
whether you can do it out of core rather

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,680
than making your first visit for

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,320
figuring out Drupal 8 to the

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,730
contributory yeah there was if actually

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,660
was a sort of time of someone prior to

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,370
this and they had talked about their

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,530
Drupal 6 site where they had had a

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,540
hundred and sixty six modules on the

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,370
site and they moved over to Drupal 8 and

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,350
I think they ended up with 12 modules on

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,760
the site and that's huge because that

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,710
made a maintenance kind of burden on

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,210
that is way less that I've had plenty of

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,280
frustrations or I have a site with a ton

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,020
of modules and I'll do like ad rush mass

00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,730
update of all the modules and stuff will

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,140
break I don't even know what breaks have

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,700
to like sort of manually go in a date

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,630
update this did it break update this

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,100
okay did

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,250
break when i did this other one at the

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,780
same time it did total disaster this is

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,130
a much i think cleaner approach and

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,080
something that will create more stable

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,000
and sustainable code because the drupal

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,640
8 core process and update process is

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,160
very well tested well supported some of

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,960
the contribs base may not be as much so

00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,940
this is sort of where we're going this

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,260
is sort of the overview of of that kind

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,820
of philosophy i think sort of to get

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,620
into some of the details all sort of

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,540
David in a minute we sort of actually

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,890
decided we built a few sort of Drupal 8

00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,320
projects but we decided to actually

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,240
build an actual group website to sort of

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,640
see could we put this methodology in a

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,380
practice how do we feel about that so

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,570
we're both fans like doing crazy

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,100
projects of course and so we thought

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,530
we'd do like a drupal clone of

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,020
Kickstarter which is a you know

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,970
crowdfunding kind of kind of website you

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,980
post a project and people support it and

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,720
they get some benefits for it and this

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,090
kind of thing and importantly this

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,640
allowed us to pick a set of criteria for

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,220
building a site that wasn't just

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,860
designed from the beginning to be easily

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,600
satisfiable with Drupal 8 it meant that

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,270
we would have to solve some hard use

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,340
cases we'd have to run into a few walls

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:51,170
and we ultimately have to figure out how

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,170
to solve them either with core or

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,530
contribs presentation all without with

00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,970
avoiding writing in a PHP and so we had

00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,650
some problems and content sort of

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,570
solutions we had to deal with we needed

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,280
to have some user you know profiles with

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,440
relatively rich information about each

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,480
person it was like proposing projects or

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,070
supporting projects we had to actually

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,470
have the project's themselves that were

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,270
relatively complicated data models they

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,560
included some videos for people to talk

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,660
about the projects they wanted to be

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,610
fund there's a blog to talk about stuff

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,470
there was categorization the project so

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,700
there is some discoverability we had

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,230
perks where you if you back something

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,490
you actually could get you know some

00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,890
benefit and then we actually need to let

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,720
people back stuff and pay for that as

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,160
well which is you know sort of part of

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,750
the Kickstarter kind of tool set and

00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,220
it's a complicated site they have a lot

00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,870
of developers working on Kickstarter and

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,000
we didn't don't like an exact phone but

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,500
like this is the this is a real use case

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,810
you might actually need to do for

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,950
somebody and beyond just the actual

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,690
content there actually is this

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,010
functionality that needs to happen that

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,600
like people actually do need to actually

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,370
submit a project and have there needs to

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,290
be some sort of review or you know sort

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,040
of process around it even people need a

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,420
postable

00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,370
log with some sort of like you know

00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,380
usability to it you actually need be

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,450
defined fulfil perks as project owners

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,040
in a secure way or you're not like also

00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,630
i am adding perks to other projects

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,980
people need to be able to sign up you

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,720
need to be able to search and you

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,970
actually do that backing and post a

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,550
video using like actual you know secure

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,290
practices of posting stuff online but we

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,120
did build a site this is a our site in

00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,920
question it had that article blog system

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,420
had a project submission workflow of

00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,490
sorts it had a project atomization

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,800
system project Phillips from a filament

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,870
let people back let people pay had user

00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,060
accounts and we had this week based

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,650
theme from symphonies that we found that

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,150
we sort of adapted to make this all work

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,920
with the block system which was really

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,090
great so this is the kind of thing I

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,860
think you could be asked to do for your

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,180
clients and your customers and all I

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,470
turn over to David is sort of walk us

00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:42,720
through that build and some of the

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:44,970
issues we faced with it so this is

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,680
mostly a success story and then we'll go

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,260
into some of the caveats right after

00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,870
where there were some areas where we had

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,310
to wade through a little bit of mud more

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,030
than we think is really ideal for the

00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:59,480
experience so in the spirit of starting

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:03,590
with core we started with drew right

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,730
just pure Drupal installed it and

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:09,230
getting the installed copy is of course

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,420
the first step to success with Drupal 8

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,920
but right after that wow this copy is a

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,260
little small for me to actually see so I

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,550
might have to turn around a little bit

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,250
so one of the first things that we did

00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,020
is we created a project content type the

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,560
backbone of any kind of Kickstarter

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,180
clone is that you have projects so by

00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,190
creating a project content type we would

00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,870
allow people to do things like posting

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,550
the description of the project and one

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,930
of the things that Kickstarter requires

00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,410
these days is listing the risks

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:40,470
associated with the project now Drupal 6

00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:42,120
and even Drupal 7 a little bit this can

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,740
be a little challenging to do especially

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,230
if you want to offer formatting for this

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,580
stuff but in Drupal 8 it's as simple as

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:52,650
adding a second long text field to allow

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,900
people to create a risk section and by

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,480
default that has a GUI interface you're

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,850
able to add bullet points you're able to

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,010
add images all of this is handled as

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,779
part of core so we're actually really

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,580
far along already and allowing people

00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:09,779
post projects to the site format their

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,070
presentation of it and we have a few

00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,359
more things that we want to do with this

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,419
project like allowing people to post

00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,039
videos but we'll get into that later the

00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,679
next thing that really is the backbone

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,690
of a Kickstarter style site is offering

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,219
perks for projects where if you give a

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,460
hundred dollars or more to this project

00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:27,869
you get you know perk x and y if you

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,009
give a thousand dollars you get these

00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:33,629
additional things we can't quite support

00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,279
people paying for them out of court but

00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:37,889
the first thing that we can do is we can

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,080
start looking at how we allow people to

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:43,049
create this and what we did is we first

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,909
created a content type out of the box

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:46,830
that includes a title for it and a body

00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:51,899
that you could include bullet points of

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:53,789
what you get and at this point we in

00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:56,279
terms of very simple State Building with

00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:58,619
just core we have we've installed it and

00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,419
we have to content types the things that

00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,749
we still need to accomplish to get this

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,070
sort of Kickstarter clone going is we

00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:06,899
have to be able to link perks to

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,969
projects people should only be able to

00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:13,379
create perks for their own projects they

00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:16,759
people should be able to buy those perks

00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:19,289
from a project that they're browsing

00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,570
from the listing of those perks on the

00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:23,219
project page and you people should be

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:27,479
able to post a video that's sort of

00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:29,549
showing a preview of their project so we

00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:32,820
can actually still keep trudging forward

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,129
with just core at this point we can

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,019
create a view to list projects what this

00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:38,659
means is we go into the kind of

00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,039
structure of the site we create a view

00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:43,409
some of the basic options for creating a

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,080
view are that it's for content types and

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:47,849
in this case we select up just project

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,349
content types so out of the box this

00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:56,460
view is just going to list all projects

00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:59,489
or sorry perks uh yeah perks so I know

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,019
what they're just getting confused about

00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:02,789
the relationship yes this view is to

00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,950
list projects so that we can associate

00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:06,599
them with the perks so out of the box

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,149
this is going to list all projects site

00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,849
wide but what we actually want to do is

00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:13,769
um if you can quite see it in there the

00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:15,430
name of this view is my projects because

00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,100
you should only be able to create prot

00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,480
perks for your own projects so after

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,950
creating this view we have to do a

00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,540
couple more things before we can

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,150
actually make it so that perch can be

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:28,270
associated with someone's project we can

00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:31,390
create a conditional filter on the view

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:33,880
where we filter for only the projects

00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,650
that that person owns so that means that

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,210
if you created a project before you're

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,520
going to be able to see that project as

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:43,660
one of your options for creating a perk

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,910
and then down and validation there's a

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,210
validator that you would have to have

00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:52,110
edit access to that user that owns the

00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:55,270
project in order to be able to actually

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,740
add perks to that project and this

00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,890
prevents someone from possibly changing

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,880
the parameters of the view and

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,010
introducing a perk for a project they

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,590
don't own this also would mean that

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,820
admins could create perks for projects

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,630
that they don't own but that's okay

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:13,300
because their admins so we've configured

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,740
a couple options in here and then the

00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,230
last thing we have to do is actually

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,850
make it available as an entity reference

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,020
view because out of the box when you

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,270
create a view you only have a couple

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,830
options a page and a block but if you

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,620
want it to be able to be showing as

00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,090
options on something else then you have

00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,070
to create it as an entity reference and

00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,020
then that creates converts this base

00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,840
view into an entity reference entity

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:38,350
reference in Drupal means a relationship

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,270
between one node to another so now we've

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,940
done is we've created the foundation for

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:45,640
us providing an option on another node

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:50,170
to associate that node with one of your

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,610
own projects additionally if you're

00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:54,310
doing an entity reference because when

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,050
Drupal doesn't entity reference field it

00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,850
doesn't auto complete things so you can

00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,520
type in only a few letters of the name

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,590
of something and pull it up so you have

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,610
to specify how what it's searching on

00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,140
and in this case we're just going to

00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,210
have it search by title but we have to

00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,860
actually actively configure that so what

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,200
this means now is that we have a view

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:14,410
that we can make available as a widget

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,170
on another node that will list only the

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,850
projects that owner owns and allow them

00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,650
to do a little autocomplete to pull up

00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,480
the projects that they on and then

00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:26,140
associate it with a and then we're going

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,200
to be associating with perks so the next

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,100
step is pretty straight for

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:35,789
this we add another field two perks that

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:37,919
that is content this just creates the

00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,350
basic reference and then we can

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,019
configure that to use this view that we

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:46,080
created as an entity reference and what

00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:48,929
this now does for perks is in addition

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,850
to having a title for the perk and a

00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:52,799
description of the perk there's now a

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,500
field that is an autocomplete that

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,750
allows you to to link that perk to one

00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,639
of your projects so anyone can now go in

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:04,500
and create a perk for one of their

00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:07,019
existing projects the but this isn't the

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,820
end we we have the perks in the system

00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,889
now but people we want people to be able

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,179
to actually see them next to a project

00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:14,850
so we have to go through a few more

00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:19,260
steps we're going to create a new view

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:22,700
as a block of view that is going to list

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:25,200
the perks for a specific project and

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,710
again we hop back into this kind of

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,419
conditional filter and we this time

00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,590
instead of filtering it by the current

00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:37,769
user what we do is we filter it by the

00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:40,710
the content ID in that reference field

00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:42,840
so what that means is that every perk

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,389
now that gets created is associated with

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,850
a project and we can do this filter in a

00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:49,919
way even just through this GUI in a way

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,690
where we pull up every single perk that

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:57,679
is associated with the project currently

00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:59,789
being viewed and once that is completed

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,760
once we say that we want to filter by

00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:04,830
the actual referenced project we can go

00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,899
in and set the default to be the current

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:10,019
content ID and when you pull up a node

00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:12,059
on Drupal that is the current content ID

00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:14,639
that you can filter by so let's say

00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:18,149
someone pulls up a project page its

00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:19,860
project ide to in the system and then we

00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:22,710
want to find all the perks for project

00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,269
ID 2 and here what we can do is we can

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,970
set up this filter where we pull up

00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:30,960
every prop every perk that is associated

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:34,010
with a project ID 2 and then having done

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,840
this we've created a block in the system

00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,429
this actually used to take an enormous

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,659
amount of work and earlier versions of

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:41,500
Drupal to get this far you would

00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,470
basically have we would have

00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,420
already pulled out the PHP at this point

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,310
but now we have a block and we can hop

00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,100
right over to the block system in Drupal

00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,360
8 now this is a bit different than the

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,850
experience you might have expected on

00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,560
Drupal 7 or earlier because on those

00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,810
earlier releases we sort of listed all

00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,280
the blocks and then their unused ones at

00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,620
the bottom and you could assign them

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,230
somewhere but blocks in Drupal 8 that

00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,900
aren't used anywhere are actually a

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:10,000
hidden and you have to click place block

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,870
before they'll pull up the list so if we

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,990
click place block in the case of the

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,820
default Bartik theme the sidebar second

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,830
is the right sidebar on any kind of

00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,840
layout and by default that has nothing

00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,510
in it so it kind of collapses but if you

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,600
put something in it it will appear so we

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,370
can place a block we can do the block we

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,530
just created which is perks by project

00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:35,740
which automatically shows the correct

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,330
perks for a project and then we can

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,080
restrict it so that it only appears on

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:43,900
project pages so now what we have is a

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,150
setup where when you view a project in

00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,800
the right-hand bar of that project it

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:52,090
will show a listing of all perks

00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:55,150
associated with that project so at this

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,670
point it actually took quite a few steps

00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:59,620
but it was all possible through core to

00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,680
link perks to projects and list them on

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,330
the project page now I sort of picked

00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,710
this as a stopping point because this is

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,750
where we sort of hit a wall with core

00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,370
because we wanted to do two things that

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,980
core doesn't support directly right now

00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:13,740
at least in a really good way which is

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,780
accepting payment for the perks and

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,730
supporting videos on projects you can

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,110
kind of hack those things in like maybe

00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,690
you could put something in the template

00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,790
where you hop over to paypal with a form

00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,710
to pay for something or you could allow

00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,540
people to just drop in an arbitrary URL

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,889
for a YouTube video but we wanted to

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,139
provide a better experience we wanted to

00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,659
validate that data we wanted to make it

00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,100
where it was responsive we're like when

00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,139
someone pulls up a project on their

00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,090
phone it's rendering the video the right

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,470
way for them and on the desktop it's

00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,500
rendering the video the right way for

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:45,700
them and the same thing for payments we

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,649
wanted a flexible thing where people

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,360
could pick currency for their payments

00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,590
and they could pick the actual provider

00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,470
that they were processing the payment

00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,380
through so we'll start with the easier

00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,920
one

00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,690
which is supporting for videos so I show

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,550
the two modules we pull down here you

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,070
can do this in the GUI on Drupal as well

00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,560
on Drupal 8 if you have write access to

00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,420
the file system this I'm just showing it

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,950
here doing it with drush which is a way

00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,290
that you can do it with a command line

00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,610
often this is a really nice and fast way

00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,320
to do it because you don't actually have

00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,510
to download it to your desktop you can

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,560
just browse to you can just connect up

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,850
to drush on a local or remote copy and

00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,830
then tell it to pull down the module and

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,290
drush also pulls down the dependencies

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,520
for you to which is quite nice some of

00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,830
these modules might have two or three

00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,600
other ones that they require as well so

00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:35,990
here I've pulled down two modules I've

00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:39,890
pulled them video embed field and an

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:41,990
payment video embed field also is

00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,300
showing one of the other great things

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,310
that's happened a little bit in Drupal 7

00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,410
and a lot in Drupal 8 which is better

00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,060
extension points for how modules are

00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,610
actually extending the tools that you

00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:55,970
have on the site it used to be in the

00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:58,250
old era of say Drupal or early a lot of

00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,960
Drupal 7 and especially Drupal 6 and

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,630
before that if someone wanted to extend

00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,190
a node like with an edit form or

00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,690
rendering thing they would write a

00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,250
module and then they would do this thing

00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,990
called decorator pattern where they

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,140
would basically have a hook that they

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:14,330
would alter the form or the view of it

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,040
on the fly and it would be very

00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,660
unreliable for integrating various

00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,150
modules because they might be in an

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,980
order you can't control they might have

00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,200
their own individual settings for how

00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,780
what node types they're on or other

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,720
things like that and now with fields

00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,630
rather than trying to push it all the

00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,410
way onto the form something can write a

00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:39,710
widget like payment form or or this

00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:41,750
video field and they can get added

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,050
wherever you want in the form to

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:47,560
whatever content types you want and with

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:53,150
the visualization of it that you want

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:57,470
and so having added the the video field

00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:59,750
we can now add a video embed to our our

00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:02,090
project clinton type and then we can hop

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,220
we can configure that in this case i've

00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,770
just allowed youtube videos it comes out

00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,360
of the box supporting a couple things

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,510
and it has extensions to support about

00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,130
15 other video services but what this

00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,930
means is it'll validate what someone

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,670
throws in there to make sure that it's

00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,470
actually a YouTube video and it's

00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,960
properly embeddable and it will handle

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:25,090
everything from from flash to I frame 22

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,060
html5 embedding of this video in the

00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:30,990
proper format for the proper devices

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:33,640
without me having to write any code so

00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,650
that adds the video field I can go back

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,630
into the interface and then choose where

00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,490
that video field appears when someone is

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,590
creating a project or editing a project

00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,060
I can also drag it up and down for the

00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,830
viewing of our project if I want the

00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,450
video at the very top I can have it

00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,070
there if I wanted at the bottom I can

00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:52,360
have it their all configured through the

00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:53,980
GUI it got a little more complicated

00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,140
when we started wanting to accept

00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,300
payments on things but we started with

00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,590
the same approach where we looked for

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,960
something where we could add it to the

00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,250
perks and in the case of the payment

00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,320
module it provides something called

00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:09,400
payment field which allows you to add a

00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:12,220
payment item to a existing content type

00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,110
in a way that's very lightweight payment

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,090
is also used by the Commerce module for

00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,140
more complicated things but payment

00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,450
module if you just want someone to be

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,850
able to buy one thing that's that's

00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,770
really all you need commerce module ads

00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,900
and things like shopping carts and order

00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,670
tracking and shipping and all sorts of

00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,680
other things that we didn't really

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,240
necessarily want to track for someone

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,290
just signing up for a perk because a lot

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,330
of these perks are delivered digitally

00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:36,550
anyway and a lot of people come to the

00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,590
site and buy one perk and then they

00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,260
leave it's not usually the usual that

00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,850
you would go through multiple projects

00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,980
on Kickstarter in a row and sign up for

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,060
multiple ports at a time you could on

00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,540
this but it wouldn't be through a

00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:52,420
shopping cart so the thing that got

00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,640
challenging here is that payment

00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,380
requires currency for doing conversion

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,730
rates and supporting the different

00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,620
currencies the world and currency

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,790
requires some composure based modules

00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:05,350
how many of you have worked with

00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:08,230
composer ok so like about five to ten

00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:11,260
percent of the people in here composer

00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:13,600
has a complex relationship with Drupal 8

00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,100
and I think this was one of the weaker

00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,650
spots that we ran into with this build

00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,289
because since currency were has some

00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,019
compose

00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:23,719
dependencies neither drush installing

00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:25,759
them nor installing them through

00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:27,559
drupal's own GUI would handle pulling in

00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:28,880
the dependencies which meant we had to

00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:31,369
figure out a way to pull in the composer

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,900
dependencies there are various things

00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,569
that have happened in the ecosystem for

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:39,679
this but we r we still see the anti

00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:41,809
pattern that we saw before with there

00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,929
being different solutions being offered

00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:46,789
in contribs in the life cycle of Drupal

00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:49,189
we're like for example there's composer

00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:50,869
manager which can do the job but even

00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:52,039
the author composer manager doesn't

00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:55,099
think it's really the right way to

00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:56,959
handle composer dependencies so for at

00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:59,209
least this build we decided to go pretty

00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:01,969
lightweight and we basically just pulled

00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:04,189
up the composer JSON file for currency

00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:06,319
and you can find out that something has

00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:08,179
composer dependencies by either trying

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,429
to install it and noticing that it

00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:12,859
complains that it can't install yet or

00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:16,969
looking for a composer JSON file in the

00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:19,849
modules directory in this case so we cat

00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:22,449
to display that file and it turns out it

00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:25,459
has two external dependencies which are

00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:28,609
commerci currency and commerci currency

00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:32,209
exchange both tend to the one point x

00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:34,009
series so we can take that I still have

00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:35,959
the bottom of that file on at the top of

00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:38,269
here just to see that and we can do

00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:39,739
composer require and then add those

00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,829
dependencies which will add them to the

00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:46,939
composer Jason for the basic project in

00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:50,689
the for Drupal this can complicate some

00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:52,189
core updates so we're looking for better

00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:53,869
ways of doing that and this is kind of

00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:55,459
part of the call to action side of this

00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:58,339
stuff of figuring out how this should

00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:59,329
work for Drupal 8 but it does do the

00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:03,529
right thing it pulls down the

00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:05,359
dependencies and we added one more

00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,069
option here that might be useful to you

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,449
especially if you are deploying to

00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:12,109
servers and working on your desktop

00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:14,539
which is the ignore platform rex option

00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:17,150
which basically says to composer even if

00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:21,109
i can't run these these composer

00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:22,459
projects locally that's okay like a lot

00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,259
of composure projects are looking for

00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:26,269
things like PHP extensions or versions

00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:28,009
of PHP that you may not have on your

00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:29,119
desktop and there's no reason you

00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:30,140
actually have to have them

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,089
just talked to install those

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,999
dependencies and commit them to

00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:36,920
something like it so we got those we

00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:38,480
downloaded them we committed them to get

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,819
we pushed them back up to the server and

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,140
then we could install the the modules so

00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:47,779
from there we added the payment form

00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:51,559
field to perks the payment form field

00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:53,180
allows listing doing an item listing a

00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:57,799
total and having a big button to

00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,569
basically say pay for this and then from

00:41:57,799 --> 00:42:01,309
there we basically configured it where

00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:05,569
it would be in the most basic mode

00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:07,970
possible where it would just provide a

00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:12,470
single button for payment with no other

00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:15,380
real options and then in terms of how

00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,660
users actually create their perks what

00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,920
we did is we hid a lot of the fields you

00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,809
would usually use for nodes because

00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:26,089
perks don't really need their own URLs

00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:27,499
and in this case we didn't want any of

00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:30,499
the other fields in terms of authorship

00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:31,940
etc those aren't that important for for

00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:34,279
tracking there it might be nice to have

00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,440
internally but not for display and then

00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:39,009
for the payment form importantly we

00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,200
changed it to a drop-down selection list

00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:44,119
versus the normal view which allows you

00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,519
to put as many line items as you want on

00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,789
it because by its very nature a perk is

00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:51,559
one line item so this means that users

00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:54,200
get a pretty simple form for creating

00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:56,950
them so here's what we see in terms of

00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,789
the final project form we have

00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,369
unfortunately the resolution of this

00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:04,160
kind of mingle a little bit but you have

00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:06,259
the title you have the preview which is

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,289
the youtube link for the video you have

00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:11,059
the body and then you have the risks

00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:12,980
section and we've made the risk section

00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:15,200
required so that people have to publish

00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,269
some risks of them getting the project

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,920
done successfully and this is all being

00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:22,549
delivered in a way where it will render

00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,259
with the video with it has WYSIWYG for

00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:28,609
editing both the risks and the body

00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:30,470
content for it and this gets associated

00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:32,900
with the user in a way where they can

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:36,380
add perks to it later and then the final

00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,210
perk form has the title it has the body

00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,220
to describe describe what the perks

00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,349
are that come with that package and then

00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,859
down at the bottom you can see that you

00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:49,710
can select a currency and put in a mount

00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:51,150
the there's a little bit on here that we

00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,910
probably wouldn't we would have liked to

00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,680
have a little simpler but you can put

00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,280
the currency you can put the amount you

00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,780
can put the quantity and you can put a

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,040
description for how that line item

00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,260
appears when someone actually goes to

00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,349
check out and then at the very bottom

00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:09,510
you actually see the project thing for

00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:11,160
the the reference for that doesn't auto

00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,680
look up so all I have to do is start

00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,780
typing in my space and then it pulls up

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,530
my project I can select that and then

00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:22,380
that creates a part for my project and

00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,510
then the final view of a project view

00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,780
before we actually added in any kind of

00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:30,480
theming is that you can now pull up a

00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,490
project you can see that embeds the

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,220
video properly it shows the description

00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,660
it shows the risks and then on the right

00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:41,430
hand side you actually see the first

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:43,080
perk that we created which is a my new

00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,599
perk and you can see the description

00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,900
that it has and you can see a little bit

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,040
more cruft than we would have liked for

00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,040
the perk in the sense that you actually

00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,280
see a sort of as if it's a order with

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,010
one item in it but this is just kind of

00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,380
emphasizing what direction we would see

00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,869
going forward with theming on Drupal 8

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,400
because traditionally in Drupal 7 and

00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:07,140
before the way you would theme things is

00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,730
you would send a sort of kind of node ID

00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,710
or something very lightweight to the

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,630
theme layer and then the theme layer

00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,980
would often make a bunch of API calls to

00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,140
find all the data that it wanted to

00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,580
actually render and then that meant you

00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,740
had to work with a lot of PHP in the

00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:23,730
theme area the nice thing about this

00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,890
mode here is that this data that you see

00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,080
going in the perk view is what's getting

00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,910
handed to the theme layer and now all

00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,680
that all that's required editing a twig

00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,300
template and removing the information

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,849
that we don't want to render so before

00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,290
you would send a tiny bit of information

00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:39,720
to the theme layer and make a bunch of

00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,000
API calls now what we'd recommend for

00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,859
Drupal 8 is send at least what you need

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,480
in the theme layer and then trim it down

00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:47,640
from there and that makes a much more

00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,160
much clearer development path of how the

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,839
data gets rendered in that twig template

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,849
it doesn't require you to work with any

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:58,380
PHP and in the in the theming layer and

00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:01,020
it means that you can deliver this sort

00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:08,220
of functionality without any PHP at all

00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:11,609
at least that's written by you so we

00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:15,210
with that we will open the floor to two

00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:16,800
questions with just the basic I guess

00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,420
closing statement of like if you're

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,339
building new projects on Drupal give

00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,190
Drupal 8 a shot and give just the

00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:25,830
vanilla cora shot to see how far you can

00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,330
get with that before you dive into

00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,589
contribs and then also of course dive

00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:44,700
into control before you start writing

00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:46,440
during custom PHP yes sir how would you

00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,869
do if you wanted to use something like

00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,050
an entity instead of a node given that

00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:56,250
maybe nodes are entities yes but like

00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:57,540
more stripped-down version I don't know

00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:01,500
if there's a way to do that quite in the

00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,089
GUI the I'm not I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,580
admit that I'm not an expert quite in

00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:07,650
that area but I will say that one thing

00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,390
about all the steps that we took is that

00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,670
you can export the configuration of all

00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:14,220
of that with configuration management in

00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:18,690
Drupal 8 and manage it safely and then

00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:22,349
also for the nodes you do still have the

00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:25,530
ability to to alter things in Drupal and

00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:27,000
provide changed renderings if you need

00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:32,490
to simplify things beyond what you can

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,230
do in the GUI awesome other than that

00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,119
thank you so much for attending our talk

00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,420
and we hope everybody have a fantastic

00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,480
