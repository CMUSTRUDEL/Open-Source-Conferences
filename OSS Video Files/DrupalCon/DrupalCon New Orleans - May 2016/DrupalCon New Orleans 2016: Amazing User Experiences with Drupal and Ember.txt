Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Amazing User Experiences with Drupal and Ember
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	When we combine Drupal 8's strong extensibility with Ember's strong conventions, something magic happens: we get Drupal sites that can be seamlessly extended into the browser, with access to a deep ecosystem of Ember addons that deliver amazing experiences out-of-the-box. All without writing any glue code.

See Drupal like you haven't seen it before, with gorgeous inter-page animations, Service Worker-driven offline capabilities, and in-site authoring tools with instant preview across multiple device sizes.

A Javascript-curious Drupal developer should be able to come away from this session and add new capabilities to their existing D8 site that will make people say "Wow!"

Prerequisites: intermediate experience as a Drupal developer, basic familiarity with Javascript, and a willingness to rethink the boundaries of what Drupal can be.

Topics presented:

Why Javascript circa 2016 is nothing like Javascript circa 2006, and the opportunites this creates.
What is Ember and the Ember community? (We have a lot in common with the Drupal community!)
Demo of new open source modules to easily integrate Ember into a Drupal site, with the ability to gradually and progressively move small pieces of functionality from PHP to Javascript, while still taking advantage of a persistent, in-browser application.
Walkthrough of extending a D8 site to show off animation, interactive editing, and offline capabilities (all source code provided).

thank you and I think we need it's that

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,770
time of the afternoon when you're ready

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,300
to just relax and have a nice slow talk

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,679
that doesn't have too much hard stuff

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,340
and that's not my talk so wake up hi I'm

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,590
ed this is my first drupalcon I actually

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,420
kind of worked with Drupal for the first

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,609
time about 7 months ago and have worked

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,630
on it fairly continuously since then on

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,060
a whole bunch on several different

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:32,219
projects using it integrated with some

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:37,079
fully decoupled ember apps some

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,730
progressively dekalb labs and so I don't

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,500
you know i'm a newbie in this community

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,629
and don't know i've been really

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,480
interested to learn the history and the

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,640
culture and the software archaeology of

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,090
a project like drupal that's been so

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,350
successful for so long it's definitely i

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,820
got interested in drupal and got

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,280
involved with google because i can see

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,899
that this is a community that's kind of

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,309
like the community that I'm spend most

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,040
of my time in which is amber community

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,369
in the sense that it's true community

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,710
open source with long-term vision and a

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,500
willingness to come together and hammer

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,880
out agreements and conventions so that

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,549
we can all stand on the shoulders of

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,119
giants help each other go further so

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:23,790
that's the big commonality that I saw

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,100
that Juve got me interested in Drupal so

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,710
and I want to talk about the second

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,000
thing that's clearly dear to the hearts

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,710
of the Drupal community and the Ember

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,070
community which is that the open web

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,810
platform is like the coolest software

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,030
delivery platform we've ever gotten we

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,100
probably only get one shot at kids the

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,380
web has no gatekeepers nobody owns it

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,729
you can throw a nap up there and

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,920
everybody gets to see it nobody takes

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,820
your revenue right nobody pulls it out

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,850
of the app store when they don't like

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,130
you the web has URLs which are amazing

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,409
and give us such a rich capability to

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,140
deep link from one place to another and

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,880
form what is the the deep interlocking

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,399
of the web that that's the metaphor

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,869
urls are really special and it's

00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,240
actually a kind of an amazing social

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,560
hack that we convinced pretty much

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,420
everybody in the world that they can see

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
a URL on an advertisement I understand

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:16,780
what it is and go there that's pretty

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,670
cool and and the other thing I'm going

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,510
about to switch into contrasting at this

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,310
with knit with native apps some more and

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,010
when we when you compare the web to

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,470
native one of the ways with that with

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,940
our web really shines is when you sit

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,920
down and you think about the first run

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,890
experience of getting introduced to a

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,299
new application on the web right because

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,519
you just go there you follow a link and

00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:41,230
you get it and if it takes two seconds

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,459
to load we say no that's kind of that it

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,620
would should really be a lot faster than

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,569
that but of course on a native app

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,430
what's the experience the first run

00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:49,780
experience right its first is the

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,420
interstitial saying would you please

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,819
install my app then it's okay let's go

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,069
to the App Store let's say install let's

00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,140
say okay let's put in my password let's

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,860
wait for it to download it's probably 40

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,420
or 100 megabytes or a gigabyte and then

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,030
it will finally boot and even the boot

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,890
there is like slow for what on the first

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,840
run slow for what you would get for a

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,540
fast web app right it's a very bad

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,010
experience high very high friction but

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,620
people put up with it because what on

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,109
the second run they've got reliability

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,959
and speed and performance and a really

00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,760
rich user experience and so people keep

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,410
making premature statements about the

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,239
web being dead and apps taking over and

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,220
that's not true the web is going to live

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,230
on and the web is actually rapidly

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,389
catching up in the areas where it was

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,220
behind and staying far ahead in the

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:37,569
areas where I was ahead and the areas of

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,489
his head I already kind of talked about

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:41,799
it's that first grunt experience the no

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,109
gatekeepers the rich interlocking of it

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,220
all so the areas where the web has been

00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:51,970
behind is this idea that we have to have

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:54,340
extremely tiny lightweight experiences

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,049
with very lowest common denominator

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,299
assumptions about the technology and the

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,880
hardware because otherwise you can't

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,100
reach everybody you can't be fast

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,740
those constraints are important to think

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,120
about but they're right the ground is

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,620
rapidly shifting under those constraints

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,210
and if you if you insist that your

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,360
website is never going to have more than

00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,410
800 k of payload you will lose the

00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,910
native apps because they don't have that

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,070
constraint they ship hundreds of Meg's

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,110
and they're built on SDK is that are

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,430
hundreds and hundreds of eggs and they

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,870
have all kinds of capability building

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,150
that that's a developer go further

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,230
faster and deliver better experiences so

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:35,470
the point of what the web platform is

00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,300
trying to do to be that good is to build

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,940
technologies that let us ship ambitious

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,550
applications on the web platform to

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,440
everybody and so that means you

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,450
shouldn't have to worry about keeping

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,880
your app super tiny if you have great

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,190
technologies like the ability to do a

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,380
fast server side render of an

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,670
application that might take a second to

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,920
boot in the browser so the user gets

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,500
their stuff instantly on the first run

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,270
we keep that first run win and then I'm

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,070
the time the second run comes around

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,600
they've already in the background pre

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,640
downloaded everything that you could

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,220
possibly want using a service worker or

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,810
even app cache which gets a bad rap but

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,580
is the widely deployed today and let you

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,110
get reliable that reliable fast

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,680
second-round experience that native apps

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,810
have so that's the big picture pitch

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,590
about why you need to care about

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,970
ambitious applications right so that's

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,980
the story you're competing with native

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:31,270
you're competing with native apps native

00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,590
mobile apps in particular and so I'm

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,000
here to talk about ember today because

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,830
that's the community I've been deeply

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,030
involved with and we're actively working

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,020
on this problem the way I would describe

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,330
what the Emperor community is trying to

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,150
build is that ember is an SDK for

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,040
ambitious applications in the same sense

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,170
that you would use cocoa to make an iOS

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,040
app and you would use the Android SDK

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:56,530
you would use Ember to build that kind

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,750
of application so we're not comparing it

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,760
to websites we're comparing it to

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,320
applications and there's lots of things

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,750
that truly are websites and are good as

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,370
websites and you keep doing the website

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,990
thing on those that's really really

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,220
valuable but I suspect many many of you

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,590
are writing things that are

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,450
the apps or have apps embedded in them

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,610
and you and you struggle with that

00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,920
dichotomy sometimes because it's hard to

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,390
run they'll walk the line if you if you

00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,500
kind of pretend you're not really now if

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,000
you're just a web page with some

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,780
parasitic JavaScript floating around

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,330
that rapidly grows and any long-lived

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,820
successful traditionally server rendered

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,650
website i see has tons and tons and tons

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,180
of JavaScript many at much of it

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,950
redundant because there's no holistic

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,940
picture of controlling it all so I want

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,710
to talk i want to take an example here

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,930
this is so i have a lot of screencast

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,550
here of some demos i want to take you

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,930
through a demo it's going to go into

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,700
some depth my goal here is to show you

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,000
to two things one is that i'm starting

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,400
with this is a completely stock Drupal 8

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,320
website there's this is the Drupal com

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,210
website I got a copy of it asked to see

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,250
if I could demo it so it's written by

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,590
other people not knowing I would do this

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,180
with it it's just it's obviously it's

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,500
modern which is great that's why I was

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,169
the main one constraint was I want to

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,910
pull eight this was started 80 I

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,070
upgraded it to 81 and did just some

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:26,040
minor tweaks to make it all work so the

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:29,530
point is there's nothing up my sleeve so

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,060
how do we evolve this site into

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,380
something that can support those kind of

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,479
rich application experiences I was

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,669
talking about right we want a steady

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,690
evolution so we can keep shipping value

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,400
and features to the users without the

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,200
big bang reboot rewrite the world

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,419
situation right I think everybody knows

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,160
why that's not not the best strategy

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,010
when you have the opportunity to evolve

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,830
instead particularly on the open web

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,510
because the web itself has to evolve you

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,830
can't you could come up with them you

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,840
would come up with a much different set

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,570
of standards if you were inventing

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,250
reinventing HTML CSS JavaScript all from

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,450
scratch to do what we want to do with

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,520
them today you can come up with

00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,070
something nicer but nobody would use it

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,870
and by the time you implemented it

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,610
the rest of the world would have moved

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,260
on 45 or the five or ten years it would

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,390
have taken you so we're all in this

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:22,220
evolution together so first step of my

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,650
evolution here is I'm going to install a

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,530
module let's see ms radios playing do I

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,330
need to click them there we go okay so

00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,630
I'm installing a module is called ember

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,419
and it does very very little really it's

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,220
just adding the libraries in development

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,890
mode how I have it here all it's doing

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,530
is pointing at an a conventional ember

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,100
server and for development server that's

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,360
expects to find so if we go and look at

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,950
what happens when we render our site and

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,750
after I turned out in that module it

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,170
looks exactly the same except it's got

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,000
some broken links to the it's looking

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,400
for an ember server and the ember

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,410
servers is the Ember ember CLI amber

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,850
command-line tool the standard

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,310
conventional way to do the to do

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,550
development on a member app you'll

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,590
rapidly find you know to to throw it all

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,270
the constraints of a really rich clients

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,230
that application you need build time

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:16,640
support you know there's many there's a

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,560
bunch of different competing standards

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,650
in the ecosystem a lot of them have

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,180
their own strengths the the nice thing

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,130
about when you're writing an ember app

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,530
working with ember CLI is that we've got

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,700
the whole community to agree and so the

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,870
way everything is packaged the way

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,730
everything is installed is all very

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,740
standard so there's not not a lot of

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,630
gluing things together so we're going to

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,720
stick with conventions and we're going

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,720
to

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,160
and I can see it on my screen okay so

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,040
what you see here is this is how every

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,570
ember app starts you say em renew the

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,340
name of the app optionally where you

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,590
wanted to go and so when I'm putting it

00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,350
in a directory alongside dr. they live

00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,790
in one repo but I actually tend to

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,100
suggest the teams when they're doing

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,410
this the first time you might actually

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,910
just it might be even some more

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,440
conceptually clear to everybody if

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,730
they're if it's two repos because you

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,430
truly are writing an app if you were

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,480
writing an iOS app you would put it in

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,660
it you would probably treat it as a

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,430
separate thing than your troop will say

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,660
now the deep integration of the two is

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,250
very important and this is a progressive

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,230
decoupling story this is not a fully to

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,000
couple story but the reason I'm

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,320
stressing the idea that you have a full

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,900
application from the beginning is

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,570
because that lets you take advantage of

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,630
all the standard conventions of having a

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:35,170
standard upper application so we're

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:40,080
going to so that we've got our standard

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:42,160
ever application there and let's see

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,310
that it

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,570
Shh

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:50,260
it's funny I can't actually see the

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:53,830
videos on my screen ok so we stick with

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,780
conventions so now when we run our

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,730
application and we can see in the

00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,050
console that ember in debug mode is

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,820
telling us its present it's booting up

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,600
in its booting it's ready to do stuff

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,340
it's not doing anything yet and if we

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,720
start to navigate around there's two

00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,220
things going on here one is that every

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,770
time we navigate the page of course it's

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,900
loading again it's booting again and the

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,050
second is that you'll see when I go to a

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,400
URL other than the homepage Emperor's

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,930
know what to do with it embry is very

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,300
sensitive to the URL that's the whole

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,800
point of being on the web right the

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,090
state your application is going to boot

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,070
in has to be has to be tied to the URL

00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:32,710
so next we're going to install an add-on

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:37,500
that I just shipped called ember hand

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,500
off good and

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:44,379
I would describe every hand off here as

00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,509
analogous to what a uiwebview does on

00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:49,239
iOS right it's the idea that you can

00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,519
embed some existing web things inside

00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:53,290
your app and we have an app and we can

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,389
embed our existing web things in it so

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,720
the point of the the handoff here is

00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:02,829
that we're going to within this browser

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,229
application render the stuff coming from

00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:07,350
Drupal right so this is basically a bike

00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:09,819
turbo links basically like refresh lists

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,649
with a bit of a different philosophical

00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:13,119
flavor in the sense that you're not just

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,970
sending commands from the server and

00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:17,889
driving things from there you're you

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,449
know really driving flow from the

00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:23,979
client-side application and getting data

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:27,069
from the server so so the next thing we

00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:28,419
going to do this is and I know I'm going

00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:29,739
fast enough sharing some code the point

00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:33,489
isn't to memorize and all the points to

00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:34,779
get a feel for the total scope of how

00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:36,069
much code we have to write to go through

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,209
this whole little exercise is going to

00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,809
be very small and then you're going to

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:42,639
see how far we get so this is that

00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:46,389
standard amber router map and what I

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,859
just did there is put in this is

00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,679
referring to that on we just added I'm

00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:52,600
basically saying for a wild card all

00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,519
URLs I don't know anything about them

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,069
here I want to delegate them to the

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,079
handoff at on so will hand them off to

00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,809
the server and there's one Drupal

00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,999
specific thing I did here which is that

00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:05,350
there's this hook that says hey we have

00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,669
a penance on new server content and

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,350
there I get to call Drupal attached

00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:09,699
behaviors and this was wonderful

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,339
discovering all this because Drupal has

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,269
very nice clean abstractions for doing

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:14,559
this stuff because it was already

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:17,799
written for the Ajax support and all

00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:21,759
that it puts you way ahead of most of

00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:24,339
what i find out there in terms of you

00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,409
know server rendered stuff that has the

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,689
Wild West for how all their assets are

00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:32,100
handled and this is great because it

00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:34,480
means everything works so when we go and

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,260
put the app up now

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,839
and we can open up the network console

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,190
and we can navigate around and we can

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,690
see that we're not doing full page

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:48,519
refreshes anymore we're loading

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,899
everything over over Ajax but all the

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,959
JavaScript still works on all the pages

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:55,470
all the way to still work and so we

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,449
didn't have to do much to get here right

00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,740
because and the reason the reason we

00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:01,089
could do this because the hard work is

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,949
pushed into these add-ons and these

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,269
add-ons are very very standard and they

00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,920
can be shared by the community so that

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,760
you could do the hard work once and then

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,380
you could just be up and running so this

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,720
is an inversion of control right from

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,940
the we're starting our project this is a

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,410
progressive project we're not throwing

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,810
away our website and making a whole new

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,699
thing it's very progressive from where

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,320
we are with baby steps but the baby

00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,000
steps have to be going somewhere right

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,610
and the goal is to be able to ship

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,610
richer user experiences better

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,670
performance maybe we want to make our

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,709
appt work offline maybe we want to add

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,019
rich animations and transitions things

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,160
like that so where you're going to

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,050
eventually hit the point where you need

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,019
to have the control happening on the

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,010
client and so it's actually as long as

00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,750
you can make that step in the very

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,870
beginning like this at low cost there's

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:53,350
no reason not to because now you have

00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,760
the option of very piecemeal choosing

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,750
what parts of your application are going

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,980
to be handled where so that's the idea

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,769
and you're progressing toward where it's

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,300
it stored it's basically moving toward

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,889
fully decoupled with the understanding

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,420
that you might never choose to go all

00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,399
the way there but you always have the

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,110
option to take tiny steps any place in

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,459
your application that you need to so

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,470
let's take some more tiny steps into

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:19,389
letting ember understand more about this

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,420
application and have some opinions about

00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:24,150
couch to behave so

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,100
in this I'm adding two new routes to the

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,960
Ember router map before we had one

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,170
wildcard route that would just delegate

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,180
delegated to hand off and it has you

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,380
know this catch-all path the star there

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,300
literally just means you know match

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,940
everything but the two new routes were

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:44,430
adding are just much more conventional

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,530
ember routes 14 showcases 14 case

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:49,260
studies those are two content types that

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:52,260
are already on this site their URLs that

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,400
are you existed and the only difference

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,990
between the two is that one of them is

00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,160
basically static and one has a dynamic

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,730
piece that you can see there's an ID in

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,650
there but they're basically going to

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,940
their fully conventional ember routes

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,380
and so you could just go read the

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,200
standard number guides understand

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,610
exactly how all this works which is a

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,900
really big benefit when you think about

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,900
teaching teams how to do these things

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,920
next I'm taking advantage of ember to

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,110
generate some of the files that are

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,640
going back up these routes this whole

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,930
step is basically just making sure each

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,530
of these routes knows how they load data

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,810
right and so you'll see that we're

00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,340
basically going to tell the Ember data

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,910
system hey please go get me this server

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:39,810
page so there's not a lot of complexity

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,860
here and you know you'll find that what

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,050
we what you're typically doing is you're

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,300
adding a line of code here are there to

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:49,110
express the behavior you want this step

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,090
also gets nicer once we ship a new

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,190
feature called ember engines which will

00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,380
let you just the first step I did where

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,970
I just ready to the router map there you

00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,250
would basically just say mount Drupal

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,990
wherever in many places in the tree

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,040
where you want it that's a really nice

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,970
feature that's coming down the pipe

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,730
pretty soon

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:10,730
alright let's see this is my other rap

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:14,889
very very similar so I'm going to keep

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,889
moving so I run out of time so now

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,919
here's our application it still looks

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,049
the same because the point was that we

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,759
did the same thing except that we now

00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,589
taught amber about the routing a little

00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,909
bit so that it does it has the option to

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,100
do different things on these different

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:31,039
pages now and to show that I opened up

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,730
the Emperor inspector which is a browser

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:39,320
extension that works in Chrome Firefox

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:41,750
ie can remotely debug native mobile apps

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,580
and it gives you a really rich

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,809
interactive debugging capabilities of

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,340
your running application but what I'm

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,629
using it for here is to show what route

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,039
we're currently and as far as embers

00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:52,909
concerned and you can see that it's

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,289
actually changing so that inspector is a

00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:56,539
great example of the kind of stuff you

00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,279
get when you everything's standardized

00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:59,600
because you know you weren't going to

00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,799
find the time and I was going to find

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,269
the time to write a whole browser

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,460
extension just for debugging your site

00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:07,669
but of course if it's very standard the

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,029
community can pull it off the other big

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:13,119
piece of

00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:14,919
finding things in the community is the

00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,989
emperor emperor of Zerva calm is a

00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,809
really wonderful resource that you can

00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:21,429
go find what you need in this case here

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,570
we're going to go just search about

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:24,359
animations because that's what we're

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,950
going to do next with these two grads

00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,049
find the thing we want it's actually all

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,570
curated and there's actually a hand

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,159
review by Katie Gengler who runs this

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,190
website she's amazing and goes through

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:40,859
the hall at an ecosystem to huge

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,859
resource so

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,050
so we went decided we're going to add an

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,280
animation library and so you're just

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,460
seeing the steps that required you do

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,460
that

00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,500
we're writing some animation rules can

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,670
you guys actually see any of that I know

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,800
we're mostly just trying to get the

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,720
flavor you don't have to follow every

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,420
every character the point here is that

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,370
was very declarative and that we're able

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,400
to save save these kind of things about

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,900
our application we haven't gone to cheat

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,880
we haven't changed a single template we

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,930
haven't touched the Dom to make anything

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:25,200
different we just expressed an intention

00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:26,790
and so let's see yeah see you run so

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,500
keep in mind that the two routes that

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,840
are animating are from here to there

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,160
there's the fade right and that's the

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,390
only thing that's animating on this on

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,010
this pass so let's make it cooler right

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,860
you'll see the fade again right there

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,640
okay so that's nice right that's kind of

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,840
cool else have something you can

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,800
normally do let's take it up a little

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:54,570
bit so let's change it so that it

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,730
alternates the reason that is such a

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,560
thing as use and reverse here is because

00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,910
because there's a directionality to the

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,150
constraints who put on this robe we said

00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:06,110
from two so that's how we able to know

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,110
which way it goes and

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,820
let's see

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,680
I don't see that

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:26,910
okay yeah so thank you so this is like

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,320
this is a very rough level of animation

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,059
right this is just kind of the very

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,770
first draft and if you sat down with a

00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,510
designer and developer together and put

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,490
their heads together for an hour to you

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,260
can make this really really nice and the

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,300
kind of things that the reason this kind

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,910
of behavior is important is because of

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,490
the way our human brains work right

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,110
computers are very abstract you're

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,640
navigating through a very abstract space

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,130
when you're moving through a rich

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,890
application it really really helps to

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,300
have spatial metaphors right so things

00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,950
in the physical world don't just appear

00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,360
and disappear that go somewhere and if

00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,340
you can feel like you're going so we're

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,780
on a journey that's a real pneumatic

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,429
help to your mind it really helps users

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:11,360
not get lost so let's take a let's take

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:13,549
it up one more level what do we got here

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,350
oh yeah okay actually I supposed to

00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:17,690
point out a bug on the last slide that's

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,590
why we're adding memory scroll so I

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,220
don't know if you noticed but we're

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:25,610
losing our scroll position and yeah

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:29,660
let's watch that again do I talk to me

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:31,460
not looking at the screen so watch what

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,190
we go for to the lower one here when we

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,470
do red hat it's nice when we go over but

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,670
when we come back and notice the back

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,960
and forward buttons are making the

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,030
animations very correctly but we lost

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,679
our scroll position right that's the bug

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,760
so that's why we're going to say okay

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,440
let's jump let's go to the add-on

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,720
ecosystem again and get an add-on that

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,280
knows how to fix that problem for us it

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,929
is the kind of thing that you get for

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,669
free when every page is a hard refresh

00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:54,080
now you kind of have to manage it that's

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,080
the blessing and the curse of having

00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,490
this my level of control so I'm going to

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,799
go and add this memory scroll add-on

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:06,850
it's going to give us a new component

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,850
we're going to drop it in our template

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,300
and let's see

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,500
I will definitely be posting all these

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,019
via so people could follow them at their

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,909
own pace to I realize it's a little fast

00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:26,549
and disjoint so now we still keep our

00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:29,350
position okay great okay so that so

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:30,490
that's a kind of nice illustration of

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,580
the power you get once you have a

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,019
client-side application running all of

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,269
all without having we didn't touch a

00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,320
single thing and we didn't change

00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,779
anything at all in Drupal i installed

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,419
one module right that just added some

00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:44,830
JavaScript so next step I'm going to go

00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,649
a little I am going to go touch Drupal a

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:52,179
little more and I'm going to add some

00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:54,659
stuff to some templates just some data

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:54,659
attributes

00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:03,000
a small thing that's going to make it

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:03,000
easy to do the next the next animation

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,380
which is we really want to be able to

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,230
target specific things semantically we

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,400
want to be able to express a rule that

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,710
content on one page and content on

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,900
another are semantically related that's

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,730
why I added those data attributes so

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,900
this is the this is like the most

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,160
complex this is the most complex

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,160
animation going to show you I won't go

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,590
further than the signing but the intent

00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,940
is that we're going to find whenever

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,730
we're transitioning between these routes

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,170
things that match each other and that's

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,000
what the explode rule here does it

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,620
explodes out the pages and tries to find

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,480
pieces that go together and then it's

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,490
going to delegate any matches it finds

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,350
to another rule called fly to sew and

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,270
this final step here is what happens to

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:52,060
the things that don't get matched so

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:55,260
basically the background all right

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,260
so let's see that one

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:14,900
Yeah right so this is how we beat native

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:17,210
mobile apps right because they get this

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,440
stuff in their SDKs that's what we need

00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,950
to build that's why we need these kind

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,320
of things so and we might as well for

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,120
completeness we're going to just copy

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,910
that block and do the reverse too so it

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:32,420
goes back and that just basically means

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,920
flipping flipping two bits here the

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,690
moving side thing by the way is just

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,910
basically you know we have an old in a

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,380
new state that we're comparing which one

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,150
flies across is what we're deciding

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,560
there so in this case you really want

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:47,480
the bigger image because that's going to

00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:49,040
look nicer so now goes both ways and and

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,430
notice I can do it with the forward and

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,870
back buttons or buy more with the links

00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,640
it's all actually driven by the URL

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,410
doesn't there's not like click handlers

00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,410
here it's all driven by the URL

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:08,880
so this is one kind of progressively

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:11,640
enhancing an existing application let's

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,500
go more baby steps how would you choose

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,290
to start implementing chunks of the

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,090
actual Dom here within with a member if

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,620
you wanted to get to move some of that

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:25,260
functionality to the client for some

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:27,150
kind of rich behavior so here here I'm

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,830
adding one element to a twig template

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,330
and this is probably not how we want to

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,370
do it I think what we really want to do

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,250
is use the progressively d couple blocks

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,810
module to drop a block here right that

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,340
says here's where I want to put this

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,330
ember app and it sounds like I just need

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,350
to integrate with those guys because

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,930
they've already done all that work for

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,880
that piece of it but in this case I'm

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,100
just dropping some stuff into a twig

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,710
template and I'm binding in some state

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,150
and i'm naming which emberton whichever

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:58,970
component i want to use and i can pass

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:58,970
arguments to it and then

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm adding one extra thing so what we're

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,990
looking at right here is actually the

00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,660
top level template from amber

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:11,910
application this is this is basically

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,309
just my one hook to for that handoff

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:16,260
add-on to have an opportunity to stick

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,730
things places so far I hadn't really

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,540
been I hadn't stuck it in any templates

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:23,640
anywhere and so this is a fairly clean

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,440
public API way to be able to inject

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,030
content you need to be in a template

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,140
somewhere so we're putting wntd we're

00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,580
created putting essentially what looks

00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,620
like a tag at the very top level

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,330
template or application it doesn't

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,669
generate any Dom right there it's more

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:37,110
of a behavior but I'm showing all of the

00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:38,760
all of these little details just because

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,980
I actually wanted to show that all the

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:46,169
steps I'm not hiding steps here I mean

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,970
I'm hiding like CSS that's it well yeah

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,010
that's it right yes yes s not a small

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,020
thing but it's very small amount to CS

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,100
it's not liking keyframe animations or

00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:58,500
anything like that that's all in the

00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:00,480
JavaScript so it worked because it made

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,730
us get an error so now when we render

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,480
this page we see an area that ember says

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,620
there's no such component all right so

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,900
it's good that it found it that was the

00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,419
point so now we're going to generate

00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,870
that component will say amber generate

00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,250
component case study editor I called it

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,070
that because it's you know you could

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,929
conceptually evolve to replace the thing

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,650
that's already on the page there that's

00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,650
running the case study

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:32,230
so we'll give it a template and will

00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,520
bind in some of the actually the actual

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,630
argument got to show that it's there and

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,030
it's there so that's good so now this is

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,010
a case where it's going to render on the

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:46,570
client after that HTML has come across

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:49,900
and but I want to point out it doesn't

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:53,830
have to be that way all of this works

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,750
nicely with fastboot you know or any

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,549
kind of server-side rendering the idea

00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,929
being that if you want to run note

00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,000
infrastructure in front of your drupal

00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,440
infrastructure that HTML could already

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,700
be in the page when it hits the client

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,610
so that even somebody with JavaScript

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,130
off still gets that chunk of content it

00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,020
can be a fairly transparent process as

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,789
far as Drupal's concerned because you're

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,140
conceptually the browser has everything

00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,220
it needs to know to take the JavaScript

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,020
and the data and put them together and

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,820
get that Dom you can just do that move

00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:23,890
that step one step closer into this into

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:25,900
the grab so let's um but let's make this

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,169
thing actually get data and really talk

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,309
to to Drupal in a meaningful way so I'm

00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:32,080
going to install another drupal module

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,880
this is the second one we're added the

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,710
first was just adding the libraries this

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,260
was actually the JSON API implementation

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm working on I want to get it beat

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,110
make it an official project I heard

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
there might be well have been floating

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,150
around it would be a very happy to

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:50,020
collaborate come talk to keep got one

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:52,690
json api is a standard relatively young

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,210
younger than Hal which is often compared

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,640
to and tried to build off of some of the

00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,320
things learned by how it's a bit it's

00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,659
more opinionated in the sense that it

00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,580
specifies more things and it talks a lot

00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,380
about the kinds of both read and write

00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,659
operations that are allowed and how they

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,730
should happen and by standardizing on

00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:12,520
that you get really nice properties in

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,640
terms of the plug and play ability of

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,820
code on the browser and code on the

00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,440
server to talk to each other so that's

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,390
JSON API

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,750
now that we've got it I can't actually

00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,810
see what's becoming

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,810
you

00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:46,639
okay so I'm adding I'm adding another

00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:48,739
out on here this one's called card stack

00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:50,089
CMS and I was as soon as I named it my

00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:51,409
collaborator point out it's a terrible

00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,389
name because it's not a CMS it's more of

00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:55,940
a tool for talking to CMS's so call it

00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:58,009
cardstock editor I wrote it along with

00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,409
another group of great people where we

00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:03,519
are card stacks syndicate we're all

00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:06,409
really independent developers designers

00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,259
strategists who come together to do big

00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:11,959
projects together and often try to work

00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:13,969
on what kind of stuff that will push

00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:15,289
forward open source ecosystems so we

00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:17,329
tend to do take on projects where the

00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:19,099
client is happy to get their product

00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,690
built and generate a whole bunch of open

00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:25,549
source as a side effect so this is this

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:31,129
is an example of that so yeah so we've

00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:33,409
got a nice tours and stuff now now we're

00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,759
going to mark up this is so this is I'm

00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:35,959
going to just drop this template on you

00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,869
it's the most complex when you'll see

00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:42,320
this is where I'm actually using that

00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:44,389
library to do to say I have a CMS

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,979
editing capability here and I'm going to

00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:49,159
pull fields from the CMS and bind them

00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:51,320
into the DOM and a cool feature of this

00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,629
well 22 cool features one is that you

00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,339
can at compile time take out all of

00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:57,739
these annotations so that the DOM is

00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:59,299
perfectly clean but the others that even

00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:01,729
for an editor the Dom itself is

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,459
perfectly clean all of these this markup

00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:06,139
is purely behavioral you know the

00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:07,399
running jet because you've got the

00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:09,019
running JavaScript on the page you can

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,179
keep references into the into the Dom

00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:13,099
without having there's no container div

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,690
right there's no extra markup just to

00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:16,940
support editing so you don't break your

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,369
see it you don't break your CSS because

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,709
the editor view and the not an interview

00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:24,249
are different they're all the same time

00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:24,249
and so once you have that

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:33,460
now the editing tools are aware of that

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,770
content and they can interact with it

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,180
okay and so we can actually go if we

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,400
flip editor mode on we can actually

00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:48,560
touch the page itself and get those

00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:49,610
fields and and when I hit update here

00:31:48,560 --> 00:32:00,200
it's really going all the way back to

00:31:49,610 --> 00:32:02,630
Drupal that's a JSON API patch I'm going

00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,670
to switch over quick to another piece of

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,660
demo which is that I have a full an

00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:12,800
actual application that we've shipped on

00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,420
this kind of technology I'm going to see

00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,130
if I've got enough internet to make it

00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,250
look nice so this was this was the

00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:21,500
client of the American Institute of

00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,600
Architects was willing to take a chance

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,490
on us building all this crazy stuff for

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,210
their reinvention of their online

00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:31,160
experience for their members and so what

00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,890
this is you could go to this URL it's a

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,270
real site it is all fastboot rendered so

00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:38,210
if you hit it with JavaScript off you

00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,010
get all this content but it's an it's a

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,970
full this is a fully decoupler lumber

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,490
out because we stood we're starting

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:47,120
greenfield but if I if I go to the login

00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:49,730
experience so here's a case where I'm

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,040
already logged in I can go there here

00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,720
and activate those tools again and you

00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,190
can see much more richly these are all

00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,550
the fields coming off the content types

00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:00,410
in Drupal there the fields on the right

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,910
here i discovered dynamically based on

00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,530
what's in the template so they're not

00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,830
necessarily a hundred percent of what's

00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:09,650
on the content side the UX strategy here

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,940
is that some things you always need and

00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,800
they go under editorial if they're

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,870
something that doesn't go in the

00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,039
template all right so i can choose to

00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,999
like if i go turn editing on

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,899
remember not to save this because this

00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,899
is their actual website

00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,870
I've got things here like you know this

00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,220
is actually talking to these are actual

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:34,720
you know this is a real taxonomy coming

00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:38,920
out of Drupal I can add and remove

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,290
things like its search for things all

00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,420
that stuff that's all powered by JSON

00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:47,050
API talking you know fetching taxonomy

00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,700
terms and vocabularies and all these

00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,040
like these also are basically all driven

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,120
by taxonomy so a site builder can go and

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,540
change taxonomy and change these

00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,400
controls certainly this is not the end

00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,809
of the end game for where I think Drupal

00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,090
can go with this because this doesn't

00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:02,320
give the level of flexibility to a site

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,130
builder that you'd have if you were

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,290
purely surrendered the the pitch here is

00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,909
that to go and do something to go and

00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,669
make ambitious changes you do end up

00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,740
writing templates handlebars templates

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:16,119
you shouldn't have to write code you

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,460
just need to do handlebars markup which

00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:19,840
is pretty comfortable for a designer if

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,060
they get somebody to help them get

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,060
started that's an area I'm really

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,950
excited to push further you have really

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,929
like dead simple out of the box set ups

00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:30,609
so that somebody who's comfortable HTML

00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,560
and CSS should be able to jump into an

00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:34,869
application like this and do anything to

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,909
it and I think like end you know with

00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,649
things like decoupled box and all that

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:41,600
stuff we can go much much further in

00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:46,290
terms of plug and play

00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:48,030
and this can also be viewed in like all

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:52,770
the other formats that it comes in the

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:56,760
cards and different devices and stuff so

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:58,740
and I have here's my content library

00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,390
it's gonna I don't know if the Wi-Fi

00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,740
here's fast fo here it's finding me this

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:05,880
is all the recent stuff isn't published

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:07,350
we can go find it and I can create any

00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,950
of these are all my content types i can

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,330
create new ones from here so it was a

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,760
pretty cool project we were really

00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,680
grateful to the organization for taking

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,720
it chance on it this technology really

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,100
is paying off and as i said that you

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,140
know it generated all this great open

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,840
source because the underlying tools are

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:29,040
now we're open sourcing them so i have

00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,890
links here on my last slide to the

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,660
things that are already open source here

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:39,210
we're not playing again forward so I'm

00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,950
handoff is the thing I basically what's

00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:46,290
implementing all of the turbo linksys

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:47,520
refresh behavior here I really wanted to

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,990
actually just build it off the existing

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,070
refresh this module but we need to do a

00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,570
little integration work to make that

00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,010
work I think we'll still get there

00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,290
because we can we can get a little more

00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:57,210
efficient than we are now it's right now

00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,130
completely agnostic about Drupal which

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,840
is actually kind of a positive for your

00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,360
front of perspective of it actually you

00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,770
can the module encode some things that

00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,050
are specific about Drupal today but it's

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,450
very small amounts and it's actually

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:12,240
just speaking HTTP it's hey great we

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,680
have standards you know HTML is pretty

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,050
standard you can actually fetch it from

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,430
fetch a blog from the server and the

00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,080
semantics are well defined enough to

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,250
pull out the script do the right thing

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,780
with them pull out the stylesheets

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,480
figure out if you insert some takes them

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,860
away so it's pretty cool card sexy ms

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,790
here as i said it's kind of a bad name

00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,860
will probably call it credits like

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,260
editor instead that's all those toolbars

00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,480
you saw and the overlays that highlight

00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,000
where your content is and lastly Gore's

00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,450
ember jas because is all a very stock

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,040
and wrap very much by design so I

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,040
that leaves me some time for questions

00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:06,150
yeah if so do you want one is the mic

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:08,100
thanks so if you wanted to play with the

00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,370
version of Drupal that you had just

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,960
demoed is that available someplace um

00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,400
can I ship that code it's not my wasn't

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,070
my kite but yeah okay I will absolutely

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,450
post it sure I just didn't know because

00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:23,820
I just like hey here's a dump of this

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:25,500
site I Drupal com so we gotta check I

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,090
can certainly all the part all the stuff

00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,770
I wrote i will certainly can share i

00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,210
will rip out and share because that's

00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,480
that's the interesting part anyway right

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:35,480
i didn't do much with the drupal site

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,480
absolutely

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:44,869
I did it yeah I upgraded drupalcon 2814

00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,369
that and not even like I needed any

00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:47,630
features it was just well I was trying

00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:49,900
to use refresh this and refreshes he

00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,519
didn't oh well but it wasn't that hard

00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,869
so I I definitely have more code to

00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,069
share the initiated here for examples I

00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:58,460
don't have a link to the JSON API

00:37:55,069 --> 00:38:00,440
magellanic so I I know I just want to

00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:05,299
work with actual drupal.org to get it on

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,069
there we should just do that yes I was

00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:09,619
wondering if you could comment about

00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:11,990
versioning a number and share just like

00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:13,819
how that works I I think that's one of

00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,049
the biggest cultural differences for

00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:17,630
Drupal developers and it might be useful

00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:20,569
for people here yet yeah so you said

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,599
versioning right yes so ember you ever

00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:25,249
took a key from the way projects like

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,099
chrome release where they've got

00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:30,170
channels and a very fixed schedule so

00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,680
there's canary releases of Ember

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:36,440
basically all the time weekly at least

00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,799
and then we do we branch branch of beta

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,170
basically every six weeks and then that

00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:43,700
would go able to go through a beta cycle

00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,130
where there are weekly updates to the

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,450
beta cycle and then after the sixth week

00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:50,140
we've higher not enough of the bugs that

00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,759
way it goes to stable and so there's a

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,789
stable release basically every every six

00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:57,349
weeks now that said we know that's a

00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:00,559
really fast cadence for a lot of people

00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:02,299
and so we also have long-term support

00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,009
releases which are spaced out much more

00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,009
and you basically end up with

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,980
and these and these are even firm these

00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:12,570
are basically cember minor releases so

00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,130
they don't actually break anything but

00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,630
we still support them at least 18 months

00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,490
and the ones that break things the

00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,770
actual major releases we've really only

00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,970
done that once so far and we don't

00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,410
really want to do it again if we can

00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,690
avoid it there will probably be a number

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,060
30 but like we don't have to rush we

00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,620
have a lot of we've built a lot of

00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,790
capability and for ourselves to strip

00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,160
out the things we don't need that's

00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:37,200
really our goal so that you can pick and

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:39,870
choose so compatibility wise we're very

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,450
very serious about not breaking people's

00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:44,190
apps and we're really proud that most of

00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:47,940
the ecosystem has been able to keep up

00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:50,310
with us you know we just did a community

00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,710
survey and like seventy percent of the

00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,870
people who responded or up into the two

00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,460
x series which was just great especially

00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,500
since like we all feel like we could

00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,920
have done even better at the 20 boundary

00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,420
but it worked out so so versioning is

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,950
very serious I encourage you to check

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,900
out the builds and release pages on

00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,180
average ember.js calm because it's all

00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:15,690
kinds of Doc's about the process and how

00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:18,120
things happen yes hi just wondering if

00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:21,990
you think there's any possibility for

00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:25,290
template system agnosticism in amber's

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:27,480
future yes handlebars looks like a very

00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:29,640
friendly templating system it looks

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,890
pretty similar to twig yeah I'd be a

00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,140
little bit concerned with two templating

00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,300
systems that are very close but not

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,460
quite the same right exactly confusing

00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,100
yes so the syntactic differences are

00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,600
very small and people haven't have at

00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,360
various times supported alternate

00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,980
alternate syntax is with number there's

00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,570
none that are really kind of live and

00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,490
active right now because the people who

00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:55,500
were cared about them didn't have the

00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:57,240
time so there's today it's it's an

00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,460
upstream struggle to try to have your

00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,500
own syntax but it's getting a little

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,120
easier because so glimmer two is the

00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,730
name of the new rendering engine that's

00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,030
currently on in Canary and we're working

00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,030
on

00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,670
having caught that listen to mostly just

00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,860
to the end to end of the last talked it

00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,150
was very much the same themes all of the

00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,730
everybody's cares a lot about

00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,830
performance on front-end rendering and

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,150
there's only you know the constraints of

00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,180
performance or pushing everybody to

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,400
convergence solution we have a very

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,320
aggressive precompile that happens to

00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,510
build time we have a jit that runs at

00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,520
runtime to optimize templates templates

00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:36,310
are actually an OP there's an opcode vm

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,380
that actually emits the code that alters

00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:40,120
your dom in the minimum possible way and

00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,280
it also and while it's emitting that

00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,780
it's emitting the update code so that it

00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,630
knows what could possibly change in the

00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,580
future there's if you're curious about

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,160
glimmer to there's some extremely

00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,080
in-depth head spinning talk from a

00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,260
macaque this past year with Godfrey and

00:41:53,080 --> 00:42:00,090
yehuda you can check it out I brought

00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:02,710
that up though because glimmer too is a

00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,960
much cleaner low level abstraction then

00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,100
the planets predecessor and I think it's

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,600
going to stay that way because we've

00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,450
learned enough like this is this one is

00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,610
really actually good good enough to

00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:15,070
expose as public API so the goal is that

00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,720
there's a lower level API to use for

00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,340
expressing ember templates that is lower

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,200
level than handlebars which would make

00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,810
it much easier to support an alternative

00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,750
syntax all that said the syntax isn't

00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:27,370
really the hard part is the semantics

00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,320
right so the hard part today of making

00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,450
twig stuff work on the ember side is

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,700
actually the semantics of the data and

00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:37,570
the helpers and the functions all that

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,620
stuff so that will be you know work for

00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,540
sure

00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,730
overall I think it's very very clear

00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,950
that if you that you you will either

00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,600
always have nothing but twig or you will

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,830
have twig and something else for a long

00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,420
long period of time because like a

00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:55,350
cutover is not possible like that's the

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:57,990
evolution story right so as we think

00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,760
about how to we need to think about what

00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,150
would be a wonderful perfect vision but

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,620
also what would be step one and I think

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,910
step one probably involves two

00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:10,710
templating systems that's does my guess

00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,810
yes I just had a question about the card

00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,190
stack CMS the live editing is really

00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:16,350
awesome does that take into account any

00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:23,100
kind of revision aid system within the

00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:24,810
CMS so today I guess it is actually yes

00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:28,200
the revisions are visible in Drupal so

00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:30,060
you know it's using theorem it's very

00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,280
similar to the kind of way the rest

00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:36,300
existing restful services module would

00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,170
manipulate entities and somebody who

00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,280
knows those way better than he can

00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,220
correct me if I'm wrong but you get

00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,810
revision history out of that right

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:45,750
island like a new revision for each

00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,910
field at it well that's actually why we

00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,410
chose not to auto sync every single

00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,060
thing every single keystroke okay

00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,500
because that's an option here we can do

00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,330
that but then your revision history is

00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,610
insane that's why you have the big blue

00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,900
button for update alright and so that

00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,190
would create a checkpoint friend you

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,270
would get revision out of it would be

00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,950
absolutely sure there's no reason it

00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,990
can't I don't know off the top my head

00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,430
if the existing one does that JC an

00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:07,560
Afghan module definitely needs work to

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,090
be production quality it's like there's

00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,250
no configuration capabilities yet you

00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,329
have to go and tweak stuff to set it up

00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,200
play on it

00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:16,200
thanks

00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:23,160
alright

00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:25,229
well nobody asked me anything like

00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:34,619
incendiary like why aren't you as good

00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:36,299
as react but mostly that comes down

00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,279
mostly that comes more down to like the

00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:39,420
structure of communities you know I put

00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:41,700
my weight in with ember community

00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,170
because of the the philosophy and the

00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,640
community more than more than the

00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,049
technology at one point in time which

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,319
six years ago when i was getting started

00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:51,749
with very different technology so i put

00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,190
my bets on on people and shared values

00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:55,880
and philosophies and that's that's why

00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,880
I'm happy where I am

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,760
