reach out to me so to go ahead and get

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,659
started here many of you know this i'm

00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:43,200
not going to try to preach how to market

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,329
your company how to go about sponsoring

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,509
event because you guys have you know

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,310
either marketing team that takes care of

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,350
this or you already know this because

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,899
you're educated person and you started

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,240
your own business so i'm going to lay

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,389
off on teaching you or trying to tell

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,609
you what to do basically I'm just try to

00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:06,209
give you some more guidelines and then

00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:11,480
dive a little bit deeper into drupalcon

00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:14,100
specific goals or tools so just from

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,240
working over to pecans a couple past

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,310
couple years and

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,410
working with some people that have been

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,290
there for since the beginning we've kind

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,590
of narrowed down the steps of success

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,360
and first thing you got to start with is

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,190
just really understanding the Drupal

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,610
community and understanding what true

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,220
pecan is all about if you are a Drupal

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,650
shop or a Drupal agency you probably

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,370
probably already have a grasp on this

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,020
it's pretty unique community as many of

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,930
you know and it's a very large and

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,520
diverse and global community but if this

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,440
is your first time sponsoring an event

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:55,410
and you're just now diving into the

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,720
Drupal market or the Drupal audience I

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,200
recommend just doing as much research as

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,810
you can and you can go to tupelo org you

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,220
can contact us you can reach out to your

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,190
context I highly recommend doing as much

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,610
research as you can because this isn't

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,130
your average tech conference the next

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,980
step is a success is to really define

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,830
your goals and it's important to define

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,290
your goals before you attend the

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,850
drupalcon and well before you probably

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,040
already have these in mind and you guys

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,800
probably understand this already but you

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,150
know your goal should be measurable and

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,860
you should already know how you're going

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,510
to measure these goals so at the end of

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,390
the conference you know what to look

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:43,740
back on determine if it's like success

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,680
or not you might find that you find

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,480
successes in fields you weren't

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,310
expecting so that's just an added bonus

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,330
but when you're able to really look back

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:57,420
and look at the numbers or see some

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,100
sense of achievement it really helps put

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,020
things into perspective zat the end of

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,540
the at the end of the show when you're

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,360
trying to wrap things up after this

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,220
chaotic and exciting event and it's

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,890
important that your entire team is on

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,209
the same page as well so if you are

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:17,280
leading this sponsorship make sure

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,850
everyone that is attending or everyone

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,860
that is back home promoting your

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,919
presence here at rubicon knows what the

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,270
goal is and make sure everyone is on the

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,139
same page when it comes to your

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,060
messaging so that's when it comes to

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,830
oh that's what brings us to our next

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,779
point which is just to define your

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,930
message this is really more to keep it

00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:42,219
consistent nothing's worse than

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,279
switching your messaging switching your

00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:47,979
branding from person to person or you

00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,080
know not being clear on why you are

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:52,960
there or what you can do for the people

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,249
attending and it's important that

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,659
everyone's on the same page again

00:04:54,249 --> 00:05:00,400
because you're not always going to be

00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:02,979
there if someone's talking to you know a

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,930
prospective client or a current client

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,150
and they're saying something different

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,060
than what you're saying so take some

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,819
time I always recommend sort of what we

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,180
do is just you know set up meeting

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:18,550
before before you attend and kind of

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,330
just go over it step by step make sure

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:25,419
everyone's on the same page and you know

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,550
this helps expand your presence at

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,650
rubicon because if people are attendings

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,550
friends attending sessions you know

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,379
that's just another opportunity to

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,110
increase your presence and increase your

00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:40,389
exposure there a triple cons so no

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,150
define your goals define your message

00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:47,289
and more importantly just be proactive

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:51,009
about everything you know drupalcon is

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:55,839
sort of a platform for you guys just as

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:58,509
Drupal is a platform we hope that we've

00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,839
provided all the tools for you you know

00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:03,159
the community is coming it's gathering

00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,110
so now that you have the tools it's

00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:09,120
really what you're going to are what are

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,800
you going to build out of it um it's

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,779
very important that you take full

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,969
advantage of drupalcon so that's why I

00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,139
put that little note at the bottom you

00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,819
know it's one thing if you're a boo

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,319
sponsor and you're only focusing on your

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,300
booth but there's so much more to

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,629
drupalcon there's so much more that you

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,750
can do that if any sense beyond you know

00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:32,560
your daily activities so be proactive

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:36,789
you know prepare know your game plan

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,969
during and always always as you may as

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:42,639
well know follow up on what you've done

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,919
when you're done with drupalcon

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,229
so the first thing I want to cover is

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,030
the first step is just understanding to

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,159
a pecan and understanding the Drupal

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,020
community I just pulled this little

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,449
quote from the website you know Jubal

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,729
Khan is premier conference to hone your

00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,479
Drupal skills connect with the community

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:03,129
and learn about the future of web

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,860
technologies happening on the jewel

00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:09,039
platform and so this kind of gets the

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,550
first point drupalcon add Rubicon Drupal

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,710
is king I mean this conference is

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,550
literally put together surrounding this

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,740
one technology there's one piece of just

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,189
one project so if you're coming in

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,789
hoping to discuss other technologies up

00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:30,849
there or just you know where the CMS

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,949
market is in general you know it may not

00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,650
be as well as receive these people have

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:39,039
committed a lot of time and a lot of

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,039
effort and sometimes money into Drupal

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,520
so this is where why they are here so if

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,529
you are a you know a software that

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,960
integrates with Drupal keep your

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:54,580
messaging surrounding Drupal and if

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:58,000
you're a an agency you know that offers

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,529
a wide range of services stick to Drupal

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,740
case studies you know what have you done

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:05,919
with Drupal prove that Drupal is you

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:12,729
know a great solution for whatever the

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:14,649
problem is at the time i put this quote

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,319
here come for the code stay for the

00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:20,620
community it's kind of the mantra around

00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,020
rupal because it's so true so many of

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,300
these people have came you know started

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,930
rupal because it's a great platform it's

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,789
great tool it's a free it's a great way

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,430
to start a business so if you are a

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:36,339
Drupal agency you know you have this

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,140
free tool at hand but it's really so

00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:41,050
much more than that so a lot of these

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:45,190
people are coming for the community side

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:47,860
of things as I mentioned before this is

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,920
a volunteer-driven project for people

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,610
are investing so much money so much time

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,120
so much of their effort into making it

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,190
better so really

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,880
try to stay around that don't interfere

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:06,250
with these people are here for the

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,270
community it's a community-driven event

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,170
just like it's a community-driven

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,450
project so instead of interfering and

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,690
trying to you know really capitalize on

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:21,260
this gathering you know ask more what

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,300
you can do for them just like in the

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,130
Drupal or just like how an open source

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,750
project work everyone contributes

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,880
everyone shares their knowledge

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,690
everyone's trying to make everyone else

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,990
better for the greater good so take your

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:40,600
sponsorship as an opportunity to reflect

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:46,130
this you know what can your software do

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,310
to make them better at rupal or to make

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,380
it easier for them what can you do you

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,010
know what what are the experiences you

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,110
can share as a Drupal agency that other

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,860
agencies can learn from that will

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,260
ultimately progress the project and if

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,240
you don't know um you know if you don't

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,040
know what the community is all about if

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,950
you don't really know what you can do or

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,779
how to tailor your messaging you know

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,720
find out again this goes back into the

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:17,990
research there's triple org that is you

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,610
know the home base for the tuba project

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,630
where people are communicating on a

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,880
daily basis go in there and ask ask

time and you know Taylor your messaging

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,930
to this again if you are a Drupal shop

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,930
and you're heavily involved this might

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,839
meet sound pretty obvious but if you're

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,459

well figure out what Drupal is all about

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,380

understand the true pecan environment

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,319
the Drupal community before you go in

00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,019

attendees time no one wants to be sold

00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:38,269
to while they are trying to have fun and

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,389
educate themselves so you know do your

00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:45,919
prep work and you know find out if you

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:47,600
don't know so now into the next step so

00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,939
this is I know you guys all have your

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,439
own goals in mind so I'm going to try to

00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:56,329
briefly cover this but over our time

00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:59,389
putting on these events we've really

00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:02,059
nailed down what the four main goals

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:04,279
that people are sponsoring for this is

00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:06,709
based on what we've asked people just

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,989
are seen organically and so this is

00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:12,439
going to be business acquisition and get

00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:13,999
a development so you know business'

00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:18,439
ition is obviously any new business

00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:20,689
business development can be business

00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:22,819
that you already have or business that

00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:25,399
are is in the pipeline that you're

00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:28,009
trying to work on networking and

00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:33,230
partnerships so this is networking with

00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:35,439
other Drupal leaders are networking just

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,779
within the general Drupal community or

00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:41,509
partnerships it's huge I drupalcon we

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:44,989
like to really foster this environment

00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:47,839
where you know just where just as Drupal

00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:50,329
itself as a you know sharing and

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,399
partnering and teaming up project you

00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:55,999
know a lot of shops a lot of companies

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,519
partner together so if you're a software

00:12:55,999 --> 00:13:01,059
integration company sometimes it's you

00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,279
know it's important to team up with a

00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:06,379
Drupal shop to launch a product because

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,899
they know the Drupal environment anyone

00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,389
or maybe you're too small Drupal

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:14,209
agencies and you want to team up and

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:16,399
make a merger or maybe you're a handful

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:19,369
of Drupal agency that just want to group

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,350
together to have a global presence I'm

00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:22,639
you know this is a great opportunity to

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,050
keep that in mind and so that's what

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,050
people see it

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,450
another goal that people like to sponsor

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,170
for is for talent recruitment and talent

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:36,339
strengthening you know the Drupal

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:39,470
community is a very very educated smart

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:43,180
intuitive community and it's rare to

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,140
come by this this high level of talent

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,660
specifically specifically within

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,209
Drupal's so you know what better place

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,130
to recruit talent than a day Jubal Khan

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,720
or maybe you're just trying to

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,930
strengthen your team already you know

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,149
prove to your team that um you know

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,390
prove to your team that you are invested

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,070
in the Drupal probably know you are

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,380
invested in Drupal and you're willing to

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,720
invest and give back which keeps them

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,660
you know happy keep some salmon around

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,820
or maybe you're trying to you know

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:18,740
develop their their skills the next part

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:21,800
the next goal that we that we see here

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,660
I'd Rubicon it's just you know to

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,440
demonstrate your community and thought

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:31,930
leadership within the existing Drupal

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:35,240
community or within the Drupal economy

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,740
so I kind of want to break down each one

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,740
of these goals a little bit again I

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:43,190
respect understanding no so just to make

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:46,190
it short so if you are if your goal is

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:50,270
new business or business acquisition

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:52,310
it's important that you know if you are

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:55,940
a Drupal agency you're really pushing

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,600
Drupal there's going to be a thousands

00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:02,149
of people that are drupal experts here

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,089
that can essentially all do the same

00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:07,310
thing or that know about it so your goal

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:10,430
if you are reaching a site or an owner

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:13,339
it's to really push Drupal and then you

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,770
go into what separates you from the rest

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:19,579
little shops or why your services are

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:22,699
there you know Drupal is ultimately

00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:25,370
competing against other CMS's and the

00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:28,100
site owners and the CTOs they need to

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,750
make these decisions and they are there

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,940
to learn about Drupal they're not there

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:37,820
to learn about you that comes after the

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,860
fact and if your software and if you

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,650
have a software that integrates with

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,680
Drupal or your hosting company that

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,900
supports a Drupal platform you know talk

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,350
about why you decided to integrate with

00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,540
Drupal and how it helps you know push

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,050
the Drupal experience so if you are

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,270
after you know these Drupal shop owners

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,160
or agencies and you know that your

00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,670
product or your software can really

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,890
expand on Drupal you know again keep it

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:10,940
your messaging tailored around Drupal X

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:14,270
and itself I fear there's to develop if

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,860
your goal is to develop business you

00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,640
know this means you've already had this

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,860
existing relationship and if you if

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,530
they're your client already you know

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,600
even better but if you're trying to push

00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,120
them down this pipeline this is your

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,790
opportunity to really be their triple

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,790
ambassador no invite them in show them

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,820
around introduce them to key few years

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,500
within the community take them to your

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,770
if you have a sessions or if you have

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,450
trainings or if you're a part of boss

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:47,390
birds of feathers take them there and

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,690
just demonstrate that you are committed

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:54,770
to Drupal and that you are a influencer

00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:57,710
this can be key so don't hesitate or

00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,890
don't be scared to bring it in your

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,020
clients or bring into your pipeline if

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,140
you do just be prepared to show them

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,790
around you don't need a base hit but you

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,850
know sometimes it's nice to have you

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,560
know be with him be by the side but you

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,050
know show them around show them what

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,310
Drupal is all about because so many

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:20,810
people change their complete aspect or

00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:23,959
mindset on Drupal when they just see the

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:27,380
community in action it can be a great

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,880
beautiful thing so don't hesitate if

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,760
your goal is to just network in

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,770
partnership or and to see what

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,500
partnership opportunities there are out

work for you representing your brand by

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,340
wearing your shirt show that they're

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:37,700
having a good time that could be the

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,470
best tool of all because a developer is

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,320
going to know a good developer when they

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,179
see them and so train your team train

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,860
your staff okay if you're for your

00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:47,690
hiring let them know that you're hiring

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,660
so they can be out there actively

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,669
recruiting themselves and if you're

00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,230
there to just strengthen your team make

00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:57,470
sure it's both professional and personal

00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:00,020
development we offer trainings and a lot

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:04,260
of these trainings are high quality

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:05,520
stuff you know let them attend

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,800
these trainings these are all going to

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,920
be happening on monday so this is going

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,770
to make you as a company better if they

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,170
become a better developer but this is

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,360
also time for just developing their

00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,760
personal or you know personal

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,180
development this is fun this is a

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,300
community-driven event invite them have

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,330
them you know you know let everyone have

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:34,980
a good time no don't stress them out too

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:37,260
much you know build their excitement and

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,230
show that you are invested in them and

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,110
you're invested in Drupal I can't stress

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,020
enough how important it is just if you

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:49,080
as a company show that you're invested

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,940
people will become invested in their

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,340
personal well-being and invested in

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,100
Drupal know people will start coming to

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,080
you so I can't stress that enough and if

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,450
you're here to just demonstrate your

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,920
community and thought leadership it's

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,720
important that you're in part of the

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:09,660
conversation so you're attending boss

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:13,260
you are attending sessions you're

00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:16,110
attending sprint you know you're there

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,150
because you're committed and you know

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,220
you're not afraid just harder to show

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:23,220
that off don't just be in the background

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:26,100
listening you know join in join in on

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,000
the conversation and if you're you know

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,050
you don't have to necessarily be be a

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,140
existing later if you're just now

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:36,750
joining in or if you have a team that is

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,730
new to the Drupal environment learn how

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,130
you can get involved and you can't

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,990
really get involved without sort of

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,520
pushing your boundaries and you know

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,320
attending these events and these

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:55,110
separate things happen around drupalcon

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:58,230
you know explore me people learn this is

00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,450
a great great educational opportunity so

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,210
if you're not an existing leader learn

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,100
how to be and if you are a leader and if

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,500
you think you have you know the right

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,960
inside or join in on the conversation

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,730
and provide your input everyone's going

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,770
to be appreciative of what you have to

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,800
share and the experiences that you've

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,800
had

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,960
alright so the next step to success is

00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:27,290
to define your message similar to define

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,170
your goal this is something that you

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,320
want to have set in place before you

00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:36,950
come and the first point is just know

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,710
who you want to talk to you know who

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,830
your target is you know why you're there

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,230
sponsoring but it's important that your

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,720
whole team again you everyone knows who

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,510
you are you want to talk to there's

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,010
going to be a different set of people

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,900
here there's going to be developers

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,919
there's going to be business owners

00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:00,890
there's going to be site owners agencies

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,919
so just nail down who you want to talk

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,870
to and then start understanding who you

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,730
are talking to so I like to say you know

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,380
an open source community is a sharing

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,270
community because just like any other

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,820
open source project it's built off

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,919
individuals sharing their knowledge

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,919
sharing their code or just sharing their

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,929
case studies to help people you know

00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,600
better themselves into better the

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:33,110
project so when you're talking to

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,390
someone you know come from respective of

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,270
what you can share with them whether

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,360
it's you know you have a software that

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:45,080
integrates with Drupal and it's going to

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:49,250
make this project more efficient or if

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:52,940
you are a Drupal shop or an agency share

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,860
case studies you know come from it from

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,520
that perspective you know this is what

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,270
we've done you know let us help you let

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,730
us share our experiences with you and

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:07,610
you know if you're not sure of what they

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,799
are after you know just ask or ask us we

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,380
have a pretty good understanding of the

00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:16,299
Drupal community or ask the people or

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:19,010
ask the community themselves by you know

00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:21,650
messing around on drupal org or just

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:25,160
talking to developers are talking to

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:27,860
site owners or talking to drupal shop

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,500
owners I'm just having a grasping the

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,320
understanding really help you be able to

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,650
take

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,120
your message and so once you know who

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,670
you're talking our who you want to talk

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:43,080
to and sort of who you're talking to and

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:44,400
learn what they want to hear again

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,770
there's going to be different types of

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,290
people here at attending triple con I

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:52,380
kind of broke it down to developers

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,720
agency customers again a it extends way

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,210
beyond that but you know developers are

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,560
here attending drupalcon because they

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,250
want to know what's new they want to

00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:05,160
know the new technologies out there that

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,490
are going to extend Drupal that are

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,440
going to push Drupal to the next level

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,420
and you know they're going to want to

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,610
know what's out there that's going to

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,680
make them better at Drupal or better at

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,780
using Drupal so they're going to looking

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,390
for educational experiences or

00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,840
educational opportunities so if you can

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:27,120
provide those you know share it and make

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,760
them come to you and the last thing is

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,260
you know why should I will work if

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,390
you're looking to hire you know why

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,910
should I work for you there's hundreds

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,310
and hundreds of companies out there

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,990
there's hundreds and hundreds of

00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:42,630
agencies that extend beyond rupal out

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:45,420
there so one what's your company culture

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:48,890
all about what do you have to offer me

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,300
and then why should I invest in a Drupal

00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,790
agency or Wi-Fi invest and working in

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,700
Drupal so you know understand what they

00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,620
want to know and so if you are a Drupal

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:03,000
if you're looking to talk to Drupal

00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:05,280
agencies you're talking to these these

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,410
agencies that work with and drupal and

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,480
you're an isv company or sorry if you're

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,670
a company that has software that

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,320
integrates or extensible if you're a

00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:19,290
hosting platform that is catered towards

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,030
the Drupal environment you know they

00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:24,600
want to know how you can help move them

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:26,550
up the stack they're there to work in

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,280
drool because that's what they do and

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:33,360
they want to offer their customers their

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,970
clients the best Drupal or the build the

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,760
best website that they can for them so

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,000
you as an oft where integrator or a

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,800
hosting company is to help them move up

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,010
their stacks so they can invest all

00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,530
their times Andrey

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:50,140
sources and their developers into doing

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:53,410
what they do best and into doing what

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:56,500
they do originally came to do that's to

00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,900
build amazing websites so look at it

00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,390
from that perspective and if you are the

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,480
Drupal agencies or you are a Drupal shop

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,430
that you know builds websites again talk

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,830
about and you you want to work to these

00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,470
customers we call them customers these

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,520
are the site owners the people that

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,400
ultimately have their sights build

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,340
operable you're there to talk about why

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,130
Drupal first and foremost you know what

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,680
separates Drupal from the rest they came

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,330
to juba con to learn about Drupal or you

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,020
invited them to come to learn about

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:31,690
Drupal the show your presence in Drupal

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,360
and why you are invested so you'll make

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:37,240
that clear and then you go on to why you

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,940
you know why your agency what do you do

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,590
better than everyone else and you to

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,230
sort of see you know prove your

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:48,100
credibility so this can be you know hey

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:50,920
we're you know this can be based off of

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,740
case studies know we've done this we can

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,450
prove it but I'd then again you've

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,270
already taken the first steps it's

00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,790
credible you as a sponsor have a step

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,440
above beyond anyone else who's attending

00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,530
that is not sponsoring because it shows

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,650
that one you're thriving too you're

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:11,440
invested and you know that Drupal is

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,490
going to be the right product for you or

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:19,150
for your customers and then you can show

00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,890
like you're the people themselves that

00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,570
are going to be building your website so

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,450
this is going to be your developers or

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:29,470
your team that are going to be in charge

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:32,050
of that so one why Drupal and then to

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:35,110
why you what separates you whether it's

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,210
what you've done in the past what you're

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,870
doing now or you the workforce you have

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,640
on him and then the next thing about

00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:45,460
defining your message is just to

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,080
determine how you'll get the get them to

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:52,000
hear you so this can be you know are you

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,310
going to be talking to them do you want

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,380
to you know just get your brand out

00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,380
there to make it risk recognizable

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:05,409
do you want to you know get them to hear

00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:08,590
you by showing your influence and say

00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:10,899
within Drupal community or your presence

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,629
at the sprint whatever it is you know

00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:16,480
determine which medium or platform

00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:18,220
you're going to use to get these people

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,649
to hear you because again no one wants

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:24,070
to just be simply pitch to they're here

00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:26,769
for a different reason so you know have

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:30,220
that laid out and stick with it again

00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:34,570
you know certain benefits might arise

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,809
that you didn't see but that's only a

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:39,340
benefit from there on out so determine

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:44,230
you know what your best practices are

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:47,710
going to be so the next step to success

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,299
is to really be proactive I'm going to

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:53,440
try to break this down into before

00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:57,279
during and after I personally think this

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,600
is one of the more important aspects

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,669
when it comes to sponsoring because

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,950
again like I said drupalcon is a

00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:06,309
platform we're providing you know people

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:08,379
are gathering it's here we provided the

00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,419
tool so now really what are you going to

00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:13,389
do about it you know how are you going

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,570
to maximize it yourself you have your

00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:18,909
team you have your marketing goals you

00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,970
have your sales team so it's very

00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:24,070
important to be proactive so before the

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,109
conference event starts again you want

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,389
to set your goals and messaging we've

00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:30,759
already covered that you want to prepare

00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:33,700
your team make sure your team knows what

00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:36,369
your goals are and make sure they know

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,309
what your messaging is because remember

00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:41,350
you won't always be around you're either

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:42,909
going to be manning your booth you're

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,419
going to be attending a session your

00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:49,179
cells and so it's important that one you

00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:50,679
bring your team a little tip free as

00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,499
many people as you can because more

00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,330
people you have the better chance you

00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:58,269
have to expand your presence within

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,519
drupalcon because again it does extend

00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:03,460
beyond the show for or beyond legs of

00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,980
the hall forum so just prepare your team

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:10,559
make sure everyone's on the same page

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:12,629
and if you are there to reach

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,230
uh you know site owners or if you're

00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:19,100
there to reach businesses drupal shops

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:21,570
or drupal agencies if you're there to

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,990
network and partner with other people

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:29,190
you know reach out to them find them we

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:31,980
have tools we have the community page on

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:36,749
the event website we can see who came if

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:39,149
you are a you know certain level of a

00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:43,169
sponsor you received an attendee list

00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:44,999
with the names of people attending so

00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,850
reach out to them and if you don't see

00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:50,490
anyone that you want to talk to or if

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,860
you don't see any really prospective

00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,710
client bring them in and bite them to

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,279
drupalcon we provided you with codes for

00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:01,769
you to send out that gives them to you

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,460
no discount we've sent you over free

00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:08,419
tickets for you to just bring anyone

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:12,450
else you want to or you can just simply

00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:17,789
you know be their chauffeur and you know

00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:21,600
take them on from 41 nothing's better

00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:24,179
than to have your audience they are

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,480
waiting for you rather than having to

00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:30,690
find them while you're at drupa con so

00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,649
set meetings with these people you know

00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:36,960
tell them to stop on by your booth and

00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:38,940
invite them to outings explore the town

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,679
but it's also important that you are

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,629
accessible because maybe there's people

00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,019
out there trying to do the same thing to

00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:48,539
you maybe you are the potential partner

00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,639
or maybe you are the company that

00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,129
someone wants to work for so again be

00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:56,159
accessible while you registered you have

00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:58,679
the chance to you know put yourself

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,480
public on the TV page I recommend doing

00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,159
so because if someone wants to reach out

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,030
to you it's important that you're able

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,190
to be found again

00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,590
I can touch on this but set up beatings

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,590
or set up these social outings if you

00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,930
want to have a meeting sit down meeting

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,660
our conversation with a prospective

00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:20,540
client or an existing client or client

00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,450
that is in the pipeline right now you

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,550
know make sure there's time to sit down

00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:29,150
and have the conversation that you need

00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,770
because a touch on it Rubicon is big

00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:32,890
it's exciting there's a lot of things

00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:36,200
happening so it's important to sort of

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:38,180
have this time set aside or maybe you

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,680
just want to have a social outing just

00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,570
to sort of you know wine down get to you

00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,640
know build a relationships with your

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,350
with your clients or to build a

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,660
relationship with people that you

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,550
potentially could see yourself parting

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:56,960
with you know New Orleans is a great

00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:59,510
city take advantage of it so do all that

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,340
stuff beforehand and then have a plan in

00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:04,640
mind and how you're going to follow up

00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,630
before you show up there's classic you

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,150
know you always want to have your

00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,620
business cards in mind so one you can

00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,690
follow up with them or two they can

00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,540
follow up with you if you're going to be

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:17,120
emailing people have your email set in

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:22,669
place before you go or have your

00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:26,630
messaging set in place are you know the

00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:27,919
sort of a template is set because again

00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:32,570
there's going to be a lot of things

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,550
happening and things might change and to

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:39,110
stay consistent it's just nice to have

00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:41,140
these messages made before your things

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,190
even begin so you don't lose track that

00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,590
and if you're going to be tracking leads

00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:48,140
you know there's lead scanners you can

00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:50,030
order we'll get into more detail to that

00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,770
so you know order that beforehand

00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,630
there's a lot of tools on how you're

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,220
going to follow up it's important that

00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,610
you and your team know how you're going

00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,610
to do it

00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:11,660
so so the ways to be take advantage of

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,170
or sorry to be proactive during the

00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,880
event there's a couple different there's

00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:19,490
a couple different things here that I

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,880
like to talk about so this is where

00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:26,510
we're where we really this is really

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,250
where we begin to get into Drupal

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,190
specific or to book on specific

00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:33,470
activities so this is where I'd like to

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,570
highlight a few things so you're going

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,860
to be proactive at rubicon it's

00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,140
important that you take advantage of

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,720
everything that jus pecan has to offer

00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:46,880
because again this is a platform for you

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:49,910
to really build off of take advantage of

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,020
yes you can do the minimum and you may

00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:56,330
not be happy but you know it's your

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,220
option so I'm just here to let you know

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:00,140
that this stuff exists so the first

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,690
thing i want to touch on is they exhibit

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,450
a home so if you're a core sponsor and

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,400
you have a booth this is where it's

00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,310
going to be this is where lunch is going

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,020
to be all the sponsors are going to be

00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:17,900
exhibiting coffee breaks fun activities

00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:19,580
wherever it is so I want to start with

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,990
your booth there's going to be a lot of

00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:28,190
booths out there we do provide you know

00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:31,460
a table a couple of chairs some

00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:33,740
tablecloths and whatnot but it's really

00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,350
an empty slate for you to build off of

00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:39,560
if you want people to come to your booth

00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:41,810
you know make them come or I invite them

00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,830
to come you have Freeman services

00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:47,150
Freeman you can order a whole the

00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:50,180
furniture you want you can really

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,920
decorate your booth stand out you can

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,170
ship anything that you need through

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,130
Freeman so look through their exhibitors

00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,690
services kit and see what's out there

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,960
you know what are you going to do to

00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:07,120
stand out or what are you going to do to

00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,120
drive people to your try to your boot

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,410
you know if you are sitting there with a

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:16,250
banner and just two people sitting at

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:19,310
their tables with the laptop you know

00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,960
that aren't really engaging with traffic

00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,870
and they're kind of getting bored you

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,540
know the effort you put in is the the

00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:28,310
output you should expect so you have

00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,610
these tools and if you really just want

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:34,490
people to come not necessarily too

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,020
concerned with coming because they want

00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,730
to see your product you'll think about

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,080
ordering some catering everyone's going

00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,110
to be hungry everyone's going to be

00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,000
thirsty you have the option you have a

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,590
full catering menu at hand so if you

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,360
look through the Fremen exhibitor

00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,130
services kit there's going to be a

00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,420
section for catering the carrion is

00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,820
going to be done through the convention

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,420
center there's literally a full menu

00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:59,360
where you can get beverages alcoholic

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,970
and non-alcoholic from beers to

00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,640
cocktails to whatever it is that you

00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:07,220
need you have this option and a great

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,350
way to stand out you know serve

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,720
something that you know serve a couple

00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:14,330
snacks on a Wednesday later in the day

00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,710
when people are hungry and they don't

00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:18,440
have any more lunch but they got to make

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:21,500
to the next session and they got to be

00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,870
engaged they knew that energy and if you

00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,620
want to Clive leads every badge is going

00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:31,040
to have a every badge is going to have a

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:34,190
QR code or a bar code on the back you

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,440
have the option to order a lead scanner

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:39,140
through American trade show they'll be

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,750
there on site helping you you know to

00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,540
really maximize what this scanning

00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,580
capabilities do but if you're worried

00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,960
about forgetting people's names not

00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,740
being able to follow up think about

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,450
ordering that pre ham then you also have

00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,960
pro AV who are going to be our audio and

00:38:53,450 --> 00:39:00,320
video service providers again this can

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,740
all be found in Freeman's kit but if you

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,590
want to show your product off nothing's

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,990
better than to demo demo it it's one

00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:14,570
thing to just talk about it it's another

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:17,050
thing to prove it in to you know show

00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:20,000
its full capabilities by doing it on

00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,650
hand so you can order monitors you can

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,029
order all the audio video

00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,240
it meant that you need or again you can

00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:28,190
bring this in you can ship it but if you

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,150
want people to come to your booth stand

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:34,130
out another part I'd like to mention is

00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,799
so during the exhibit hall there's going

00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,869
to be breaks in which sets and traffic

00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:43,369
is going to or sorry traffic is going to

00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:45,799
be a little bit larger than the rest of

00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:49,490
the day so be prepared so during coffee

00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:50,900
which is a 10-15 a.m. each day after the

00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,789
keynote there's going to be a large

00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,250
coffee break or a longer coffee break

00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:57,700
you can expect a lot of people to be

00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:02,809
attending so make sure your booth is a

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:05,240
man so nothing's worse than you know

00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:07,460
missing an opportunity because you don't

00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,910
have the capacity so if you have other

00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:13,309
people attending event developers

00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:16,400
project manner managers that are really

00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:19,069
just there to you know I see the rest of

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,599
the activities going on have them help

00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:22,789
you out during these breaks because this

00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:24,049
when you're need it lunch which is going

00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:25,490
to be happening in at noon every day

00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:28,250
it's going to be another big one this

00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:30,319
mean hour long break where people are

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,849
going to be one obviously they're going

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,410
to eating but the food's going to be

00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:35,450
served in the exhibit hall there's a lot

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,529
of people coming around and once they're

00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,260
done they're going to want to learn from

00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:41,000
you so be prepared and then in between

00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,130
each session there's going to be about a

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,349
15 minute break these are other times

00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,760
when you you know just want to make sure

00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:52,670
you're at full capacity and ready to go

00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,279
eat beforehand or eat after lunch get

00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,660
your coffee before get your copy after

00:40:54,279 --> 00:41:02,809
either way you know you don't want to

00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:04,490
miss out on this traffic the last x.x

00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:07,069
aspect i want to mention about the

00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:12,920
exhibit hall so when these brakes aren't

00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:15,770
going on or you know traffic seems to

00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:19,480
slow down take advantage of the fact

00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:22,430
that there are you know about a 80

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,520
quality companies out there that you can

00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:27,349
network with you know this is your time

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,619
to walk around the exhibit hall meet

00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:33,410
these companies that you had prepared to

00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:35,900
meet before you came you know talk with

00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:38,539
them there's literally have been mergers

00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:43,670
have started on the exhibit hall four of

00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:45,710
these of these drupal cons so again look

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,440
at the droop or look at the sponsor list

00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,839
on the website see who's coming scout

00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,940
them out and you know this is your time

00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:55,099
to network and have conversations them

00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,980
and if you're looking for a quiet spot

00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:00,289
to have a conversation new this year we

00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,299
created a little lounge for you guys to

00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:05,660
have these conversations in it's only

00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:08,089
for sponsors it's going to be on the

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,069
perimeter of the exhibit hall floor it's

00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:12,730
going to be places sit down you know

00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:16,849
light refreshments bring them in there

00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:18,529
you know this is your chance to network

00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:21,049
and have these conversations without

00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:24,589
being too far from your setup so the

00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:28,630
exhibit hall is you know an event in its

00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:31,849
own so take full advantage of it please

00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:34,549
so taking full advantage advantage in

00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:36,740
programming so again drupalcon is a

00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:40,099
little very large things there's a lot

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:44,359
of things happening programming is

00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:48,579
essentially the things that are we've

00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:53,450
curated as the drupal association that

00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:56,690
you can go to learn to talk or to just

00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:58,010
generally progress the drupal project so

00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,380
i'm going to break these down real quick

00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,289
so we have summits these are all going

00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,480
to be happening on monday may nine

00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:08,930
majority of them start at 9am some of

00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,839
them start at 1130am if you want further

00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,250
detail if you want to sign up for them

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,829
one thing i have to point out higher ed

00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,349
summit has sold out you know you have

00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:17,910
the option

00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:22,499
buy tickets to these so the business

00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:24,809
summit is going to be for these drupal

00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:29,269
shop or drupal shop our Drupal agency

00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:31,829
leaders that are you know already

00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:35,549
invested in Drupal and they're there to

00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:39,680
discuss the Drupal business ecosystem

00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:41,700
and how it's running and to share

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,589
experiences with someone so if you're

00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,599
not heavily involved with Drupal this

00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:47,460
may not be the place for you to go

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,539
because as I've touched on a couple

00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:54,239
times this is open community and people

00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:56,160
are there to share experiences and share

00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,890
their knowledge so if you don't have

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,599
experiences to sort of contribute to

00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:05,700
this conversation it may not be the best

00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:09,119
one but if you um if you are you know a

00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:13,769
high-level exact type manager type you

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,410
know that are one invested in Drupal or

00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:18,930
want to be invested in Drupal or two you

00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:21,930
own a shop at in this this could be the

00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:24,239
great time for you to see what other

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,969
people are experiencing learn from their

00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:31,140
experiences and really just talk about

00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:33,749
the future of Drupal the higher ed

00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,670
summit the media publishing summit and

00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:38,369
the government summit are designed for

00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:41,309
people working within these industries

00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:42,869
so these are going to be universities is

00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:45,359
going to be media companies or

00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:50,160
government agencies that are looking to

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:53,999
explore new CMS is or if you are a shop

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,420
or a software company that are our that

00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:59,670
is already highly involved in either of

00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:03,150
these three sectors meaning you have

00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:05,430
past experiences for you to you know to

00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:08,729
share yourselves or to contribute to the

00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:11,009
conversation you can attend these in

00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:13,200
view come up you know be a common part

00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:15,029
of the programming they do breakout

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,579
sessions where literally it's just

00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:21,049
conversations being had this is an

00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:24,809
opportunity to be in a room with people

00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:27,299
and have a designated time to have these

00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:28,890
conversations that you know can't

00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,850
normally have because you're off running

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,780
a business or

00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:37,370
or mainly Jean elsewhere this is not the

00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:41,010
time to go in and to start selling to

00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:42,420
the people that are attending knees so

00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:45,990
if you are a Drupal shop and you're

00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:49,410
looking to you know get some media

00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:51,660
clients this is not the place for you if

00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:55,680
you are a and I a software integrated

00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:58,050
company and you're trying to reach you

00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,280
know agency owners the business summit

00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,470
is probably not going to be the place

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,200
for you we do have a business code of

00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,540
conduct and if you do attendees in this

00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,000
in people start recognize it you may be

00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,910
actually asked to leave but if you are

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,280
there actively contributing and being a

00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:17,400
part of the conversation as I touched on

00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,260
earlier this is could be an event all it

00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,500
sells so if you haven't already look at

00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,030
the tickets again higher it's sold out

00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,820
but that's something going on on Monday

00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:28,230
the next thing i want to touch on is

00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,900
trainings trainings are also going to be

00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:34,360
happening on monday and if you're there

00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:38,740
to just you know for

00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:40,450
developing your team or to you know this

00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,950
could be towed touch both the

00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,810
professional and personal development

00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:47,740
side because one it shows that you're

00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:51,400
willing to invest in them to make them

00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:53,020
better as a professional but I also kind

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,270
of touches on the personal side because

00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:58,030
you know these people are developers

00:46:55,270 --> 00:47:00,100
really do enjoy what they are doing but

00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:02,860
there's something for everyone too it's

00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,390
not just coding language being talked on

00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,860
there there's project managers tracks

00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:11,620
and if you're in a software company

00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:13,570
there's a whole training on building

00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,670
modules for Drupal 8 so if you're

00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:17,890
looking at how to integrate better with

00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:21,490
Drupal you know maybe you think about

00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:25,330
sending some of your software developers

00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:27,730
or developers Drupal developers to this

00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:31,330
to these trainings so it's going to

00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:35,560
better you as a company when your team

00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:38,200
is armed with this knowledge so the next

00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,510
two things are happening monday tuesday

00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,820
are sorry tuesday wednesday thursday of

00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:46,450
the conference so may 10th 11th and 12th

00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:50,530
this is the sort of programming that's

00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:53,740
happening for the pave aspect sort of

00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,990
thing so monday you don't need to pawn

00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,850
paso tin so you can attend just training

00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:01,180
or just a summit and not attend the trip

00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:03,220
run the full four days but if you want

00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,530
to attend boxing session you do need the

00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,590
full pass so if you're not familiar with

00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:10,980
what a boss is re birds of feather it's

00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,450
sort of like a summit where it's just

00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,970
inorganic conversations there's going to

00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:19,120
be no one really leaving this but you do

00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,590
have the option to submit a topic so if

00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,750
you're really passionate about a topic

00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:25,390
and you want to make sure it's discussed

00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:28,300
while you're at do become go on to the

00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:33,070
events website go into the boss section

00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:37,000
and find in open time slot to submit

00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:38,140
this topic there are a few left so you

00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,050
know the opportunities there are

00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:43,030
penciling but there's also chances for

00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,560
you to just see what other people have

00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,860
submitted if you see something that you

00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,860
are

00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:52,050
you know passionate about or you want to

00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,060
just network with people that also feel

00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,270
the same way you know this is a great

00:48:54,060 --> 00:49:00,870
very very good organic networking

00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:04,260
opportunity that is going to be revolved

00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:05,880
around a specific topic you know

00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,380
everyone knows the general networking

00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,490
hey let's go have a dinner that's got a

00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:14,060
meeting this is a great way to network

00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:19,350
through thought leadership and through

00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:20,910
you know goals and missions i guess as

00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:23,910
best things i say for lack of better

00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,740
terms so look to attend these and make

00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:28,050
sure if you are at your booth make sure

00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,900
people within your company are attending

00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:35,660
for you and representing you the next

00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:41,580
thing is sessions sessions are lead

00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:42,420
educational opportunities this is not

00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,190
going to be a chance to have a

00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,840
conversation because it really is

00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:49,530
presentation but if you want to learn

00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,440
about Drupal say you are an software

00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:53,690
company or hosting company and you want

00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,390
to learn what Drupal is all about

00:49:53,690 --> 00:50:00,270
attendees in if you don't if anything

00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:01,800
you come away knowing how to you know

00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,300
knowing the Drupal community or the

00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,070
Drupal ecosystem even more here are a

00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,440
tuple agency or you offer jus baza

00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:13,740
services obviously this is your chance

00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,140
to learn how to Drupal better or to use

00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,880
Drupal better if your have a developer

00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,280
if your developer or you're sending the

00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,500
development team this is a chance for

00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,150
them to better their skills if you're a

00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,130
business owner there's business tracks

00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:28,530
this is a chance for you to learn how to

00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:30,060
become a better business owners so again

00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:33,030
take full advantage of all the

00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:37,770
programming happening around drupalcon

00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:39,450
because you know it's beyond extends

00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:43,380
beyond your booth or beyond your

00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:45,540
sponsorship so there is a lot of going

00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:49,110
on and i know you can't be all places at

00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:50,910
once but it's important to try to elise

00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:52,680
attend some so again do your research

00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:55,050
beforehand see what you want to do and

00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:58,220
bring a large team so if you can't make

00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,220
it someone else can

00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:03,009
so there's also a lot of events

00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:05,979
happening around drupalcon surrounding

00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:08,200
drupalcon that aren't going to

00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,400
necessarily be programming so the first

00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,989
thing i want to touch on is the first

00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,190
time attending social this is going to

00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:16,930
be happening on monday at four pm so

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,489
this is during the same day the

00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:20,769
trainings and the summits are taking on

00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:22,930

00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,400
new to drupal or if you're new to triple

00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,630
con or if you're sending a bunch of

00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,809
developers that are just new to

00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:31,509

there's no other programming going on or

00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,140

me an off-site event I mean the title

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,119

00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:05,670
next thing i want to touch on is kind of

00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:09,240
my bread and butter is the sponsor

00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:11,010
appreciation VIP happy hour reception so

00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,370

00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:21,150
four five thirty this is if you're a

00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:24,660
sponsor you got a set amount of

00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:29,100
invitations that you can have for this

00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:32,580
event I always recommend sending your

00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:35,760
executives or your managers because this

00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:39,950
is a cream lacrosse networking activity

00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,420
this is where all the influencers and

00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,970
community leaders and business shop

00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:48,660
owners are going to be just have a

00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:51,690
chance to relax rewind its social as me

00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:53,550
free drinks free food and it's gonna be

00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:56,310
happening right there at the convention

00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,740
center so you don't have to go far and

00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:01,650
it's just great time to wind down and

00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,690
you know have some social conversations

00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,300
and build relationships with people meet

00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:09,660
people that you've never known so if you

00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:12,690
haven't rsvp'd your VIPs please do so

00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:16,470
you can do that on the sponsor event kit

00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:18,630
i sent you and then there's meetups

00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:21,120
parties in trivia night so these are

00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,130
just things that have been arranged by

00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,220
the trivia night was arranged by us but

00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:28,680
the meetups and parties and such such

00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:31,260
are arranged by the community we have

00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,090
promoted so we go to the social events

00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:36,840
page you can see a list of what's

00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:38,580
happening because so much okey i could

00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,130
almost argue that most of the business

00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,620
is done outside of drupalcon itself

00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:47,460
because rubicon is there for learning

00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,720
for education for showcasing what you're

00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,410
doing not a chance to have these

00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:56,280
conversations so attendees events or put

00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:59,460
on your own events nothing says that you

00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,620
don't you can't do it yourself I put on

00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,720
a dinner invite everyone it doesn't have

00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,910
to be public or you can make it public

00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,800
you can throw a huge party and you know

00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:10,080
invite the whole world and everyone can

00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:14,150
see how great your brand is but you know

00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,150
these are where your real

00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,420
networking opportunities are going to

00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,070
lie so please attend them because a lot

00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,869
of the beautiful most of the drupalcon

00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:25,560
attendees will be attending them as well

00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:26,910
so it can make for organic networking or

00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,300
you can just set something up like I

00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:33,510
mentioned and you know cater or curate

00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,810
the networking events I love trivia

00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:39,210
night probably not the best networking

00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:42,800
as far as business goes but on Thursday

00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:45,690
we put on trivia night it's super fun

00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,430
and if you actually do have a client or

00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:49,410
a prospective client that wants to know

00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,990
what the Drupal community is all about

00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:56,160
you know invite them there because so

00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:59,550
many times people come to Drupal cons

00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,590
and once they see the community at work

00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,119
and really what the community is all

00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:07,230
about that's when they make their

00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:09,030
decision to go with Drupal so again that

00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,800
takes a lot of prep work if you want to

00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,600
bring in clients or bring them out but

00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,160
just show off the community you don't

00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,550
necessarily just have to show off how

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,500
great Drupal is as a tool but you know

00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:22,740
show off the community and this is a

00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,720
great chance to do so the last but not

00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,940
least you know take full advantage of

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,040
New Orleans it's you know we don't just

00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:32,609
pick these cities you know out of that

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,590
hat there's a reason we chose New

00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:39,450
Orleans there's a lot to offer it has a

00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:42,000
lot to offer so you know take a night on

00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:46,250
the town or come a little bit earlier

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,109
stay a little bit later and meet people

00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:51,210
invite people to dinners two lunches you

00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:52,650
know start reserving your rooms because

00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:54,630
I already know people are start

00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,190
reserving your ear restaurants your

00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,590
dinner reservations because i know

00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,810
people already are doing that so see

00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:03,090
what's going on check out yelp for good

00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:06,090
reviews see what's you know you can ask

00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:08,310
us we have some places in mind but take

00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:10,530
full advantage of New Orleans because as

00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:12,810
much as jus pecan is happening there's

00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:15,670
also this huge city for you to just

00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:17,410
conduct your business and

00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:20,470
I kind of want to end with some

00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:22,690
networking 101 most of you probably know

00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,549
this but this is something that you

00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:27,069
should sort of just relay to your team

00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:29,109
won bring plenty of business cards

00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:31,349
there's gonna be a lot of people you're

00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:33,730
going to meet tons and tons of people

00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:36,160
experience it a lot so make sure that

00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,900
one people can remember you by having a

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,079
business card and to you grab their

00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:43,450
business card so you can remind them

00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,470
prepare a little elevator pitch again

00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:49,900
you're going to be meeting a lot of

00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:54,069
people so it's nice chance to make an

00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:56,760
impression you know we have a set up so

00:57:54,069 --> 00:58:00,220
you could literally run into the

00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,960
elevator situation because we have the

00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,299
set of hotels where majority of the

00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,030
hotel are triple continues are going to

00:58:04,299 --> 00:58:08,740
be attending so if you do happen to be

00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:10,869
in elevator make sure you're prepared or

00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,910
if you're at a trivia a night when you

00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:15,309
only have about 10 seconds talk make

00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:19,240
sure they prepare or you know inform

00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:20,650
your team on what the messaging is going

00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:24,130
to be so they can give these little

00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:26,710
pitches and avoid gravitating to people

00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:28,720
to know that you know again this is a

00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:30,520
community-driven advantage so this is a

00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,040
time for the to need to finally get

00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:36,460
together after talking so long I googled

00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:39,010
org and you know fixing all these issues

00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:42,309
and making the project better it's your

00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:43,839
chance to really meet new people so

00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:47,079
please don't gravitate to people that

00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:50,099
you know you know try simple if you're

00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:53,470
shy or if you have a team that shy no

00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:55,809
invite them to just be pretty bling

00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:59,670
because no one's going to oppose it you

00:58:55,809 --> 00:59:02,260
know hey I ever met you my name is blink

00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:03,910
find people that are by themselves pair

00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,859
up the friend because you never know who

00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:08,950
you're going to meet you don't know who

00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:10,900
is who they do have attending badge but

00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:13,390
you're not going to see their job title

00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:16,180
from across away some you know Scout the

00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:18,460
mountain you know I can't tell you know

00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,540
if don't sell anything rather just this

00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:23,200
is your chance to build relationships

00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,510
and then later on you know when the time

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,740
arises that may be your chance you know

00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:31,810
find out more about them again this is

00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,490
an open source community you know what

00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:35,050
can you learn about them what can you do

00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:37,360
for them tell them about yourself about

00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:40,390
your company learn about them and learn

00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:42,070
about their company and if someone's

00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:44,380
given you a car if you're made you know

00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:47,470
meeting someone take notes take down

00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,670
their numbers and so you can be personal

00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:50,980
because no one likes to just get an

00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:54,790
email blast it's almost offensive to

00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:57,369
just bag high we can so and so we met

00:59:54,790 --> 01:00:00,510
and you just tell to mail merge so be

00:59:57,369 --> 01:00:04,210
personal be personal and be personable

01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:06,730
it can go a long way so you may already

01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:10,840
know this but educate your team before

01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:14,500
they come quick recap of what we covered

01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:16,869
so these are the step 6 success so

01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:19,150
understand Drupal understand the

01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:21,730
community and understand drupalcon do

01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:24,600
your research understand who you're

01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:27,940
talking to and who you want to talk to

01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:29,230
define your goals before you come make

01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,869
sure they're measurable make sure

01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:34,450
there's you have an opportunity to come

01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:36,490
back and when you are done you know

01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:39,460
wrapping up all your follow-up emails

01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:41,859
whatever it may be that you can look

01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:44,410
down and you can see yes we achieved it

01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:47,290
no we didn't achieve it define your

01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:48,940
message know who you want to talk to

01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:52,119
know how you're going to talk to them

01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:53,560
and make sure that you're consistent

01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:56,830
with your message make sure your team

01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:59,230
knows to be consistent if you're

01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:02,410
bringing a team make sure they're proud

01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,150
you know dress in my opinion uniform my

01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:07,210
brain and sure it can go a long way if

01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:09,700
you have people sprinting and they're

01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:12,280
sprinting if they're at the Sprint's

01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,740
wearing your shirt that right there is

01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:18,040
in a marketing tool is showing that your

01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:20,410
company is contributing back to the cup

01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,930
or coming back to the project and be

01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:24,970
proactive there's a lot of things a lot

01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:27,190
of steps that you need to do before

01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:29,619
during and after whether it's you know
