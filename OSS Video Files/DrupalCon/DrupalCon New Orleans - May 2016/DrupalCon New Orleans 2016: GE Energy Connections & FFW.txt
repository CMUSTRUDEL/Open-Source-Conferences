	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
so there I was sitting in my office

00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,170
dreading that phone call that I was

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,179
going to have to have with the customer

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,880
giving them horrible information that I

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,580
didn't want to have to give it was 2007

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,760
and the organization that I was with at

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,039
the time was was using many different

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,250
kinds of content management platforms we

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,570
had a custom system that we had built

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,510
we'd engaged with a customer who is a

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,910
start-up and they were building an

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,430
online community for music where artists

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,760
could upload music to their their own

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,190
music to the site and they get people

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,960
could purchase products they're artists

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,610
products purchase the artist music

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,260
upload tablature there's going to be a

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,860
large online community that would

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,010
compete with last.fm and we've gone

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,890
through a discovery process and we had

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,170
identified who all the users were we had

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,420
done branding we'd spent about four and

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,219
a half four or five months going through

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,059
a pretty stringent discovery we had

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,519
created wireframes for the project and I

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,229
found out after about a week and a half

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,880
or two weeks of development that the

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,350
systems that we were trying to integrate

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,880
together to get all of this to work

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,320
we're going to be able to speak to each

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,820
other that completely different

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,740
structures they had completely different

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,900
kind of database structures on the back

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,920
end and it was it was really a mess and

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,630
instead of picking up the phone I

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,479
started speaking of my boss and he had

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,829
been down at South by and he mentioned

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,470
that he had heard of this content

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,770
management system called Drupal or

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,979
Drupal or Drupal and it was supposedly

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,990
this very innovative solution that was

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,490
very flexible and he said why don't you

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,430
go check that out and I'm not a

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,159
technical person at all and so he had

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,860
installed it for me basically taught me

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,420
how to upload new modules and so I was

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,540
off and running within a week and a half

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,259
we started looking at what I built with

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,549
treating some content types with

00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:03,960
checking out different user permissions

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,270
and I about a week and a half gotten

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,550
farther along with in developing

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,840
developing the site than a team of our

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,069
developers I've lived

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,500
guys working on the project at the time

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:16,349
had gotten in a matter of four weeks and

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,709
so at that point I think for us was a

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,110
pivotal moment not only in my career but

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,690
for that organization six months later

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,090
we had the project completed on time it

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,830
was within budget the customer was very

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,030
happy that they had a solution that gave

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,000
them more power than they thought that

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,489
they were going to have and six months

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,239
after that our company had completely

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:42,030
changed our business model to really

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,239
revolve around drew we've moved to

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,769
becoming a very lean organization

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,980
implementing agile processes we change

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,329
the way that we sell projects we change

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,110
our project management approach

00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:56,519
obviously moving away from waterfall and

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,900
it was a transition point for that

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,599
organization I think that you'll hear

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,910
that story is probably very common

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,120
throughout the Drupal community and a

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,680
lot of the successful agencies and how

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,170
they got into Drupal and how they've

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,930
been able to shift their business model

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,200
because of Drupal my name is Brent vice

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,120
I now work with ffw and I'm joined

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,340
joining me today is holly valance she is

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,829
the digital strategy leader for GE

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,690
energy connections she has a very

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,019
similar story and I want you two guys to

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,819
hear her story today of how GE got into

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,030
Drupal and what it's meant for her

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,760
business so we're going to be discussing

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:39,690
by delivering business results beyond

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,669
your typical clicks and conversions I'm

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,430
sure everyone here show of hands if

00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,590
you've heard of GE before most likely

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,260
you have it and so I'd like to tell you

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,480
a little bit about ffw if you don't mind

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,239
we're an organization that is is built

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,989
on technology driven by data and focused

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,660
on user experience we have 250 Drupal

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,720
developers 75 of which are aqua is

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,299
certified making us the largest Drupal

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,590
agency on the planet and I don't think

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,569
the bigger is better i think that better

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,790
is better and i honestly believe that

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,310
we're in many ways both without

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,989
offending anyone in the room and and

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,019
i'll tell you why i think that that we

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,409
look at measurable results and

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,100
everything that we do I think we're very

00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,440
transparent

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,260
and very disciplined and very lean team

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,180
and more than anything I think that we

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,770
hire the right people for our

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,940
organization because in our business

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:38,280
people are our greatest asset and above

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,710
and beyond that we always put our

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,410
customers focus from the top down coming

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,930
from the CEO that we put our customers

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,690
and our customers needs and helping them

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,050
reach their goals beyond everything that

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,240
we do in today's world companies that

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,040
want to get ahead and stay ahead have to

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,990
put their customer at the center of all

00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,940
of their thinking making sure that all

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,350
products and services that seamlessly

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,510
into customer desires and behaviors and

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,550
to me that requires really an outside

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,790
and approach to how you run your

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,200
business starting with and understanding

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,630
what your customers needs are and

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,610
staying laser focused on that and moving

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,040
that back through the chain from cells

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:24,990
to marketing to customer service working

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,490
in as one team driven around helping

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,560
your customers achieve their goal rather

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,250
than working in silos like so many

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,780
businesses do and so it's a it's a bit

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,520
of a different approach that I think

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,460
more successful companies are starting

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,990
to take and when you really put your

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,790
customer first and think about your

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,490
customer first and think about their

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,160
needs first you benefit from that you

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,170
gain customers more easily you gain them

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,890
faster you retain customers for longer

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:57,960
you drive more revenue for your business

00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,580
which all of those things in turn create

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,290
efficiencies if you think about a freer

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,390
company because your sales team doesn't

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,130
have to work as hard to sell things your

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,260
marketing team doesn't necessarily have

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,680
to work as hard to market because you're

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,090
keeping these customers around and I

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,240
think for these reasons and putting our

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,100
customers first we're trusted by many of

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,700
the world's largest organizations most

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,170
well-known brands to help him not only

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,180
implement tools to reach a broader

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,640
audience to increase conversion to sell

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,920
more products but were focused on

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,290
helping them achieve internal

00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,240
empowerment for their business so that

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,100
their marketers can do their jobs by

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,050
more easily creating a generating

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,370
content for their customers and giving

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,120
their customers the things that they

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,380
want we help create efficiencies by not

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,030
only looking at the front end of web

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,500
sites but looking how Drupal on the

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,220
backend can be a better user experience

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:55,660
and how we can make it more simple for

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,940
groups to work together by approving

00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,920
internal communication by helping to

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,250
reduce as much as possible project risk

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,470
and so always focusing not only on those

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,180
clicks and conversions of focusing on

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,720
creating internal efficiencies for the

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,850
clients that we work with and what we're

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,770
finding is that you know successes and

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,740
always about clicks and conversions yes

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:21,160
it's mostly about revenue but looking at

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,720
ways to leverage technology outside of

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,610
just flexing new versions especially

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,530
geared around websites because Drupal is

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,140
so much more than just a web content

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,180
management solution helping to improve

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,940
administrative processes or delivering

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,430
more ROI and that's a big big work today

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,010
in today's business more and more we're

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,950
seeing that CMOS and CIOs or having to

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,330
not only you know buy new products and

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,730
building products but do more with less

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,500
that's huge in the university's base

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,480
when I'm when I'm talking to higher

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,580
education sometimes these guys are

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,010
having to maintain a support you know

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,840
more than 150 websites with a team of

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,970
less than five people and that can be

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,100
very challenging in today's world and

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,530
they can't get the budgets that they

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,170
need and so looking for ways that that

00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,620
Drupal or really any of any technology

00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:12,010
can help them do their jobs faster do

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,750
their jobs better and we're also seeing

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,460
that that people are starting to kind of

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,770
look outside of the box and not

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,960
necessarily thinking of Drupal as a web

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,490
content management platform we're

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,860
finding that people are building content

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,490
repositories perhaps if you're a pharma

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,430
company and you're looking at Oh PDP

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,500
regulations for example creating content

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,920
repositories or workflows are ways to

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,710
help to help bring insights to that so

00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,800
that you can stay in touch with with

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,620
regulatory compliance we're seeing

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,510
people build learning

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,360
management system systems for their

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:50,470
internal sales teams to teach you to

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,550
drive for for education we're finding

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,710
even more groups that are using it

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,980
obviously as intranets we're seeing

00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,170
drupal used as back in 444 headless

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,430
applications or native applications so

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,190
it's being used in a lot of different

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,080
ways we're also seeing the people

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,610
Earthlings you are really simplifying

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,930
their platform management I think this

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,060
is something that Holly will be sticking

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,880
to quite a bit with her journey through

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,430
Drupal imagine if you will a large

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,210
organization universities I continue to

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,010
go back to them because they have this

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,170
challenge all the time see it in every

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,420
University that I've spoken with and

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,970
work with is that they work in silos

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,529
they're not working as one team they're

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,339
broken up into sit basically separate

00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,900
business units and they'll have various

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:39,339
different technologies on the back end

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:42,860
whether it's running dotnet or PHP

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:44,810
Drupal wordpress site poor they have all

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,520
of these different systems now imagine

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,130
the efficiencies that you could perhaps

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,620
get if you work together and decided

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,270
upon one platform bring it in one

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,950
solution and then either through

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,320
multi-site or through distributions

00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,290
however you set that up you can then

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,600
only focus on managing that one

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,310
application that one platform the

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,390
efficiencies that your business gains

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:11,020
from that obviously you have a reduction

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,160
of systems and platforms which also

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,990
reduces the number of vendors that you

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,430
have to communicate with on a daily

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:22,070
basis contract negotiation and paperwork

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,330
and significantly be reduced these

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,010
aren't things that people generally

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,080
think of when they're creating KPIs

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,990
around websites but there are things

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,430
that are very important to your business

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,350
you can you can improve your internal

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,880
training programs and documentation and

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,170
stove have instead of having to be

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,270
experts at four or five different

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,440
systems and having to do training with

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,680
your team around these four or five

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,410
disparate systems you can train on one

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,200
system and then of course leveraging

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:51,410
tools across your business units to

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,120
create more efficiencies perhaps if if

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,630
you have one group that needs a certain

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,030
feature

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,740
then they can build that feature out of

00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,990
their budget and that feature could be

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,870
distributed to the other groups within

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,460
the organization or they collectively

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,080
pull their money to create certain

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,070
features that they need it creates

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,050
efficiency at reduced cost etc so don't

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,820
take my word for today again i'm going

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,770
to introduce Holly you guys have good

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,470
for a big round of applause and I want

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:21,260
her to tell her story about GE energy

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:29,300
connections and their transition into to

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:33,440
lean and what Drupal's myth hey good

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,510
afternoon everybody so my name is holly

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,730
bounds I work for what is called GE

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,440
energy connections formerly it was GE

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:43,460
energy management for that I was GE

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,100
Energy G is has been known to acquire a

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,200
company here and there over you know

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,880
it's many years of business and so over

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,530
a period of time with all these

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,510
acquisitions that also meant that we

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,240
acquired a great many content management

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,640
systems and hosting platforms and when I

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,590
say hosting platform I really mean it

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,650
was a server under somebody's desk that

00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:05,150
they also used as a footrest we also

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,880
have a lot of ERP systems we have

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,530
several ecommerce systems several

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:16,840
marketing automation system so we had

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:22,670
quite the inventory of platforms so what

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:26,060
started this was that in 2012 GE Energy

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,290
I've decided that it was too large and

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,360
that we were going to break into three

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:32,690
businesses GE oil and gas G power and

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,720
water and GE energy connections each of

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:38,750
us would now report up to our investors

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,760
and what that means is our revenue would

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,530
be reported separately to our investors

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,900
the investors want to be able to go

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,660
somewhere and see what they've invested

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,000
in so we had to build a site right

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,980
because we'd all been one site now we

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,730
needed to build three sites or in my

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,100
case six sites and then eventually 40

00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,950
sites but anyway listen

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,200
that's the way things work so the vision

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:07,000
though as I inherited all of these

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:08,680
disparate systems and and one thing I

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,090
will share with you so as we had the

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,030
conversation we asked the pole in the

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,920
room who's devel to developer who's IT

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,900
my degrees in english i have a

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,520
specialization in british literature and

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,740
i have a so specialization in

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,710
shakespeare that qualifies me to teach

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:27,010
or get married and I've done neither of

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:29,620
those so imagine what it's like when

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,050
I've gone from producing content for a

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,760
website to building a website and

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,830
deciding how to host a website and

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,170
what's the content management system I

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,060
just type stuff in and it pops up on the

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,580
screen I don't really know so it was

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,580
quite it was quite a different journey

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:48,190
to go to the other side so to speak and

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,780
and learned the back end and make the

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,110
decision on how we were going to build

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:55,270
out so because i don't have an IT or

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,880
technical background really i looked at

00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,940
the vision for where did we want to be

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,530
really focused around as Brent said what

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:08,200
is my customer want I sell really big

00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:10,420
not really pretty electrical equipment

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,450
and you're not probably going to see it

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,390
most of the time it's in the the Kia

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,150
Motors plant or the Budweiser bottling

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,770
facility or a big substation that's down

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,510
in your neighborhood and you think

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,400
anything is an eyesore that's dropping

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,230
my property value that's all my stuff

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,800
and I find it beautiful it's a lovely

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,960
shade of an see number 63 anyway what is

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,360
my customer want what do they need for

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,860
me how do they get how do they want to

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,650
get information so that they make them

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,930
they can make a buying decision that's

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,360
what's important to me it's unfortunate

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,120
in the program that they said delivering

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,920
business results beyond revenue that was

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,200
a typo because you will learn very

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,000
quickly Meghan Trainor's all about that

00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,900
bass Holly bounds is all about that

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,120
revenue I very much believe that we all

00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,760
every one of us exists to sell product

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,580
if we don't we go out of business we get

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,860
a pink slip and we go home so for me

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,980
it's how do I make it a better user

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,570
experience

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,850
experience for my end customer so we

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,730
wanted to be able to build yes an

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,130
attractive website of course it's GE and

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,930
we have a brand to maintain we also

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,730
wanted to be a wanted our customers to

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,170
be able to search and find exactly what

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,079
they needed to find in the fewest number

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:31,490
of clicks that's not new we wanted them

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:33,500
to be to get information at all stages

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,540
of the buyer journey from that very

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,160
early beginnings when they're doing an

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,010
investigation of do I even have a

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,800
problem do I want to do anything about

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:46,160
that problem to evaluating a short

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,779
listing customer suppliers we wanted

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,180
them to have that information that they

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,410
need and that approximately seventy

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,750
percent of the buyer journey that

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,570
happens online before they ever talk to

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,480
a sales person so we wanted we wanted

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:02,540
our user experience to be the most that

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,019
was the center focus for us on how to me

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,420
forward we also knew that a website is

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:11,089
static it's it's it's like flypaper

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,250
you've got to drive people there it's

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,410
like you built a house and then didn't

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,720
give anybody the address nobody is ever

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,339
going to come visit you so you put out

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,680
you send out your open house invitation

00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:23,870
right so we wanted we also were looking

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,360
at our outbound promotion how do we

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,970
drive traffic onto our website so that

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,680
wasn't that was very important to us we

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,230
wanted to know who is coming to our

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,730
website and conversely who's not coming

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,250
to our website because that's just as

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,500
important to us we have very key

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,449
segments and key accounts and we wanted

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,670
to be able to serve those customers very

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,190
specifically we also divided our

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,720
audiences into personas and we develop

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,240
content this particular to those

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,870
personas so those were all of the the

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,690
key pieces that were in our vision of

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:59,240
what to build the experience to build we

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,370
started there not the technology we've

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,110
figured out what we needed it to be for

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,250
our and customer and then build

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,339
backwards from the

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,199
so this is the starting point and we

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,970
started like I said with GE energy we

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,220
broke into three companies that meant

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,559
that my business GE energy management

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:23,829
became GE energy connections needed its

00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:26,350
own website we had we had a company

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:28,360
called GE power conversion it used to be

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,190
called kamar team it was it was an

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,020
acquisition they were in the process of

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,690
being merged into the GE energy website

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,299
when GE energy went away so they needed

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,830
a website that need to be migrated from

00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:42,490
I don't even know content management

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,410
system have no idea we had another group

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,270
called energy consulting they were

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,790
integrated into the energy website so

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,130
now they needed their own website and we

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,370
had GE industrial solutions that had

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,870
their own website roughly 32 different

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,210
websites those are the ones that were

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,549
under people's desks they all needed to

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,220
be migrated in the midst of all of this

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,230
we acquired another company and they

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,260
became part of the fold they were in yet

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,600
another platform and then we had one

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,390
more site that has not yet migrated the

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:17,530
Drupal it's in a hunger and see if CMS

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:20,410
so it was it was it was a spider web of

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,640
different systems honestly I couldn't

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,530
even tell you all the content management

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,290
systems we had I really don't know what

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:29,020
they were and I don't care because that

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,299
wasn't the end goal for me the value is

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,950
the value is the content I provide to

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:37,240
the customer not what's running in the

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:39,790
back end in amongst all of our how r

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,370
visioning of what we wanted to do we had

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,530
a cross business team from our different

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,020
business units are different pls and we

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,030
had then decide what do you want to do

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,640
would fit so now that we know what we

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,440
want it to be what technology do you

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,240
want to use so they went through the

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,130
process this is before I was ever hired

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,710
and decided that they wanted to go with

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,220
open source and then from there they

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,200
decided between joomla and drupal and

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,510
they chose drupal and that's the point

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,549
that i picked up the program and it was

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,309
up to me to put out the RFP find a

00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,070
vendor and start the build process I was

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:18,390
introduced to Aqua by

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:21,540
decisions and from working with aquia we

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,340
used them as our systems architects they

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,710
introduced us to you what was known as

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,910
blink reaction at the time this has been

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:34,560
acquired the theme and there that's ffw

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:37,500
agency now in talking to aquia they said

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,010
by the way gcom the corporate site is

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,960
being deployed in Drupal next month like

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,150
really we had no idea we thought were

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,940
the only ones so that we immediately

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:50,700
created our own little two-person

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:54,690
community within GE to share information

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:58,080
on purple and so that's how our journey

00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:01,290
began with Drupal and over time started

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:05,040
the integration process one thing that

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:07,770
really helped me a lot was our CEO Jeff

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,990
Immelt began simplification that was

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,870
that's an initiative within GE is

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,840
simplification and you can do a lot when

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,430
you term something as a simplification

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,650
project and this truly was

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:22,230
simplification because it eliminated a

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,760
lot of difference as as Brent alluded a

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,770
lot of different content management

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,860
systems a lot of which were proprietary

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:31,590
which involves cost and a lot of time

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,230
negotiating contracts and managing

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,210
licenses and that's that can take up a

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,490
lot of time that you should otherwise be

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,980
spending creating content for your end

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,670
customer I'm same thing with hosting it

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,370
was we wish to eliminate just a lot of

00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:49,470
useless effort by consolidating to a

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,810
single content management system and a

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,700
single hosting platform and that allows

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:59,670
us to focus on our end customers like I

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,550
said one of the things that that was was

00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:04,110
really important to us as we walked

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,750
worked our way through this and made a

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:11,100
decision made some major decisions was

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:15,330
who owns the web at that time aighty

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,790
owned the web I team so as long as it

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:21,639
was stable and nobody hacked it it was

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:23,649
good okay but i'm not selling websites

00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,919
right i'm selling beautiful power

00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:28,799
equipment so we made the decision

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,169
internally that we were going to change

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,139
ownership to marketing and really not

00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:36,909
just marketing its marketing sales

00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:40,359
communications and IT we have we have

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,979
the four horses of the apocalypse that

00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,409
own the web and the web experience

00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:46,479
because communications uses it to

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,029
communicate our messaging our brand

00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:52,749
message our product message to investors

00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:55,389
to to talent that that might be

00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:57,969
interested in coming to work for GE to

00:21:55,389 --> 00:22:00,549
students to you who are working on their

00:21:57,969 --> 00:22:02,259
dissertation to the folks that we want

00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,579
to buy our products so community is

00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,279
important to communications is it

00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:08,589
important to sales we are driving a lot

00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,539
of our a lot of our revenue through

00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:11,829
e-commerce these days and then of course

00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:14,589
the marketing wanting to introduce

00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:18,999
product so it really was important for

00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:20,889
us to share the ownership of this of our

00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:24,579
web and web property so that was a very

00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:27,820
big change for us and one that took some

00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:30,339
some time and some consideration another

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,070
big piece was making the decision to

00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:35,739
host externally with oo keliya now it

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:39,429
seemed now at GE everybody's moving to

00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:42,099
AWS but at the time I moved nobody was

00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,759
hosting outside GE data centers the big

00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:47,609
concern was that we would get hacked

00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:51,190
okay and they get my brochure where I

00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:53,950
want them to have that I don't care so

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,769
that was that was a lot of discussion

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,109
that went around that but when we went

00:22:56,769 --> 00:23:01,450
through the process and we had some

00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:03,909
really great IT team teammates who

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,589
worked with us said you know we've done

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:07,659
we've done their due diligence on aqua

00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:10,029
and your platform is perfectly safe

00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:13,539
we're not worried and by the way they're

00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:15,159
more cost effective than we are okay

00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:17,109
I've got your blessing so that was that

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,969
was a turning point and again if for

00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:21,639
four years later it seems like nothing

00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:23,459
but at the time it was I mean you can't

00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:26,190
imagine how many hours we spent

00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:28,100
deliberating these things but in the end

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:31,460
that's what we've done we

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,970
we've consolidated on Drupal and we host

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:38,840
with aquia so this is the timeline of

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:41,630
how this all occurred so I like i said i

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:46,570
started in 2012 in october october 17th

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:48,950
and very quickly moved in this project

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,440
one of the things that's so incredibly

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,900
special about today is that I got to

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,190
meet the developers who built all these

00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,640
sites we've been working together since

00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:01,190
november of 2012 and we've never met so

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,440
that is if that doesn't show you how a

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,260
virtual team can work well together I

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,080
can't imagine I can't imagine a better

00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,630
example so Maria and dentists are here

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,830
from fw again never never met them

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,500
before today so I'm so incredibly

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,760
excited to share this now what I would

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,980
say it would be very interesting if

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,450
Maria cave stood up here and we all had

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,700
a cocktail and she shared her side of

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,890
the story I'm sure it'd be very

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,809
different what it was like to work with

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,150
the English major to build these

00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,250
websites but this is how we how we built

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,780
hours out we worked with aqua from the

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,250
very beginning to do our system

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,020
architecture so they helped us from the

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,409
beginning and they introduced the staff

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:42,710
ffw and they built our first sight we

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:46,490
went with a different vendor for our

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:50,000
second sight we went with a little local

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,350
agency and when we moved to our third

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,440
went to build our third side which is a

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:58,669
migration maria and team discovered that

00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:01,820
they had there were issues with the code

00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:03,370
that made multi-site not work so they

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,960
invested a great amount of time

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,970
rectifying that problem because when

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,190
i'll show you in a minute what our site

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,530
structure looks like but we are we're

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,240
multi-site within multi-site I heard a

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,470
presentation earlier today when someone

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,510
said they paced heard of multi-site

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,400
who's heard of positive and negatives

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,460
multi-site and everybody kind of groaned

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,280
I love it it is the greatest thing ever

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:28,789
I think is the most fabulous thing ever

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:31,100
and I'm a strong proponent when we built

00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:35,620
all of these sites out our leadership

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:38,270
had at that time our mandate was every

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,779
business units website has to be

00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,179
portable

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:44,899
as we're looking to sell off or move

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,679
around the business each of these

00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:48,479
company these are each of these

00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,669
divisions so we were acting as a holding

00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:52,129
company so that was the mandate each one

00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,019
has to be able to take their site their

00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:57,659
folder and move it somewhere else so

00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,029
that was a consideration from from day

00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:01,529
one and that will limit you but that's

00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:03,119
that's what we had to work with and so

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:04,979
far like I said multi-site with the

00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,519
multi-site have been perfect for us and

00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:10,139
we're at the point now where we have the

00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,509
majority of our sites built out

00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:15,539
including country sites for one of our

00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:17,399
pianos that are in local language we

00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,989
have one more major site to migrate from

00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,139
there cut their home burn content

00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:23,969
management system but it's been it's

00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:27,869
been all positive for us we've we've

00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:30,149
gone back to you ffw for the majority of

00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:32,549
our sites one side is built by a company

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:35,399
out of San Diego they continue to work

00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,889
with us and where they push their code

00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:39,479
to ffw and Marie and her team tested

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:44,460
across all of our sites and then push it

00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:47,849
a live on Thursday so for us at least in

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:50,039
my opinion it's a pretty good story that

00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:52,080
we can run this many sites multi-site

00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:55,349
within multi-site on a single doc rate

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,950
which apologies to aquia but it saves me

00:26:55,349 --> 00:27:00,629
a ton of money in in hosting costs and

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,779
like I said I'm all about the revenue

00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:05,429
and if we went at separate dockery for

00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,460
every site that's a lot of money and I

00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:09,989
don't I don't sell websites my company

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,739
customers don't buy them so therefore

00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:15,299
it's not a it's just a cost for me so

00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:17,129
for us being able to have multiple

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,649
vendors if our panels will really want

00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:22,619
to work with different developers we can

00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:25,919
do that it works beautifully for us also

00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:29,249
because we can push content or sorry

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,820
push code site-wide code changes it

00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:36,210
allows us to very quickly with GE we

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,309
protect our brand very very carefully

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,529
and so keeping all of our sites within a

00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:42,389
template a template I they have they

00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:44,009
each look a little bit different but in

00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:46,529
general when you look at it it's a GE

00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:48,389
site you will you will know as a GE site

00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:48,750
and this way using multi site with a

00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:50,760
multi

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,220
we can keep everybody within that GE

00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,400
look and feel so it's been very very

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,500
positive for us so this is current state

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,870
this is all of our different websites

00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,880
that Maria and team of build out for us

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,490
what you'll notice a lot of them are

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,980
country specific sites that's important

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,670
because that beautiful equipment that i

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,440
told you about some of that is can only

00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:16,710
be used in north america some of it can

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,950
only be used in europe some comfort some

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,600
companies in Europe own utilities in the

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,450
u.s. they need to be able to buy both

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,540
IEC rated products and I Triple E

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:29,850
products so they're each of these sites

00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,760
has content that is very specific to the

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,020
region where that equipment is useful so

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,880
that's why we've had to build up these

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:41,550
country specific sites it's not just

00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,680
language it's the content as well so the

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,870
these are our results won't read them

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,550
all to you I'll tell use it that read

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,410
that that cost savings number is very

00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,960
low I'm not going to tell you exactly

00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:56,640
what it is I don't commit any of that to

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:59,430
paper or photo that's that was for 11

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,550
P&L alone and there's six of us so I

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:04,110
mean you can imagine what what we've

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,020
been able to achieve for our business

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,670
and cost savings that source hosting

00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,710
like that says twenty two percent less

00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,460
expensive to go with Drupal I mean go

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,690
with Acquia then to host it internally I

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,560
one thing that I've loved develop the

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:21,210
having aquia host is it's not my problem

00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:26,760
knuckle SCP someone else's problem when

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:28,890
Hartley bug hit not my problem just fix

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,490
it and I cannot tell you how wonderful

00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:36,600
that was to not be on the hook for

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:39,510
figuring that out and then my last again

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,270
business reason for doing this is its I

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:44,280
would tell you to focus on value I mean

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,110
if you're a developer IT person whatever

00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,030
and you're looking to partner with

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,590
marketing and communications if you're

00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,960
marketing communication sales looking to

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,940
partner with IT focus on where you add

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,400
value where does your not just you but

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,380
your company where do you add value to

00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,389
your in customer for me I don't add

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,579
value to an electric utility

00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:07,989
by hosting my own website or developing

00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:10,269
content I mean I are sorry developing a

00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:11,950
website that's not my value so we're

00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:16,359
outsourcing all those things where we

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:17,979
don't specifically add value so we have

00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,450
a few things that are still works we

00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:22,209
have a few more sites to get live in

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,739
Drupal I'm we're looking to roll out a

00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:27,669
pilot that we did with a company called

00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:30,489
Bay note and they do dynamic product

00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:33,820
recommendations they've done we've seen

00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:37,269
excellent work I'm from them ffw helped

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:39,070
us build out the the interface that the

00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,049
product catalog that was running in the

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,389
background for them so still needed

00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:46,059
developers to help us with that the idea

00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:47,619
behind that is instead of your product

00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,509
people putting together product

00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:50,859
recommendations that are static they put

00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:52,479
them together and maybe don't look at

00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:54,729
that page again for another year these

00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:57,849
recommendations are based on actual

00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:59,859
people's search habits on your site so

00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:01,329
someone has looked at page a page B and

00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,429
the page see the next person looks at

00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:07,209
page a and page be going to serve a page

00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:09,609
see as a recommendation our results on

00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:11,259
that pilot we saw a five hundred and

00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:13,929
twenty-seven percent increase on click

00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:15,759
throughs based on versus the ones that

00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:18,459
my product managers did not to knock my

00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,919
product managers but what my next goal

00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,739
was is I wanted to see from there how

00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,259
many people click through to our online

00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:28,059
portal to buy or they clicked on where

00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,219
to buy which led them to a distributor

00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:32,739
my results were an eighteen hundred

00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:34,149
percent increase in click throughs to

00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:35,919
either the online web part of the

00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:37,599
e-commerce portal or where to buy so

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,849
that's important to me because again

00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,559
it's about revenue so we look to roll

00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:44,769
that out and we're also working with

00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,019
another company called dim man base we

00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,969
use their software to see their their

00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:50,829
code to show us exactly what companies

00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:52,929
are coming to our sites and then we're

00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:54,489
building customized landing pages so

00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:58,089
that when someone comes from an IP

00:31:54,489 --> 00:32:00,519
address for Microsoft it'll show page

00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:01,659
that's customized for Microsoft we're

00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,329
doing the same thing there key

00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:06,669
industries so based on si si codes or

00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:08,950
naik's codes that demand based a text

00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:10,179
then we can serve up a page that has

00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,690
content the

00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:15,399
the specific to that industry and ffw

00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,850
created this templates for us as well

00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:20,740
and then our other big one is because we

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,960
have so many different sites just within

00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,840
energy connections and then with our

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,090
brethren over ng power and GU and gas

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,320
and GE digital and we're looking at

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,179
rolling out a google search appliance

00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,440
that will search across all of those

00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:34,840
sites so that you don't have to

00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,720
understand my org structure to be able

00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,029
to put together a multi-product solution

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,399
for your for your cover your product

00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:46,559
project so those are the few things that

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,559
we're working on for 2016

00:32:53,070 --> 00:33:05,170
like that easily yeah so thank you very

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:07,720
much Holly firfer for sharing and so I

00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:10,480
think at the end of the day I mean key

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,920
takeaways from from you know discussions

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,460
I've had with Holly and looking at her

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,690
presentation from from my background and

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,390
experience with projects that I've

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,190
worked on is is you know you really have

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,630
to keep a client first mentality and

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,450
everything that you do and shaking that

00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:29,670
again kind of bringing it from the top

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:32,560
and move the decisions that you make

00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:35,080
batteries I think can help you become

00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,640
more successful of course it says some

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:43,600
strategic initiatives and just you know

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:45,370
based on value and working in as if one

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,420
team rather than in silos i think is

00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:51,040
this hugely important for organizations

00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,720
and one of the things that I thought you

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,700
said it was very important I think it's

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,860
important regardless of the technology

00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,970
but but choosing the right partners to

00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,290
work with can be huge there are a lot of

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,910
agencies a lot of organizations out

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:09,370
there who say they can do certain things

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:12,160
who put PHP code into you know field

00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:14,140
hoping you up for perhaps a sequel

00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,330
injection or something like that and so

00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,400
make sure or or building your site in a

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,630
way that moves it out of multi-site so

00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,640
make sure that when you're when you're

00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,590
selecting partners on your team is

00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,510
implementing a project make sure that

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,010
you're doing it correctly so that you

00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,500
don't have to go back and do a lot of

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:33,010
rework and waste a lot of everyone's

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:36,250
time so what will keep it at that again

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,660
my name is Brent bodice work with ffw if

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,210
you guys have questions we'll open up

00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,280
the floor sure Holly is more than happy

00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,340
to answer any questions that you might

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,340

00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:04,200
great job putting it concisely give me

00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:06,330
an idea the timeline for you that was

00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,680
obviously in a price I cares a lot of

00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:15,180
decision-making from start to finish for

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:18,390
years so this team started the decision

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:31,349
so we broke up the company in October 10

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:34,640
2012 but we knew about it july so I

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:38,130
between July twentieth in October one

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,170
folks who are in place and you that they

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,349
had to do something so there was that

00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,349
time

00:35:49,820 --> 00:36:04,320
they've started we push our live really

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,500
we did a really quick corporate citing a

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:18,990
querer site in December 2012 so I

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:25,290
started 17 years jean-paul conversion

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:28,730
com live februari of 2013 why did the

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,730
site that I built over

00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:37,099
later when we started the migration of

00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:40,729
Jeannie guttural which ones are which

00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:45,529
was our largest seven or eight months

00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:48,979
though going fast somewhere in there we

00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:50,659
built GE energy that class are you GT

00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:53,899
energy consulting with that project only

00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:57,349
took us about two months that was pretty

00:36:53,899 --> 00:37:01,719
quickly shower so the majority of our

00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:01,719
sites were built between december

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:12,050
and then what we were working on Mallory

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,810
this country sites for GE industrials

00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:19,940
that's that second so those who have

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:23,990
taken longer because we have we have no

00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:26,480
developers just under our develop our

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:30,160
developers are only up ability because

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,600
Maria Dennis in there too that's it so

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,060
what we're working with is you'll have

00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,430
someone in the business is in terms of

00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:42,080
the content and an IT partner and that's

00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:43,820
it person Mac he was managing that who's

00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,830
the marketing person he's managing each

00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,070
of those sites don't know what two or

00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:51,110
three a time and then and she has an IT

00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,720
partner said they've been doing three at

00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:56,450
a time continuously I'm getting those

00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:00,590
sites live so I'm like I said I've one

00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:02,990
more big one to do and it should be it's

00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:06,950
very interactive has some really

00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:09,290
beautiful content on it and so I'm

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:12,260
looking forward to that one so we're not

00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:16,660
finished yet but it's definitely the

00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,660
biggest biggest Harry school

00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:27,000
yes you

00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:42,450
we have one more to go we've talked to

00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:44,490
them about Drupal 8 talk to Maria and

00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:49,500
routine should we move start moving

00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:52,140
everybody to AIDS or not the conv the

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,720
advice that they've given us is they've

00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,180
built everything for us in seven that we

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,220
need so we will eventually move date

00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,609
because you have to but right now we

00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:05,970
wouldn't gain anything by eight I've

00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:08,010
talked to the team for the one last site

00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,589
print solutions and said do you want to

00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,359
destroy the bait Okwe assures me that I

00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:14,579
can run seven and eight on the same

00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:17,569
doctorate do you want to go with eight

00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:19,950
we don't choose to be bleeding edge

00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:22,619
we're good to go with seven and then

00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:25,140
we'll all my great together and we'll

00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:27,810
all rode the same boat so that's that's

00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:31,520
our plan as it stands today good job

00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,520
Maria you've worked ass out of work

00:39:35,640 --> 00:40:01,960
there is exactly that's what I get so

00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,150
one of the things that I that I would

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,890
share with you is of all the sites that

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,200
you saw and I told you out in the never

00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:11,800
development to you I have a retainer

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:15,579
agreement between 430-5 hours per month

00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:18,160
so I have less than one person early

00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:23,319
less than a week of person to maintain

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:25,270
all these sites for us so I think happen

00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:27,400
something I think that's a testament or

00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:30,430
avoid I've been able to get my team to

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,530
get to consolidate and work together and

00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,950
share templates and all wasn't saying

00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:38,680
doctors and share code base so that we

00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:41,650
don't require Marie and her team has

00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,440
been so much time supporting so many

00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:48,030
different sites for us yes she worked

00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,030
herself out of bread

00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:53,289
that's again that's what was important

00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,529
to us as we wanted this to be we wanted

00:40:53,289 --> 00:41:00,599
to be able to focus all of our coats on

00:40:55,529 --> 00:41:04,119
updating content one of these two

00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:07,059
further there is so I just met writing

00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,369
82 we have content managers around the

00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:11,919
world all of our product managers

00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:15,279
product working managers are all turning

00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:17,679
to upload their own content they all

00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:20,289
have logins they all whatever climbs on

00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:23,799
our end when they have new information

00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:28,019
they post it themselves it does not go

00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:33,089
to read not come to me they're altering

00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:33,089
so that's really important to us

00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,779
comma and waited 24 hours and we checked

00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:43,459
online or commas in the wrong place to

00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,249
it back to work load three pages later

00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:47,839
have submitted in another tweet well

00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:49,759
there was no way I was going to deal

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,699
with that and so that's what we've done

00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:55,130
we truck these are GE employees we trust

00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:57,829
them to develop product we trust them to

00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:01,160
sell it to our customer which westin to

00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:02,509
install equipment thank you well thank

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,729
you so like something to move on a

00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:06,199
better metaphor so I cross them to get

00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:08,209
on my content management system and

00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:10,369
update their own product they know that

00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:11,989
content more than it better than anybody

00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:15,589
else and that's what we've done is

00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:17,719
really decentralized the content

00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:21,949
management process and that's that's

00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:23,299
been a huge huge state your us and again

00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:25,489
it goes back to our vision and making

00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:29,380
sure that we put our content in the

00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:29,380
hands of our customers so that they have

00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,720
that kind of goes back i think too that

00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,030
efficiency as well as working with one

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,770
platform rather than having to maintain

00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:41,609
and support perhaps seven different

00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,609
platforms

00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:05,920
sure Maria would you like to speak to

00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:07,510
that a little bit the good thing that

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,000
the Holy managed to do with this motor

00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,130
side is not just having a motor site but

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,070
having a consistency throughout of sites

00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:17,170
so and when she said more decide with a

00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,750
motor side a good example for that is

00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,280
the 40 almost 40 sides that maybe not

00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,600
all of them are white but almost 40

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,700
decided we have Forge industrial

00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,360
solutions they all have the same

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,040
functionality they have different

00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,050
content different languages but they all

00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,430
have the same functionality some of them

00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,260
are not using all of these

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,420
functionalities because they don't need

00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,840
them or they don't have content within

00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:44,080
the country but it's pretty consistent

00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,210
so whenever we have to apply a fixed new

00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,270
style new feature it gets applied

00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,910
automatically to all of them and and

00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:54,250
that's that's very useful because we

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,930
have this consistency we have a very

00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,730
good tool or regression testing that

00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,500
then is built which basically makes

00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,360
screenshots of every single page we're

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,550
talking about thousands of pages before

00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,320
we deploy something to production and

00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,750
compares it with the screen shows that

00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,690
were there before that and in our QA

00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:13,390
there is a comparison percentage our QA

00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,250
only reviews the pages that have some

00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:19,000
difference and we go in and see what was

00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:22,750
changed there if it's what we expected

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,640
to be changed or if it's just exchanged

00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,960
because you know at the same time we

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,750
often get pics changes done by the

00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,210
competitors because we don't even know

00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:33,610
how many content editors we have raided

00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,620
tray great training people keep training

00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:38,140
each other within the GE company and

00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,450
there are people around the group of 10

00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,260
dating content on

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,430
on the website so from that point we're

00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,260
pretty good at keeping things

00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:50,040
consistently and training people and

00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:52,410
helping the the content managers help

00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,740
each other they also have the ability to

00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:58,500
share content so in the last resolutions

00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:00,780
if you have a page for product or Canada

00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,580
that's in French the Friends of the

00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:06,390
France website can go in and pull

00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:08,730
content for that page updated for their

00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:11,760
own market and publish it immediately

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:14,010
sames for pictures they share contact

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,580
between different countries different

00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:19,950
languages makes some tweaks they got not

00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,140
they get notifications when that

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:25,380
original page got updated so they can

00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,420
update their own page if needed that's

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,420
pretty good synchronization model that

00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,980
with it which is moved away so it's not

00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,530
even one way it's multi way everyone can

00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,800
can share with everyone and everyone can

00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:41,210
can use content saves a lot of time for

00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,210
for the content managers

00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,830
pretty regulated deployment cycles as

00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,920
Holly said Thursday that's the day we

00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:10,750
chose for deployment everybody is aware

00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,880
one gets deployed when everybody's

00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,760
checking their websites ger supporting

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:24,340
us well with verifying changes both on

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:26,020
staging and production environments it's

00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,110
actually an internal script that that is

00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:31,990
built so it's not it's not the tool

00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:34,360
that's out there we just we the number

00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,850
of sites was growing so fast we had to

00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:39,460
find a way to do regression testing and

00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,410
it is always easy when you know what is

00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,210
out there and what you have to test but

00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,620
with the amount of pages that were being

00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:48,220
added all the time without us even

00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:50,380
knowing we couldn't keep track who are

00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:53,290
it what and you know what can what can

00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,780
break especially considering that some

00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:58,000
of the content editors were pretty good

00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,880
with putting in HTML in the what is

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,680
evacuated or making some fancy things so

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,900
we needed a to that will actually help

00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,150
us test something that we don't even

00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:12,300
know so then is it all of that custom

00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:14,770
scripts three years ago that help us I

00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,270
think they can be developed to intro to

00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:19,830
but right now there are just some rush

00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:22,560
comments that he runs and in our QA gets

00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:26,800
access to a folder where they can see in

00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,930
the comparison results and look into the

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,430
individual screenshot that have

00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:33,250
differences and the good thing is that

00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:35,710
this cipher is awesome so we need to

00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:39,369
screenshot not just desktop we need

00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:41,289
screenshots tablet mobile

00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:42,910
we need to consider all these break

00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:46,150
points because they're mostly content

00:47:42,910 --> 00:48:00,400
and it's important for us to support all

00:47:46,150 --> 00:48:03,160
those users mobile users question we

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,450
contribute a tremendous amount of code

00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:09,579
so possibly be good if perhaps vio would

00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:18,819
accept it who knows how their systems

00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:20,799
are we'll look into it I assume we will

00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:23,950
need to put in a little bit of time that

00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:27,509
we have to make it good enough for that

00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:27,509
work for the open source community

00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:11,710
well I think in all the states for

00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,160
example obviously she knew she was

00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:16,300
running various proprietary solutions I

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:21,420
think it came down at that point to a

00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:23,910
matter of the platform itself or

00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,829
where the Holly you know most important

00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:28,670
thing was that that she had specific

00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:30,839
goals in mind she went for her team

00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:36,260
needed a solution that he helped her

00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:36,260
achieve those goals and so focus on that

00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:50,790
I think it's fairly pretty common at

00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:53,000
no-brainer solution to the proprietary

00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,000
solutions

00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,850
of course you know because you can say

00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,470
well unless you're already attracting

00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,300
those guys saying this is what we're

00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,730
spending now and if I could talk to

00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,440
Holly and say hey Holly how exactly how

00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:14,080
much you spending now just so that I

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:18,340
know so that I can you know perhaps you

00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,860
can put together your discovery but

00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,900
usually outside your RFP process until

00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:29,770
you kind of gain a trust people aren't

00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:31,750
open up and say so I just have this one

00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,510
question did you know this decentralized

00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,370
solution is this something you knew you

00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,650
were going to do going in and you wanted

00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:41,320
to give this tall your employer's is

00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:51,580
something you evolved to recognize the

00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:53,650
value but there's a tougher question I

00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:56,410
may be an English major but I can do

00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,670
math when I saw we were spending on all

00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,990
these different content management

00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:03,420
systems and all these different those

00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:03,420
two platforms we again

00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:08,910
it was a no I say I've saved enough

00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:12,390
money that if it was mega millions he

00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:15,630
saw the billboard probably but it's

00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:20,599
pretty significant and again that's not

00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:24,720
value to my own customer no none of that

00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:26,550
was valuable to my customers they so

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,829
that was what was really important to me

00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:31,020
there's that they're just those causes

00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:33,150
licensing costs I mean that's a boss but

00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:36,359
there's a lot of time you start thinking

00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:40,140
about the amount of time that somebody

00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:42,210
spends entering content into a content

00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,940
management system or waiting an

00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:47,250
opportunity cost of waiting to update

00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,260
content and then customer doesn't see

00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,910
what they were looking for and they move

00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,760
on to my competitor I mean that's an

00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:55,980
even bigger cost that now I that I've

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,369
lost so that was really important to me

00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:03,420
I'm from my perspective I wanted to be

00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:05,760
economically attractive but I wanted the

00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,350
front end of the attractive it's really

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,680
important

00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:12,650
that my content managers see a front end

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,270
that's really easy whatever them is they

00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:16,580
have if they have five minutes between

00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,200
meetings I want them to say I've got

00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:21,020
five minutes I could go update that page

00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,910
not have five minutes there's no way

00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:26,480
we've got page updated I needed to be

00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:28,370
easy or they use it so that's what it's

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,390
something that's been really amazing

00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:34,460
about Drupal is everybody gets into it

00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:36,470
communications folks marketing folks the

00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:39,410
English major I get in here and then I

00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:42,260
can make changes myself that says so

00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:44,720
that was that's a longer term cost this

00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:49,940
a little harder to quantify but it makes

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,800
the biggest difference it's interesting

00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:55,790
because Drupal is not known necessarily

00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:57,140
as being an easy system to use I mean

00:52:55,790 --> 00:53:00,110
you've seen probably the diagrams of

00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,000
people jumping off cliffs you know in

00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:05,330
making updates and I think that a lot of

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,250
that kind of comes back to to making

00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:09,140
sure that the person is developing your

00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,850
side of agency this developing your site

00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,380
has a really good understanding of group

00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:14,720
will not only for just creating the

00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,940
website but for perhaps making

00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,370
recommendations on improving the

00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,170
administrative interface because there

00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:23,510
are a lot of ways that that you know you

00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:25,070
can change the theme around or a lot of

00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:27,740
different tools out there to make

00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:30,050
administering your website's easy as

00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,880
well it's not just about again making

00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,440
the front side of this front side of the

00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,620
site for your customer looking pretty

00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,780
making it easy but focusing also on

00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:40,460
making Drupal itself and the

00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,500
administrative experience for your users

00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:47,740
of good ones so that people will come in

00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,740
actually use the tools on a daily basis

00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,690
the natural solution site the one that

00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,850
has also always countryside we

00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:54,130
specifically get on to the design work

00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:57,370
for making it responsive and I can say

00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:59,350
that it's ninety percent responsive wife

00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:02,830
i'm ninety percent is because there are

00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:06,070
some pages that got migrated from the

00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:08,500
outside which are not getting a lot of

00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:10,360
traffic and it was decided that it's

00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,460
worth the effort to make them

00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:18,210
mobile-friendly like some calculators

00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:21,580
that were that coaches migrated as it is

00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:24,010
but the team for for industrial socials

00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:27,750
put so much effort into be doing ninety

00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,750
percent of the content just so it can

00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:49,690
so that part of the templates we do

00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:54,070
Heights angle which are not usable for

00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:55,720
mobile but i would say that older the

00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:58,300
templates and although they are designed

00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,520
in a way so that they work responsive

00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:02,200
and the block that gets hidden are the

00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:05,230
block that really don't have any value

00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,570
on mobile yes let's say if you have like

00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:12,520
some image map that you have to zoom in

00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:15,010
to see anything that gets yeah yeah that

00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,270
does get styled differently on mobile

00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:19,510
devices which is basically what

00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:25,300
responsive does they become list of

00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:26,800
links or some some skilled images or

00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,260
some drop downs or something else that

00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:35,340
will allow the user to use the content

00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:35,340
about boys or walks get reorders get

00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,290
they are doing a very good tool so one

00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:43,060
thing that's important here is that

00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:44,800
Drupal has the world of capabilities so

00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:47,050
if you give the end user all the

00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,810
capabilities they may get lost and they

00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:51,610
may end up with some without that not

00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:54,960
necessarily look perfect on all the

00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,960
devices and not older

00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:01,010
so we give them enough capability so

00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:03,290
they can do their pages within the

00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:06,470
templates but also make sure that we

00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:09,260
don't we don't give them too much so

00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:11,240
there's different types of user groups

00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:14,060
but the content managers they basically

00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:16,460
get a form people most of the time so

00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:19,010
it's as easy as filling in the form and

00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:22,820
go into different sales of waiting for

00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:24,500
reviewing then somebody else who gets

00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,200
more permissions can go in and publish

00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,120
it then there are users like holy who

00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,920
get to do final pages and the group

00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,770
walks around and you know do more things

00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:37,990
but majority of the users don't get too

00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:37,990
many don't get too many features

00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:27,790
all permissions presentation very much

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,510
