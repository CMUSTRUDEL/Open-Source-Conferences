Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Scopey Changey Management in Drupal 8
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Scope management is critical to the success of software development efforts. Scope is the summary of things we want the software to accomplish - and a constant opportunity and negotiation around the details. These negotiations are a delicate dance of listening, reframing and striving for creative communication clarity.  

Add in change, which as they say, is the only constant. Toss in a dollop of differing technical approaches, and often times we’re crossing our fingers that what results will be palatable.

Throwing Drupal 8 into the mix  matters even more. With nearly 5 years of development and planning, an entirely new PHP standards-based layer, new front-end templating engine, and larger, more full featured ‘drupal core,’ Drupal 8 provides us an opportunity to talk about scope in a new way.

In this session, we’ll discuss the basics of scope and change management - ideas and techniques we’ve honed in managing hundreds of software projects.  We’ll then review how Drupal 8 shakes all of this up - which we see as a great opportunity to reimagine how the Drupal community considers scope. Finally, we’ll play some scenarios to pull everything together. For example, if we allow the Drupal 8 core to move us away from thinking about features as “modules,” what does that mean for the software we develop?

all right um hello everyone welcome to

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,580
our session scope each Angie management

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,040
and Drupal 8 we're just working out some

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,630
change management on the fact that a

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,820
Google likes to just you know

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,000
re-engineer their UX for all of their

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,000
tools at the best possible time so

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:35,640
so we actually can't get it to work so

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:40,559
we're without speaker notes so forgive

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,000
us if we go far astray and so we're

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,040
super excited to be here in New Orleans

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,080
everyone having a great time so far for

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,850
Steve drupalcon all right and so we'll

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,739
just kick off with introductions my name

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,050
is Molly burns I'm an account director

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,160
with phase two I've been around the

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,440
Drupal space since Drupal 4.7 and and I

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,380
was one of the early content managers

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,660
for one of the largest early corporate

00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,450
Drupal platforms in Drupal 5 in Drupal 6

00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,479
so I've sort of seen all of those dark

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,550
days and edge cases around checkboxes I

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,130
remember when the blocks page you

00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,289
managed it with moving changing negative

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,680
numbers and negative integers and that

00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:24,360
was the administrative experience and

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,399
fast forward to now and i'm working on a

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,530
Drupal 8 platform and I did a triple 8

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:30,840
site last year so it's just amazing to

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,910
see the software and this community

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,640
evolved over the years and super excited

00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,869
to be here talking with you all and fun

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,479
fact about me is that I'm a crystal

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,369
collector an avid rock hound actually

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,369
have one with me right now so

00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:02,450
project management office I have been

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:06,290
working with PHP since HP three I built

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,410
a digital asset auction program when we

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:14,840
couldn't license from ebay and a CMS

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:18,530
back in 1998 2000 so I'm probably older

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,319
than most of you a complete dinosaur and

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,600
i also have a lot of experience with

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,100
object-oriented programming so I'm

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,330
really excited to see how that will play

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,209
out in Drupal 8 okay so just briefly

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:35,180
about phase two I hope that many of you

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,790
have heard of us we conduct digital

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,660
transformations for clients from digital

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:45,260
strategy through web apps and websites

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,930
we probably have about 40 projects

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,019
running at any one time so we have tons

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,819
of experience in managing scope and

00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,000
change and we hope to share that with

00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:58,550
you today

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,519
so I'm we want to start off and talk a

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,840
little bit about I'm some 00 g moments

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,050
so I don't know if anyone's ever been in

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,510
a project and your stomach drops so

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,299
something comes out of nowhere and

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,330
everyone's making a fuss and that that's

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:16,340
that's the mode where we operate in so

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,620
we sort of wanted to kick kick this off

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,250
and share some some person personal

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,319
zero-g moments so the story that i'm

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,239
going to tell isma for my first project

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,069
at phase two first party that i was

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,890
launching at phase two i was working on

00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:33,860
a university site we were upgrading from

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,599
Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 and I don't know if

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,360
anyone's ever worked with the University

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,060
or been a part of university but you

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,220
know University IT a lot of times it's

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,410
you know legacy systems are hosting a

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,629
lot of authenticated users in-house very

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,879
complicated there's a lot of characters

00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:52,190
people that have been there for 20 30

00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,410
years that are running these servers so

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,319
it's definitely a new world in a deep

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,670
world that I learned a lot about and we

00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,109
were doing this project and we were

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,280
we're trying to get the servers ready

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,290
and they needed to be requisitioned

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,420
internally in the University and there

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,880
was a whole lot of complicated steps to

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,170
that and we were at our final week when

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,690
we were supposed to get the servers and

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:15,019
I get an email that says that the

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:18,320
sysadmin was stung by 20 bees the day

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,299
before and I was first of all like is he

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,520
okay look at what's going on but

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,590
secondly just sort of like okay now now

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,910
we're definitely going to be delayed and

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,500
so we had we had to work through that

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,120
but I just remember being like of

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,070
anything else that could go wrong with

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,050
the with these servers now there's a

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:44,660
bunch of bee stings involved on the

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:47,780
scene okay hi is that better okay I had

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,910
built this personal fitness goal

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:56,810
tracking app for a start-up and

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:58,639
literally at the 1159 59th our the

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,760
product owner the owner of the company

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,430
decided that she wanted to pivot and

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,490
have the entire product now be a

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:14,420
management by objective goal-setting app

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:16,610
for the financial industry right she has

00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,370
she got her investors on board with this

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,950
and we reused as much as we could but

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,020
there was just so much that was just had

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,810
to be scrapped so that was probably the

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:31,670
most extreme case of a scope change that

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:34,220
I've ever experienced so in the name of

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,210
kind of the after lunch lull and also

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,880
because this is an interactive

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,860
conference I wanted to just spend a

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,020
couple minutes for folks to maybe share

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,850
a story one of their jeer at zero g

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,620
moments with either the person next to

00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,540
them or a group of three if that makes

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,400
sense um just to sort of get us

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,530
connected and also kind of grounded in

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,090
this and also to meet some new people

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,670
because that's one of the goals um so

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,650
just take a few minutes to maybe Sharon

00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:03,020
you know this is not you don't need to

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:05,180
name any names um yeah and then we'll

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,010
does kind of a tap this mic and will

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,660
restart up again once you guys have a

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,950
chance to talk through that a little bit

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,950
so yeah

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,650
you

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,620
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:44,850
alright what's kind of um five more

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:47,959
seconds to wrap up I'm really sad that

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,880
nobody had anything to talk about

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:53,490
because I feel like our projects go

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,899
wrong every single day and I'm just so

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,290
impressed that you guys really had

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,940
nothing to say to each other okay so

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,700
let's run through what we're going to

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,959
talk about today so we're going to talk

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,000
about starting with goals oh just one

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,020
quick note we obviously are going to

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,370
have a sci-fi Space theme to this

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,770
presentation so just bear with us as we

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:20,790
build that so we're going to talk about

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:24,420
starting with goals methods for

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:27,750
controlling or managing scope how to

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,240
deal with change then we'll talk about

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,029
specifically Drupal aid and how some of

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,529
the factors of Drupal 8 will impact how

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,390
we manage scope and change and then

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:42,360
we're going to do a couple of scenarios

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:43,890
to kind of tie it all together so um the

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,620
first thing that I want to talk through

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,680
is what we do and we start off any

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,570
project or product build which is define

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,430
our goals what what are we doing are we

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,779
going to the moon or we go into Mars are

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,630
we building a platform are we building a

00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,149
site are we trying to drive donations

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,220
for a non-profit what what is the goal

00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,320
that the system is accomplishing and

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,120
everything we want to be doing in our

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,700
projects we want to be able to trace

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,589
back to the primary goal or secondary

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,100
goal sometimes projects have you know

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,779
several goals and they are kind of you

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,459
know mostly align but sometimes if

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,529
they're in competition we work on

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:22,260
prioritizing goals and figuring out how

00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:24,930
we can achieve both goals or three goals

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,709
but getting a sense of before you even

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,870
commit a line of code or you know decide

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:33,750
on your technology it's really important

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,209
to figure out what your building and why

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,410
you're building it and I can't tell you

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,029
how many times people are like let's

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,199
just start building let's commit code we

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:41,670
want to start immediately we want to get

00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,720
going i want to get going why is it

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,100
taking so long to start it's like

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,649
believe me

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,959
you are going to be very glad that we

00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,790
spent two weeks walking through your

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,579
requirements helping you define your

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,410
goals and getting refine on why we're

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,639
doing what we're doing because when you

00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,050
get into the thick of the project

00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,759
through some of the scenarios were going

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,360
to talk through in a bit having those

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,670
goals as your basis and your constraints

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,310
for coordinating and collaborating and

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,600
defining how you're going to approach

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:18,089
different things that come up in the

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:19,920
project is so critical kind of cheese

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,949
alee grabbing the definition of scope

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,560
from google some of the words that i

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:27,839
really like here are opportunity and

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,339
deal with and I like deal with in terms

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,410
of like oh my god this is another thing

00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,690
we have to deal with and I also love

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:38,370
that some of the synonyms include both

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,199
gamut and confine so there's so many

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,139
contradictions when we talk about scope

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:48,329
but what we like to define it as is what

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:50,790
we are working on and so as I mentioned

00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:52,589
earlier I'm an account director so I do

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,259
i do a lot of work sign up on the the

00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:57,720
high-level planning and strategy working

00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,480
with different product owners and this

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,160
this process of scope management once

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,680
you have your goals the next real

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,170
process for me and what I kind of do a

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,100
lot of is this process of transmuting

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:14,160
confusion into clarity so every project

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,899
usually starts with a scenario where

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,610
someone is trying to explain to someone

00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,370
else something that doesn't exist yet

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:24,269
and in that process there are a lot of

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:26,639
like assumptions involved that come up

00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:28,800
and we're really working through I'm

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,839
trying to tease out what someone's

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,930
understanding of one of one requirement

00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,019
is versus how we're going to actually

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,519
map that requirement to a set of tasks

00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,920
that can actually be achieved by a

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,769
developer or site builder so that's a

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,610
big big part of the scope management um

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:46,610
so

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,330
so let's say we're going back to our to

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,330
our spaceship where we're building a

00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,470
spaceship we have this box we're

00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,089
expecting that we're going to open this

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,520
box and we're going to get a spaceship

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,490
and this is what happens actually with a

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,920
lot of Drupal and CMS build projects

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,900
that I I encounter you know people are

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,600
like great we're signed up we're doing

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,970
the drupal we assume we open the box

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,320
it's all there we just you know it's

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,790
painted up two weeks we got our site

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:22,210
right okay well a lot of times you know

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,070
it's really important to you know talk

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,110
through what exactly people's

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,670
expectations are and you know they're

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,890
not necessarily going to be getting the

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,200
hyperdrive spaceship when the box is

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,300
opened what actually they're going to

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,650
get when the box is open is a pile of

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:41,110
Legos and these pile of Legos are great

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,720
content modeling tools and extensible

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:48,040
CMS framework there is a ton there that

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,830
can be modified and you know configured

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,270
to achieve business goals but it's not

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,330
going to be out of the box that

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,980
hyperdrive spaceship that some people

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,709
might be expecting you haven't done a

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,170
technology project before and really

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,750
doing this a piece of Education around

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,970
the work it takes to put together and

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,220
align all of the pieces and you know

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,500
with Drupal 8 we've got so much in core

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,160
and it's a lot of opportunity for site

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,260
builders but there's also a lot of time

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,450
and care and expertise that goes into

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,370
how to configure the system so it's

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,550
really going to be the best possible

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:28,540
system for for the end users and for the

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,459
product owners so it's kind of in my

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,010
experience having the conversation early

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:35,410
on about what is what is in the contents

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,779
of the box when you get it with Drupal

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,150
is really really important to start the

00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,950
conversation with that that confusion

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,410
into clarity that's one of the big ones

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,540
that I always really start with upfront

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:52,630
in the projects just like okay this is

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:55,300
what's in our box okay okay and I guess

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,610
that's one thing to take advantage of

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,890
being here a drupalcon is to learn

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,390
what's in the box and what's not in the

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,250
box because that's an important piece

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,940
communication to have with your product

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,500
owners okay so we talked about starting

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,840
with goals i'm going to walk you through

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,130
some other techniques that we use to

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,780
manage scope so first we're going to

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:23,200
define our features and i want you to

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:24,700
just listen right like particular if you

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,590
come from a technical background or

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,840
you've been working in technology as a

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,240
project manager for a long time like you

00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,400
can jump ahead to oh here's how we could

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,070
do this or here's how we're going to

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,260
stop like quiet your solution mind and

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,450
just listen a lot of times when you're

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,580
thinking about how to do something you

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,200
might miss something really important so

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,360
first we're just going to listen I'm not

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,620
talking waterfall here we're just going

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,020
to listen so someone's going to say I

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,150
want the wings of this ship I want the

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,160
hyperdrive of that other ship I want the

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,020
invisibility cloaking device of the

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,850
other ship we're just going to listen

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,910
and write it down somewhere because

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,160
don't think that we can get it all and

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:08,170
then I want a quidditch pitch on the

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:10,660
landing deck okay so now that we've

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,190
written them all down now we can talk

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,440
about what our technical approach would

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,400
be and again this is not waterfall it's

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,170
not that we're going to write everything

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,420
down and go away for two years and come

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,370
back with a web app it could happen in

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,690
the course of a single conversation but

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,090
it's important to do those things

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,820
serially once we figure out our

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:33,730
technical approach we have some idea of

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:36,190
the cost the cost could be time it could

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,530
be money or it could be effort but once

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,320
we get our heads around how to make

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,960
those features become software we have

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,030
some idea of what those trade-offs are

00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,220
going to be and that's when we can

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,500
define scope so we have goals we have

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,720
features we have technical approach we

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,840
throw them together in this matrix that

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,140
measures value in cost and then we have

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,080
an idea of what kind of what what's

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,449
really important right so things that

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,550
are off the chart it is highly unlikely

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:10,460
that we're going to do those

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,650
d drive know right like it's too

00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,210
expensive is it really that valuable

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,400
that it's off the chart valuable in

00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,890
which case we need more effort or money

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,780
or whatever otherwise you can get into

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,360
conversations about other alternatives

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,490
right maybe we have the warp drive maybe

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,200
we would have a hyperdrive like what can

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,810
we do if we can't get that infinity

00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,120
drive also don't assume that just

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,620
because something is low cost and low

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,310
value that we're going to get it for

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,800
free it's low value so why do we even

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,050
want to talk about it so putting things

00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,390
up even visually like imagine doing this

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,700
on a wall or a virtual wall with your

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,490
product owners it really helps take the

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,330
heat and the emotion out of things when

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:56,180
you see it based on these kind of facts

00:17:52,330 --> 00:18:00,530
so we use this a lot to help manage

00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:03,970
scope so conversation alert scope

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:07,400
management is completely a team sport

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,950
the entire dev team the entire product

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,190
owner team all the stakeholders need to

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,860
participate in this it is a conversation

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,600
it's a collaboration and we push

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,990
ourselves toward finding creative

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,960
solutions at phase two we actually have

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,930
practice conversations of scope with all

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,260
of our clients it's outside of the

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,360
fraught pneus of real project scope

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,360
changes we do it in a really abstract

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,790
way so that we can practice having these

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,230
conversations about trade-offs in things

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,600
that for things that don't really matter

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,030
and the more we do this then we are

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,130
practiced at getting away from the

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,290
finger-pointing or the panic and moving

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,850
into a solution space so i would highly

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,520
recommend whether you are actually

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,380
practicing as changes as you're

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,060
developing scope or as changes occur on

00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,890
your project but to have these

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,110
conversations is going to be key for you

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,750
to manage things if you're just emailing

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,210
you're not you just don't have that

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:10,010
human connection which is really key for

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:12,440
scope management so now that we know

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,050
kind of spaceship or building and we've

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,210
got the gamma rays coming from outer

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:20,570
space and we weren't expecting them to

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,970
be here so you know

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:26,389
every project as I mentioned before with

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,960
the bees and can can have some things

00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:32,809
called unknowns or changes that come on

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,240
and that's life as well as software

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,950
projects them it's the only constant

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,830
that we have in this ever-shifting world

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:46,250
so when there is a problem which there

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,120
inevitably will be a quote problem i'm

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,250
going to talk through just some

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,769
strategies about how how to work through

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,470
and manage change so if anyone's

00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:56,870
familiar with this very famous Apollo 13

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,250
moment where they have a problem with

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,710
the spaceship and they call down to

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,139
Houston and everyone on the ground in

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,909
houston immediately gets to work with

00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:06,649
the folks on the spaceship to start

00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,779
problem solving now had they seen this

00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:10,940
problem before no they hadn't seen the

00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,289
problem before but they had worked

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:17,840
through so many different scenarios

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:19,549
about how to solve related problems and

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
the teams had already been working

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:22,820
together or three through drills and

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,350
different scenarios so they were really

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,519
really well equipped to come together

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,320
and through an very ingenious you know

00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:34,940
set of events bring these astronauts

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,129
home so um that's definitely something

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,360
that you know back to what Ellie

00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:40,429
mentioned earlier and related to the

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,909
team sport is that everyone in in the

00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:46,840
project can can be a part of the team to

00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:49,909
get to us to a place where we can manage

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,679
unknown scenarios so this quote actually

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,059
comes from Donald Rumsfeld it came out

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,789
during the whole weapons of mass

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:57,139
destruction thing which you know i won't

00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,870
opinion aid of whether or not that was a

00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:02,600
known known or not however i will share

00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:06,529
that on this quote actually came up

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,570
because it was used in a technical

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:10,730
approach meeting that was put together

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,379
by the lead developer on the bees and IT

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,450
project that I worked on his name is ray

00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:17,570
Stewart and he did this great

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,970
presentation for the client about the

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,769
Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 migration process

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,740
and he started with his quote and he

00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:26,929
walked through all of the different

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,000
known knowns all the different known

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,460
unknowns and then he also started to

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,170
posit what could be things that were

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,090
unknown unknown

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,760
types of unknowns on notes that might

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,550
come up in the project and this was

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,080
again my first big project and I just

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,930
felt like it was such an incredible

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,320
learning experience to see the the lead

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,970
dev actually be managing a change in

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,970
this way and I've really taken this with

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:56,200
me through throughout on to a lot of my

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,960
subsequent work and such great projects

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:03,290
but um you know the concept of the

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,850
unknown unknown is a little bit sort of

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,550
funky so I kind of want to walk through

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,650
this example so anyone heard of the

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,050
planet Mercury you know closest to the

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,690
Sun all right if anyone's been reading

00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,570
the news yesterday there was this big

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,580
moment in astronomy where mercury was

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,290
I'm sort of doing this eclipse thing was

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,700
called a transit where mercury was kind

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,800
of marching in front of the Sun and

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,740
there's this like you know NASA writing

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,080
news about it so that's totally a like a

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,440
no-no like we know mercury was

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,410
transiting the Sun um but there's also

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,890
sort of an unknown unknown about mercury

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,990
and it's called mercury retrograde so

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,550
mercury retrograde is actually a term

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:47,930
from astrology and it refers to when the

00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,910
when the planet looks like it's moving

00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,850
backwards in relationship to earth and

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,010
it's different folks in the in astrology

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,370
world kind of you know out there stuff

00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,930
you know but believe that you know the

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,480
actions and the movements of the planets

00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,090
in the heavens might actually impact the

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,540
daily life of people and may actually

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,950
impact certain things like web servers

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,780
you know I've had a lot of experiences

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,670
during mercury retrograde where some

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,920
servers are going down maybe it's

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,850
mercury retrograde maybe it's not we

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:23,300
don't know but that's just one example

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:26,000
um so now let's talk about some

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,590
strategies for actually managing risk

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,350
and getting ahead of these unknown

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,540
unknowns so um the worst time to

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,240
actually have a conversation about how

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,070
to manage risks and what solutions

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,410
you're going to put in place is when you

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,690
are covered in actio plasm on the

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,450
spaceship in your fire suits in the

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,909
middle of a huge fire the best thing to

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,159
do is to talk about these things before

00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:52,129
or hand so that when you are in that

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:56,409
there's a problem moment you already

00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:59,029
have a basis to go from to work through

00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:02,450
solutioning so some of the strategies

00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:04,759
that I'm a really big fan of our regular

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,849
risk meetings I'm working on a project

00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,529
right now it's a Drupal 8 platform build

00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:11,539
so we're building a Drupal 8 platform

00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,489
it's going to be the basis of a platform

00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:15,950
for a major media company and the

00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:18,799
project came in was very very rapid and

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,710
there's a lot of stakeholders even

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:25,399
shifting goals so we decided earlier

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:27,559
early on like hey we need to have to

00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,119
risk meetings a week and we need to talk

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,249
through all the risks and the mitigation

00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,989
plans openly and collaboratively with

00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:35,570
the product owner and in the first

00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:36,590
meeting I remember a tagging partner and

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,639
I said you know they said this is my

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,649
favorite meeting I said you're gonna

00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,669
love this meeting and initially she was

00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:43,129
a little nervous she's like all right

00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:44,599
risks sounds kind of scary and by the

00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,369
end of the first meeting she was like I

00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,859
get it this is my favorite meeting

00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:51,109
because we were talking about the risks

00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:52,879
before they even happen what we were

00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:55,039
seeing and then we were putting plans in

00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:56,749
place to mitigate so that you know the

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,849
hardest thing to do is is see something

00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:01,399
coming and feel like you can't stop the

00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:03,830
train right but if you are getting ahead

00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,599
of risks with an with open transparent

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,460
mitigation plans this is a little

00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,820
screenshot of the way that we track

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:13,849
risks in this project you know you're

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,519
able to really start to prep and get

00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:18,200
ahead another thing is important when

00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:19,519
you're launching website so i don't know

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,090
how many people have had a situation

00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,679
where you know there's been a launch

00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,720
event that's happened and something

00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,849
crazy has happened like a Drupal 8 site

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,869
that I launched last year it got

00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:33,919
completely spidered by some unknown an

00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:35,359
entity that was out on the internet that

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,249
had been scraping their old site and

00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,289
pulling the content into some content

00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,960
repository that when we launched the

00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,789
site it started to scrape the new site

00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,229
but it was like out of nowhere and it

00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:50,749
caused a lot of stress on the database

00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:54,470
so so that that's just one example of

00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:56,330
you know how how in launch protocols and

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,919
roll backs we had actually had a whole

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,019
plan for what to happen if there was an

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,350
issue at launch and so when it actually

00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:02,419
did

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,010
happen we we caught we work we calmly

00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:07,700
had a plan and we moved into the

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,890
solution a mode um so there there is

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,140
another category of risks that I want to

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,450
talk about which are sort of a more

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,860
tactical and long game risks i like to

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:21,440
call them and these are risks on where

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,510
you can say it in the beginning but

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,500
either people aren't ready to hear it

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,730
they need more evidence or it's just it

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,760
needs to have a little bit more of a

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,230
case built for something to move and you

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,679
know this happens a lot especially when

00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,919
there are a lot of different

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,480
personalities involved so in in the case

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,179
of managing a long game risk I often

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,730
sort of will work too with the project

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,470
teams with the product owners to lay out

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,840
the plan and work from multiple angles

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,580
and a lot of times there will be a key

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,960
moment of message delivery maybe it'll

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,450
be in a meeting or it'll be in the

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,880
context of a sprint review and in that

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,909
moment it's really great to think about

00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,890
who's going to be delivering the message

00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:05,350
for this kind of aha moment for sort of

00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,350
a risk solution just sort of unfold and

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:15,080
um so you know in the in the context of

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,640
this of this aha moment a lot of times

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,620
what I'll do is I'll tee up a

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,500
conversation that I know needs to happen

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,780
and I use these on what I call the

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,190
Metaverse meeting tips these are some

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,440
meeting tips that actually came out of

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,260
when i worked at this big media company

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,380
in Drupal 6 30 political lots of big

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,150
meetings and politics and so the tips

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,409
are really simple and they help you get

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,600
to this long game risk management

00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:41,600
strategy it's does this need to be said

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,700
right now do I need to be the one to say

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,600
it and if someone else has to say it

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,669
like how do I make that facilitate

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,130
that's that conversation to happen and

00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:53,510
you know a lot of times all i'll be in a

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,429
meeting or i'll have a meeting coming up

00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,780
and i'll be working with a tech lead or

00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:58,820
one of the requirements folks that we

00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,320
work with and i'll say hey at a certain

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,669
point in the meeting i'm going to turn

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,260
to you and I would be really great if

00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:05,990
you could say that a thing that you said

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,059
to me yesterday and then they'll say it

00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,610
and then it'll start the conversation

00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:14,060
and move us towards a solution so

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:16,040
definitely you know working through

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,910
these conversations from a strategic

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,710
standpoint both in the mitigation plans

00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:24,440
and also in sort of the more delicate

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:28,100
long game risk management are really

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,320
helpful okay so once again we have the

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,440
conversation alert so because you have

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,150
practiced talking about risks right

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,910
people are afraid of risks they think

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,100
it's a bad word it is not and if we try

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,540
to put our heads in the sand about it we

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,060
are always going to be caught off guard

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:47,360
when change happens and the hits

00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,790
the fan so if you have practices like

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,610
you've written down what do we do when

00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,350
new droids come in well we got to take

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,470
them to the garage and clean them and

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:59,300
only then can we whine about wanting to

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,630
go to Tashi stage and to get some power

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,980
converters right that if we have not had

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,530
that conversation we're going to be

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,240
standing there whining and nobody wants

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:12,020
that it doesn't help us move forward at

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,630
all okay so now we've talked about scope

00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:18,470
and change and now we're going to talk

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,840
about Drupal 8 and how that may change a

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:26,030
little bit or influence or impact how we

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:27,260
manage scope and change great so as I

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,700
mentioned earlier you have been around

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,410
Drupal for a while and I've sort of

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,790
seeing the system evolve and it was

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,320
really great to be in Greece's keynote

00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,630
today and see all of these things

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,370
especially the admin experience be like

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,890
you know forty six percent or seventy

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,510
two percent of the focus so there's a

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:44,420
lot of great stuff that's happening in

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,190
Drupal 8 and it's you know I've been

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,780
working with it this is I guess coming

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:51,130
into the second year of working with

00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:54,130
Drupal 8 so there's definitely a lot of

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,300
new things there and sort of new

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,160
wrinkles that have come come into play

00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,890
when managing the projects that I just

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,110
want to kind of talk through so just to

00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,060
sort of give give you guys like a

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,520
high-level summary I mean I know people

00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,230
are pretty pretty aware of a lot of this

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,650
stuff but i'll just talk through some of

00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,870
the highlights and things that i

00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,060
particularly have kind of gravitated on

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:20,750
of what's in drupal 8 so there's been

00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:23,930
sort of a major major rethink of the

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,790
drupal 8 admin experience in the ux

00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,320
which is definitely huge when we talk

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,860
about what we're getting out of the box

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,360
right

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,850
we there is definitely a lot of

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,429
improvements there and you know we also

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:37,130
have tools like views which I don't know

00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:40,100
if people know views it's a module used

00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:42,290
to be in Drupal contribs base but it was

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,420
sort of like a requirement basically for

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,530
building condoling complex content lists

00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,740
and pretty much doing any kind of

00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:50,240
querying so now that that's in core we

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,780
also have a complete rethinking of the

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,990
multilingual and then in addition we

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:59,480
have the configuration management which

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,580
is really a layer that's been built on

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,710
underlaying Drupal that allows you to

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,059
move the database configurations which

00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,490
are all those check box and all those

00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:09,620
settings easily between environments so

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,559
that your site can be more stable and

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,710
last but certainly not least there's a

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,559
brand new front-end templating system

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:21,350
which has been introduced in Drupal 8

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,540
it's based on twig and it sits in with a

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,830
lot of the other PHP breasts practice

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,460
libraries that have bought it that have

00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:30,070
been brought into to Drupal 8 but you

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,240
know it's important to also note that

00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,640
back into kind of what we're getting in

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,799
the box that we still have things in

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,590
Drupal that are sort of Drupal isms that

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,280
are part of the framework of the system

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:46,640
that were within one of the best

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,710
examples is the the pager count so back

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,980
in Drupal 5 I was when I was queuing

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,190
sites I saw well it says I'm on page two

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:59,120
but the URL says page one which seemed

00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:02,120
extremely broken and you know I logged a

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,090
bug index starts at zero well I mean

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,480
that's not how people count unless

00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:14,210
you're a computer programmer or computer

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,790
um so you know that that is still that's

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:19,010
still in in in Drupal and you know it's

00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,380
definitely still something that you know

00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,510
worked as designed or won't fix so um

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,570
there still are things like that that do

00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:28,340
come up and I think it's important again

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,500
understand the constraints of what what

00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,700
the boxes and how the system is and if

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,740
you're going to be trying to change

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,990
something like that just understanding

00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,880
the the cost that it might take to try

00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,650
to flip something we really need this

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,630
thing to be moved down you know it's

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,360
like now you don't really need

00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,720
or maybe you do and like if you need

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,510
that then then we can prioritize it so I

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,340
want to talk through the module so

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,990
everyone knows I'm in Drupal or if you

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,630
don't know modules are sort of like

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,230
those extra Legos that you can add on to

00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:03,140
make the trip even more full-featured

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:05,360
and in Drupal 7 and before there was

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,740
tons and tons of mods modules in the

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,470
contribs base that you could add on to

00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:13,430
your site and to basically get a site

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:15,800
that was relatively like functional

00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,200
usually you needed a fair amount of

00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,050
modules like you know at least like 30

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,760
modules you know you needed modules to

00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,530
do content list you need a module to do

00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,960
layout management you needed modules to

00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:29,600
do even vanity URLs you need a module

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,400
for a WYSIWYG you needed modules like

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,320
features to do your configuration

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,640
management so you could you know move

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,220
your configuration through different

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,010
environments so there's a really you

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,070
know deep amount of contribs Aaron

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,750
Drupal 7 in Drupal 8 a lot of these have

00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,970
actually been pulled into Drupal core

00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,250
and you can actually get started and

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,680
building a site and the modules that are

00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,660
in Drupal 8 you know are there obviously

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,980
are modules and there's a healthy

00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,260
contribs base as well but they're sort

00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,350
of even more specialized and even more

00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:03,710
kind of you know flashy features or

00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:06,050
special kinds of caching or workflow and

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,000
you know just as an example on the

00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,950
memorial sloan-kettering site that

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,899
presented on last year drupalcon I think

00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:15,080
their previous site in Drupal 6 have

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:16,820
like over 150 modules the Drupal 8 say I

00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,149
think launched with under 20 I think it

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:23,210
was 9 contribs so I mean that's the

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:24,800
amount of difference and we'll talk a

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,600
little bit more about sort of where some

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,370
of that other code goes which is you

00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,040
know potentially in custom modules and

00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:33,020
some extensions but you know I've also

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,730
seen a lot of kind of RFPs or people

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,620
have talked about their Drupal 6 site

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,899
and they say here's all of our modules

00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,850
are you upgrading all of them and the

00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:42,830
answer really is no no we're not going

00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,780
to just start upgrading all of your

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,550
Drupal 6 modules one by one to Drupal 8

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,260
is we're going to look holistically at

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,419
what you need to accomplish and really

00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,760
understand how we can do that in Drupal

00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:55,250
8 and then back into what modules we

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,310
need so that's the module

00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,170
conversation and then sort of kind of to

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,700
roll all the module conversation

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,860
together I want to kind of come back to

00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,950
the to the global because the global

00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:09,440
aspect of Drupal aid is a really great

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,600
example of how the the modules have been

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,880
condensed and brought into core so um

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,640
when I worked at the the media platform

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,910
in Drupal 6 we had a big global site

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,640
platform right you know sites and 20 30

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,820
languages there was about like 20

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,670
modules needed just to get the thing

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,860
translated localized URL routed country

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,920
codes translation imported everything

00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,260
was on like six different screens of

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,990
checkboxes and you had to go to like

00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:43,220
four places to just turn swedish on your

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:45,140
site and you know now now with drupal 8

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,170
I mean that whole process has been

00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,540
completely you know rii architected and

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,250
integrated into course so on the Drupal

00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,810
platform that I'm working on now we

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,270
needed to spin this side up in another

00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,590
language and just to show something to

00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,270
see how would look on right reading

00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,540
right to left and we did it in like

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:04,460
under an hour and I was just like

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,350
shocked because before there was a lot

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,600
of time spent pulling the patch from

00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,490
this modulo we need to patch this module

00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,260
this patch is can in conflict with this

00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,960
thing just to get something like that to

00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,610
work so you know this example sort of on

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
a small scale of kind of what we're

00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:22,550
seeing overall now with the the sort of

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,980
weight of module interactions and patch

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,270
management that is a little bit

00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,460
different from previous versions of

00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,920
Drupal to the furniture bowl and and

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,530
then I want to talk a little bit about

00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,450
front end magic which I alluded to a

00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,640
little bit before but this is really

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,710
exciting and definitely will be

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,870
impacting a lot of people's projects and

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,080
the templating engine that's in Drupal 8

00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:47,180
is called twig 2p it's a modern PHP

00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,800
templating engine you don't actually

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,780
need to know like drupal eyes PHP which

00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,970
you did need to know to theme a Drupal 6

00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,500
in a Drupal 7 site i remember when i

00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,600
worked at this media company that the

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,240
skills needed for a good drupal theme ER

00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,550
was like so specific it was like you

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,060
know a list of like JavaScript amazing a

00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,660
JavaScript CSS HTML plus PHP plus two

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,619
gender book

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:14,359
fig and now there's so much exploding in

00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:15,980
the front end world there's all these

00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:17,750
different JavaScript frameworks react

00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,819
reyes angularjs got a lot of people

00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,410
talking about headless drupal and we

00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:23,690
really do have an opportunity to

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,740
integrate a lot of the best practices

00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,880
and a lot of the cool stuff that's

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,920
happening in front end development

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,770
without necessarily having people to

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,390
like fit it into drupal and the mark-up

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:36,200
can be cleaner which was always a big

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:39,140
sort of you know fiery point of all the

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,180
drupal femur purists who love front-end

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,970
development but like also really want to

00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,700
make beautiful markup so that's

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,410
definitely something that I think you

00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,849
guys are going to be probably you know

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,410
interacting with a lot and the

00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:53,000
opportunities for like bringing in

00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,770
people that haven't even worked with

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,809
Drupal on the Drupal 8 project that I

00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:00,349
worked on we actually had the front end

00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:02,030
that was designed and built built by

00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:03,710
design agency and the front end

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,539
developer she had never done any drupa

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,510
before we were able to integrate it and

00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:10,460
we got about 80% code reuse wasn't

00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,549
completely headless but um it was it

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:19,160
really did work which was pretty

00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:22,670
incredible so um the last thing I want

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,680
to talk through here is this concept I

00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:27,020
call stack inception so mentioned that

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,089
we've pulled a lot more stuff into into

00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,950
core right there's a whole lot of

00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:34,099
different layers we've got Symphony the

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:37,220
PHP layer we've got composer dependency

00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:39,529
management we've got twig we've got this

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,170
thing called big pipe I kind of know

00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:44,690
what it is there's all sorts of stuff

00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,609
that's under the hood now and what that

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,589
means is that there's a higher level of

00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:51,650
complexity when it comes to debugging

00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:53,569
and edge cases and especially when

00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:55,609
you're working with a lot of different

00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:59,140
layers and you're trying to extend

00:38:55,609 --> 00:39:01,059
things within within Drupal core so I'm

00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,970
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:06,020
the what the stack inception what it

00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:10,760
means from the object-oriented

00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:13,430
programming perspective okay so I want

00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,529
to talk about object orientation because

00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,349
it's going to be important for you guys

00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:20,779
even as PMS to know some of the basics

00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:22,340
of it it will have an impact on how

00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:26,350
you're going to manage your project in

00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:29,390
ways okay so an an object is an entity

00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:32,840
that could be a physical thing or an

00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:34,610
idea or a part of code so it actually

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,640
can be all of those things which makes

00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:40,390
abstraction or thinking about goals to

00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:46,310
features to actual code a little simpler

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:49,550
it has state and behaviors so it has

00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:51,680
something and it can do things and

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,030
there's these four elements that object

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,130
orientation makes possible so

00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:58,250
abstraction that allows us to think

00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:00,470
about things not in their messiness but

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:03,230
as clean things right so when we talk

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:06,440
about goal feature code encapsulation

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,870
allows me to hide my mess from you so I

00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,020
have an inner my object has an interface

00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:15,620
it will give you a piece of data you

00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:18,530
send me the command it could be a pain

00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,150
for me to gather what you need but you

00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,130
don't need to be bothered by that it's

00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:24,430
pretty sweet so that's one of the key

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:28,070
benefits of object orientation

00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:33,440
modularity so an example of object

00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:35,780
orientation in life is the the universal

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,170
remotes so I have a remote that will

00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:42,560
work on my sony and my philips in my LED

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:45,290
or LCD what's i can't remember the name

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:49,160
whatever then another TV i don't know

00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:51,440
whatever LG thank you thank you so it'll

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,030
work on all of those because we've got

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,070
these interfaces that we can talk about

00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:59,840
and sometimes we call them api's and so

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,820
modularity is the idea that at one point

00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,090
we might have had like a settings

00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:07,940
interface that then it basically dumps

00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,920
me into your mess on your sony and it

00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,060
dumps you into the LG mess right and

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,800
then you've got all these menus i'm

00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,450
going to click all this stuff there's

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,280
some benefit in that but there's also

00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:19,280
benefit in having like an input

00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,750
interface where i can then choose what

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,520
my input is going to be much more easily

00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,080
so that's an example of modularity and

00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,150
then hierarchy you guys know what that

00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,110
means there's no hidden meaning here it

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:34,370
basically allows that we can inherit

00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:36,980
from objects so this is rudimentary UML

00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:39,170
to kind of explain some of the concepts

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,750
of object orientation so our parent

00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:43,550
class here is a vehicle we're not even

00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,230
showing some of it states but we've got

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,680
some behaviors like we can count tires

00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:53,380
we can return an engine type and we can

00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:56,030
go so these are the vehicles that

00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,200
inherit from vehicle and you can see how

00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,210
they're going to have some different

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,810
things right so airplane is going to

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:05,930
need to extend vehicle because it's got

00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:08,660
to have something to do with wings you

00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:10,550
could argue and boat similarly like the

00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,680
tires are less important but it's got to

00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:14,570
have some flotation stuff so they're

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,750
going to take vehicle and make it

00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:19,520
different a spaceship might be so

00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,620
radical that you might say maybe it

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,230
shouldn't even inherit from vehicle and

00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:27,230
you could also maybe say maybe spaceship

00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:30,310
and airplane have a relationship right

00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:32,780
so see how I'm talking I'm talking about

00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,490
things in the abstract and how they

00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,920
could relate to each other and how we

00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,480
can build on them and that's kind of how

00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,240
you start thinking when you think about

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,430
objects so then we've got car which

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,560
breaks down and note that we have some

00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:48,920
namespace stuff going on with Tesla and

00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:52,670
Mercedes S and that's a key part of the

00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,160
name spacing within PHP and Drupal note

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,920
that Tesla has two parents like inherits

00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,000
from car but it also inherits from elon

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,790
musk he above him has a really long

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,230
hierarchy of entrepreneurs and great

00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:12,920
thinkers so he's not like born like that

00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,630
he has to inherit them and but he's got

00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,200
a new method he's going to pass in which

00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:22,760
is share it and so if you are building a

00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,950
car from Tesla you're going to have

00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,020
share it and you're going to be able to

00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,600
through that do things that you couldn't

00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:32,930
do with mdx without getting sued by

00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,300
acura so does that make sense so when

00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,910
you start to think about things you can

00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:43,010
see the power that comes from using

00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:46,820
objects okay so the key bit for Drupal

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:50,810
is that you don't need to hack

00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,250
or so I saw a guy with the eye hat core

00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,900
t-shirt and I wanted to take a picture

00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,810
and say sweetie you don't really need to

00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:00,320
do that anymore because what you can do

00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:02,120
is extend core so you can take all the

00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,460
glory that it is but you need to do

00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,890
something different you don't have to

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,740
patch it you can just take it and modify

00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,900
it and have it be your own thing so we

00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,510
could say that mark Watney modifying the

00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:17,180
mavs in the Martian was either a total

00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:20,150
hack or the most desperate and beautiful

00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,800
extension ever but that's the basics

00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:24,830
that's going to be key as you're

00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:28,150
managing projects okay so the final

00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:30,230
thing about object orientation is that

00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,420
well this is really about software

00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,770
development in general so inevitably

00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,450
your product owner is going to say is

00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:40,670
that possible like I've gots a great

00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:44,150
idea is that possible think about it may

00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:47,540
be possible but just because we can do

00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:50,630
it doesn't mean we should do it right so

00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:53,960
shooting Bruce Willis and a ragtag team

00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:56,180
of miners up to destroy an asteroid

00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,790
might have seemed like a good idea but

00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,830
was it really necessary so again when we

00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:03,920
think about the goals and the features

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:06,320
and the implementation keep that line

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,660
right to every time is that possible

00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,730
sure I used to say we can do everything

00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,590
except make Cindy Crawford come out of

00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:15,590
your monitor but do you really want all

00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:17,060
that sometimes people would want Cindy

00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:20,950
Crawford to come out of the monitor but

00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:24,350
thankfully that wasn't possible ok so

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:26,840
here we go ok so now we're going to do a

00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:30,230
little bit of role playing on our

00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,000
holodeck these are our holodeck hats so

00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,790
when we're in character will be wearing

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,670
these hats I am going to be the project

00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:39,800
manager and Ally is going to be our

00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:41,870
developer and we're going to have a

00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,750
conversation about our Drupal a project

00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:46,370
that we're working on and hey Ally

00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,600
thanks for agreeing to me such last

00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,240
minute I know you've been working hard

00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,190
on the sprint so I just got a review

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,730
meeting with a product Tina the product

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,890
owner and she was asking for a tweak to

00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,759
the comments page apparently it's really

00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,679
critical that we move the comment box

00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:03,689
from below the comment listing to above

00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,429
the comet listing since it mirrors the

00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:06,899
current system that were rebuilding and

00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,669
it would be a big win for stakeholders

00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:10,139
for them to feel like the system is

00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:12,149
going to be somewhat like the old system

00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:13,769
I told her that it didn't seem like such

00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:15,329
a big deal we could probably fit it in

00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:17,189
but I wanted to check in with you and

00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:19,139
just see your thoughts of you know how

00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:21,089
we could strategize to get that in yeah

00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,099
well actually like feature be that we've

00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:24,659
been working on we thought I was going

00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,130
to take this front next sprint but I

00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:28,919
think we're going to actually finish it

00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:30,419
this sprint so write it up and we can

00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:33,239
take a look at it if it's important to

00:46:30,419 --> 00:46:39,779
them let's pull it into an expert okay

00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:42,509
great thanks right okay it's a week

00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:46,829
later and we're at our Tsar sprint stand

00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:47,939
up and so Hayley I wanted to know if you

00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:49,499
could give your update what have you

00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:51,329
been working on the last twenty-four do

00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:57,569
you have any blockers what's what's

00:46:51,329 --> 00:47:00,469
happening okay so that comment boxing oh

00:46:57,569 --> 00:47:04,199
my god I don't even know where to start

00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:06,739
okay so I've kind of figured it out but

00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:09,209
so it started as a javascript error and

00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:11,939
so I've been trying to just debug where

00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:13,799
it's coming from I'm not really sure I'm

00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:15,869
just going into modules like I never

00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:18,059
thought I would but I mean thankfully

00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:20,399
I'm kind of able to to do some debugging

00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,019
but I just have no idea I don't know it

00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:24,959
could take me an hour it could take me a

00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:29,849
few days I just have no idea but it can

00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:32,039
be done by Friday right I I don't know

00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:35,459
it could take me a few hours or a few

00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:36,689
days okay i just thought when you said a

00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:40,139
few days I just thought maybe friday

00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:42,149
would be it would be done but um has

00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:43,949
anyone else like seen anything in Drupal

00:47:42,149 --> 00:47:46,380
8 have you have you saw i saw this issue

00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:48,179
before know this is totally new i mean i

00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,039
think we kind of talked about it as

00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:52,799
unknown unknowns with using drupal a

00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,779
like this seems really edge kc but it's

00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:57,779
a total pain i'm really having to debug

00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:59,130
the hell out of it okay well that's

00:47:57,779 --> 00:48:00,509
really good to know thanks for the

00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:02,130
update i think i'm probably going to

00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:03,839
have to give product Tina call and just

00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,109
give her the update and start to manage

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:10,469
expectations around this all right thank

00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:11,190
you all right so I want to take off our

00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:14,520
hats for

00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:19,200
it I'm gonna get a little meta here um

00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,819
so what should i do the project manager

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,829
so I have a few options I'm going to

00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:25,560
walk walk through them and then we'll do

00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:27,869
a little voting so my first option is i

00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,250
can i could push back on le to get it

00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:31,319
done no matter how long it takes be like

00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:33,119
look need you to work all night you have

00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:34,710
to get this done you said you can debug

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,000
it in a few days but what what have you

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,400
spent 24 hours could could you get it

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,010
done faster so that's option one option

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,349
two is i could just kind of like quietly

00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:45,690
like every hour like send her and i am

00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:47,310
and just be like hey how's the comments

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:50,160
going and then maybe the end of each day

00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:53,190
send her an email just just do you know

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,109
to make sure it's moving forward I could

00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,670
on I could go I can call a product teen

00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:59,099
of the product owner and tell her that

00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,569
we need one more week tas is a little

00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,540
more complicated but that it was going

00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:06,240
to be definitely be done by next friday

00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:07,829
or i could raise this in our risk

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,190
meeting and work with the product owner

00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:12,869
to find the right solution on mitigating

00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,369
so if everyone can just clap for their

00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,410
one and we'll go through the number so

00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:21,829
for number one who thinks we should do

00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:28,349
number one number two number three

00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:32,490
number four alright so now you know kung

00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:35,480
fu I wanted to lecture a little bit

00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:39,240
about why we don't do these things so

00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,250
number one is like molly is acting out

00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,690
of fear and total ignorance like without

00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,220
checking with the product owner she

00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,470
doesn't really know whether it's so

00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:49,109
important that she's going to put in her

00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:52,619
chit for can you work overnight and so

00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:54,420
she'd be just wasting number two is not

00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,270
only the same but totally passive

00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:00,720
aggressive which has no place in product

00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:03,990
team number three is just do it's almost

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,849
the same as number one it's working from

00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:08,010
ignorance and panic she's going to set

00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:10,859
an arbitrary date that we may not be

00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:14,180
able to fill so that kind of narrows us

00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:18,630
down to having number four as the

00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:21,300
sometimes hardest but most efficient and

00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:23,490
effective method

00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,520
so we're going to go back into the

00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:36,570
holodeck and this time Elly is going to

00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:38,640
be product Tina so all right hey product

00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,680
Tina how's it going rate I'm totally

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,510
excited to hear how things are going how

00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,360
awesome well the team has been doing

00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:46,950
really well sprint to we're really going

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,960
through the points things are coming

00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,340
together it's exciting to see the system

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,860
we've been talking about for the last

00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:55,230
month and a half actually coming to

00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,550
fruition so I'm super excited that

00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,980
you're going to be excited when we do

00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,330
the Sprint review meeting next week but

00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,790
I did actually want to talk to you about

00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:04,530
I'm a risk that's come up and get

00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:06,180
together a plan to how to mitigate it so

00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,920
do you member the feature that you

00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,510
called me about last week that moving

00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,180
those comments to the top of the list

00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:14,700
yeah so I'm we've actually come across

00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,290
I'm some pretty deep javascript bugs and

00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,750
errors that are sort of deep in the

00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,370
system I'm actually related to some some

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:23,460
Drupal 8 edge cases that we've come

00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:24,720
across so the sort of risk issues that

00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,630
we don't know if it's going to be done

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,450
by this friday as originally planned

00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:32,130
what yeah my boss is coming to town on

00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,720
Friday she totally wants to see that I

00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,700
know that you don't think it's really

00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,950
important but for her it's super super

00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:40,830
critical oh my god you guys have to get

00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,690
it done yeah I totally can't do this to

00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:44,580
me Molly all right product Tina I

00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:46,170
totally hear you and I was actually

00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,810
thinking about this because I know how

00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,310
important it is for her to see the site

00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,870
and this feature that's a little

00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,520
reminiscent of the old platform so she

00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:55,380
has confidence and she can share that

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,670
confidence of stakeholders so I was

00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,380
thinking about this and here's the plan

00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:00,720
that i put together let me know what you

00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:04,200
think so what if we pulled together i'm

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,490
a small deck that sort of recapped a lot

00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,260
of the features we've been building in

00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,730
this sprint some of the ones that we

00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,100
have actually replicated from the old

00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:12,990
system and then we could even put

00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,090
together a couple of slides about the

00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:17,460
process for the comment box and where

00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,080
we're at and actually circling back to

00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,780
that unknown unknowns that we walked

00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,970
through in the product kickoff and kind

00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,320
of I can actually also invite Elly to

00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,090
come to the meeting and maybe walk

00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,890
through those specific slides just so

00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:30,750
she has some confidence and we can be

00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,830
really transparent about it I'm so I

00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,510
wanted to see if that would be something

00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:35,540
you'd want to collaborate on so that we

00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:40,079
can work on this together

00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:42,329
okay well first I think I need to

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,460
apologize like I I know we've we've

00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:45,960
talked about the unknowns unknowns for a

00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,670
long time I don't really think I

00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,290
understood what they were until this

00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:53,940
moment so I'm sorry I totally acted out

00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:57,599
of a place of emotion I'm really glad

00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:59,819
that you moved us into solution space I

00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,410
think that would work like I remember

00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:03,240
when we talked about unknown side nose

00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,650
with my boss she was kind of into it

00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,740
like she thinks that were like in the

00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:09,390
new frontier with Drupal 8 so I think

00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,680
that sounds good as long as we can keep

00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,809
showing her that we're making progress

00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,430
on the other fronts she actually might

00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:17,819
be kind of psyched that we've uncovered

00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:19,710
something that's totally new okay great

00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:21,390
so I'll work on pulling together the

00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:24,089
deck and then we can set up a review

00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:28,880
meeting like um wednesday before your

00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:28,880
big meeting okay great all right thanks

00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:41,549
okay i think that the take-home is that

00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:42,930
conversation is key so whenever i'm at a

00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:45,030
party and i tell people that i work in

00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,680
tech sometimes I'll get a response like

00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,000
oh my god it must be so great you're

00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,020
working with computers all the time you

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,859
don't have to deal with people right and

00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:58,559
I think oh my gosh it's all the humans

00:53:55,859 --> 00:54:01,559
like it is so much easier to just code

00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:04,260
it up then to deal with the humans and

00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:06,660
all the baggage that we have and so one

00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,520
of the keys for us in managing scope and

00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,040
managing change and even with dealing
