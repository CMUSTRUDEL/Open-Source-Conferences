Description: 
	Abstract:
You can greatly increase client satisfaction by tailoring an administration experience based on their perspectives and needs.

Key Take-Aways:

The importance of putting yourself in their shoes, you have to forget what you already know (Method Acting)
Why the ultimate success of a solution can come down to whether or not the content creators like to use it
Finding the ways in which different people have different workflows for different jobs
The ways in which administration experiences are only going to become more and more important
How Drupal can get the admin experience ~90% of the way there in just 2-3 hours of effort
How you can add most of the work into your companies default Drupal profile to establish a baseline
Some tips specific to D7 & D8


How many times have you been faced with a client that has an unfair opinion of the Drupal Admin?

Ever had a critical stakeholder request Wordpress over Drupal because "Wordpress just feels more user friendly”?

The Drupal admin offers a level of flexibility and customizability that makes working with most comparable systems feel like swimming in shackles. So why such a bum-rap? Despite how enabled developers are to customize the admin, as the sprints run out, the budget runs low, or a hard deadline approaches; the admin has a tendency to be one of the first things to get sidelined.

The most important step is to put yourself in the shoes of non-Drupal savvy. You must think like the stakeholders that will maintain the system as their job. What content will they frequently edit, when could they benefit from a custom list provided by views, when could one extra filter or column save them hours of work each week. We have the power to help get these folks home on time each evening, and it is in the best interest of the entire Drupal community that we make that a reality.

alright I'm going to go ahead and get

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,950
started it's a five o'clock so hi I'm

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,540
Tom I'm the senior technology consultant

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,519
at metal towed up in Portland Oregon

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,740
I've worked with Drupal for the past

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,509
four years though I've been building

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,690
websites one form or another since the

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,820
mid to late 90s these days though I do

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,949
have to admit I do a lot more consulting

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,880
and what i would call proxy product

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,349
owning than i do coding but because of

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,869
that new role that i'm in i get to spend

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,030
a lot of time with our clients I get to

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,680
form a lot of empathy for the folks that

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,670
are actually going to use the solutions

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,920
that we're building so how many of you

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,600
out there at some point in your life

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,610
some point in your career had a job

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,809
where you had to enter content into a

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,989
system and how about a little bit less

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:57,149
savory of a role how about a title of oh

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:59,430
that's just say data entry and how many

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,620
of you folks ever had that sinking

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,260
feeling at the bottom of your gut that

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,360
man I think I can build something better

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,570
than this this program that I'm being

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,970
forced to use right now I know I

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,430
certainly did I had that feeling and

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,350
years ago I acted on it next thing I

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,220
knew I woke up in Portland I was a

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:25,170
developer I some point had two kids and

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:29,280
we got a pug yeah that's pretty much

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,259
rock bottom but anyway um you know this

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,180
talk I want to give you today it's kind

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,970
of zoomed out it's very abstract it's

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,229
really applicable to d7 or d8 and if

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,299
we're really honest a lot of these

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,000
concepts are applicable to any CMS or

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,890
any framework it's it's really more

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,720
about taking you know an abstract

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,520
approach to the admin experience and

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,590
thinking of it from the users

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,390
perspective you know it's building

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,530
something that somewhat custom tailored

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,579
to the people that are going to actually

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,560
use it now before we again I want to

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,090
share a case study with you of what not

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,860
to do that I did not just because it

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,369
highlights a time that I horribly

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,619
fumbled the ball but because this story

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,710
is largely what inspired me to do this

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,750
talk

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,430
so back when I was first learning drupal

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,690
you know I just I just started learning

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,140
drupal when I went to meddle to it about

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,000
four years ago and a friend of mine was

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,940
starting a small fudge company they were

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,830
in a Cell fudge and I was more than help

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,800
happy to help this friend of mine set up

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,420
a website drupal in hand I managed a

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,310
crank out a fully functional site in

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,970
about two hours even being relatively

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,010
new to Drupal now don't judge me you

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,510
know my design skills are pretty rusty

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,390
at this point it's been many years since

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,220
I was was into that realm but you know

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,600
it's just very excited at how easy it

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,570
was to just set up this functional

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,630
website then it came time to show him

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,210
how to use it I want to give you a

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,650
little bit of context this this person

00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,970
this friend of mine is someone that I

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,540
have a tremendous amount of respect for

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,100
he's a very sharp person he even

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,990
tinkered with doing some web development

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,420
back in the 90s you know this is someone

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,830
that knew how to go in and do HTML and

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,600
ftp back in the day and he even already

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,810
maintains a website for one of his other

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:22,520
businesses so while not a developer this

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:24,860
person is fairly tech savvy so we

00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,630
started out with how to add and edit the

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,310
fudges this was easy enough you know i

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,840
went in showed him the content area you

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,880
know here's how you add content here's

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,270
how you filter down here's how you edit

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,690
and he was stoked you know this is great

00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:45,650
is what he said then he asked me about

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:47,900
making new pages well explaining page

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,300
manager in panels you know that was a

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,530
little bit of a challenge I mean he

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,120
still thought it was great he was still

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,920
kind of following me but you'd see as I

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
start to glaze over a little bit as I

00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,410
got into some of the details which I

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,120
probably shouldn't have and then he

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,910
asked you know what if I want to change

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,410
all these colors at some point well

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,720
thanks to the theme i installed that was

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,850
a big win you know this to him was

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,160
amazing he you know it took me a few

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,100
times showing him where to find it you

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,420
know being off in the settings but he

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,890
was thought it was so cool he'd be able

00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,060
to change the colors of his sight just

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,500
by going through a color picker but then

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,669
he asked you know he needed to add

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,330
something wanted to add a few things

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,250
into the foot

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,319
well unfortunately the way I set it up

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,490
the footer in the header were blocks so

00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,240
then I had to go over and show them the

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,550
blocks section a little bit except the

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,979
footer menu was in fact an actual menu

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:45,680
so then we had to head over and look at

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:47,509
menus and then he asked well what if I

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:54,979
want to make some changes to the list of

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:56,569
fudges page yeah well that was a view so

00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:57,560
you know I'm just like hey you know what

00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,270
we probably just want to get into that

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,919
today I mean I just totally dodged that

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,330
topic then he casually mentions you know

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,150
I'm thinking about changing the slogan

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,379
and I actually used the site slogan so

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,550
then I had to show him like where that

00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,050
was which I probably should have just

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,580
dodged that one too because it's like

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,569
way off in left field compared to

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,409
everything else we were looking at and

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:23,300
then then I realized wait a minute I

00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:24,680
totally forgot that as I'm just sitting

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,139
there drush commanding that I turned on

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,669
the in place editor and you I probably

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,639
should have shown him that first because

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,080
that's another way to edit all the thing

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,710
a lot of things I had already showed him

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,300
how to edit but in a different place and

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,830
by this point I look up at my friend and

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,759
I see the look on his face and I thought

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:46,580
oh my what have I done I mean he's just

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:53,419
slowly slowly sinking into his beer as I

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:55,400
show him all these things and then it

00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:59,259
happened then he said something that

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,370
sent a chill down my spine he said

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:07,610
wouldn't this just have been easier to

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:11,810
do it in HTML the reason I had a chill

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:15,409
is because I realized for him he was

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,449
right for him someone who edited HTML

00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:20,779
back in the 90s and knew that type of

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,430
structure for a site this simple he

00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,830
probably would have had an easier time

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,960
with that as opposed to all the

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:30,800
information overload that I just gave

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,129
this gentleman to this day almost three

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,840
years later he has not updated this site

00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:38,610
not even added a new fudge

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,400
and for some reason I still haven't made

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,180
it better form so that don't be my

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,070
friend apparently so from that moment on

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,690
you know I came to think of Drupal admin

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,610
from a slightly different angle you know

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,100
I tried to make sure to give it a little

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,910
bit more upfront thought and you know

00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,660
planning is I go into setting up a site

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:01,860
so lessons learned for fudge minimize

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,389
the number of touch points for the

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:09,930
content authors make custom views for

00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,820
focused content administration use roles

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,440
and permissions even if there's only one

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,910
user trained gradually and by topic

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,400
don't try to just dump it all on them

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:25,770
and plan as you build always think to

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,360
yourself how will it sound when I

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,620
explain this to the user there's another

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,300
reason I'm passionate about this topic

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,590
and apparently it's the same reason that

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,050
juries is very passionate about this

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,460
topic I was glad to see how aligned I

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,700
apparently am with the community and

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,530
injuries this morning all of human

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,110
knowledge needs to continue to getting

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,160
up to the cloud and we're at a point now

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,210
where it's not going to be just

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,889
developers doing it gone are the days

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,400
when the internet was just us building

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,960
it call it web 2.0 or open web or

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,470
whatever the term is these days it'll

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,510
change next month but as the internet

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,660
evolves we find ourselves no longer

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,250
building the internet as much as we're

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,470
building the systems and tools that

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,740
enable non-developers to populate the

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,630
internet beyond just content created by

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,460
the general public businesses are waking

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,550
up to the possibilities that the web and

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,099
cloud soft soft wares can bring so that

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,700
what the web and online software can

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:29,190
bring to their businesses they have a

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,919
need for centralized locations to store

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,599
information and assets this is a very

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,089
common topic that comes up when I speak

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
with our clients they want one place

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:40,050
where their employees can follow to

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,300
standardize workflow around content

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,510
entry and maybe even extending the core

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,790
business data then they want to open up

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,440
access to that content to be used by any

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,279
number of applications that their

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,930
business made

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,850
s 10 or even outside of their business

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,680
enter the content once in one place by

00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,819
one person they don't want to train

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,129
their employees using several different

00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:05,370
systems or pay them to manually retype

00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:07,529
things over and over again so where does

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,579
droop will fit well that depends on the

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:13,439
situation drupal is not likely to be you

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:15,749
know a core piece of a core business

00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:17,550
system for a large enterprise for

00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:19,259
example you're not likely to see Drupal

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,839
selected as the stack to manage

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,749
inventory supply chain logistics for

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,319
Nike anytime soon it's just probably not

00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:29,519
the right tool for the job but what

00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,430
about a scenario where you need an

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,959
extremely flexible content portal that

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,360
can handle shifting business needs for

00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,029
the next three to five years I mean sure

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,069
absolutely you know what about a

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,529
situation where you need complex admin

00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:46,529
functionality like workflows and user

00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:48,449
permissions sure you can slap workflow

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,490
in their organic groups you may be

00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,319
saving months of work compared to if

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:57,449
you've chosen another another framework

00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:59,610
or solution with Drupal 8 the community

00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:03,059
is being extremely proactive and reading

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,129
Drupal for the CMS focused future d8

00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,420
brought services in the core and now as

00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,579
we saw this morning I mean it's just

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,360
continuing with you know the dedication

00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:13,470
to serving content to outside systems

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,089
well there are plenty of our articles

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,559
out there you know talking about why d8

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,899
is amazing I'm sure there's plenty of

00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,809
sessions here today about it I want to

00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,809
focus on just one fact the DA is ready

00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,839
to be more than just a website and let

00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,639
that just kind of sink in for a moment

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,259
you know d 8 is going to be laying the

00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,179
groundwork for Drupal to become an

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,230
extremely flexible content

00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:39,029
administration and workflow platform

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,980
while other technologies are the vehicle

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,970
who through which people actually

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,069
consume that content the Drupal

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,050
communities foresight here is going to

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:52,800
make Drupal and innovative solution well

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,929
into the future so that's enough about

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,850
Drupal let's talk about them the

00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:59,959
non-developers the potentially non-tech

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,800
savvy the people that this is all about

00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,630
people

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,700
people were why we do what we do

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,810
everything we build is ultimately meant

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,250
to be used by people for the most part

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,850
both the public facing front ends and

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,800
the content creating back ends all of it

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,779
meant to be used by these folks and we

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,200
can't lose sight of that the second we

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:25,800
do what we start to build become simply

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,890
functional functional rarely equates to

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,930
inspirational people want more than

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,300
functional people want an experienced

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,000
people want to be happy people want to

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,959
be efficient and what they're doing

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,690
people want to derive pleasure from

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:44,430
their everyday experiences people want

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:45,959
more and people deserve more why do we

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:50,149
love to use Drupal at metal toad in

00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:52,980
short because Drupal empowers people

00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:55,529
your average person with average

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,600
computing skills mang0 programming

00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:01,709
experience can be placed at the helm of

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,630
a fortune 500 companies web property our

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:07,860
work makes it so that they can do their

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:09,300
work we empower them if we just wanted

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,800
to build a website we could use any

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,510
number of frameworks out there I mean

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,000
we're coders we're not afraid to write

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,980
some code but we use Drupal because of

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,250
the freedom that it gives them our

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,050
clients and our partners when thinking

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,820
about those people using our solutions

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,350
always keep in mind that there's a lot

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,660
of content authors out there where it's

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,450
their job they're spending forty plus

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,510
whoever who knows it's America maybe 50

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:36,930
60 hours a week creating content for the

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,579
systems that we build they just want to

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,190
do their jobs as painlessly and as

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,750
efficiently as possible how will they

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,870
know if the solution we build is not

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:50,399
efficient because they use it most of

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:52,740
their waking hours people have

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,149
preferences because they're going to

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,980
spend so much time using these things

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:59,579
that we've built they're going to have

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,959
some opinions and rightfully so some

00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,339
people like things like the in-place

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,699
editor they like to be able to click

00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,410
around browse and edit other people

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:11,160
would much rather have data in a tabular

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,170
format if you haven't ever check out

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,279
pipeline deals com I think you can do a

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,410
demo on there

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,589
it can give you some great inspiration

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,689
you know any user can go in you can have

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:24,300
your own preferences filters your own

00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:26,670
control over columns you know just the

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,639
overall control of a highly scrubbable

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:33,050
inline experience my emphasis is on

00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,699
scrubbable by quickly scanning a list

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,559
admins can quickly spot outliers and

00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:44,009
then go in and edit right in the list

00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:47,850
itself trees also kind of stolen my

00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:53,149
ideas here people favor simplicity how

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:55,050
many of you own an apple product or five

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,389
think about how much work went into

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:01,470
making that device as easy to use as

00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:03,959
possible but simple is always harder

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,029
than you'd think but what does that mean

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,809
for us it means that we cannot take the

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:13,910
easy way out if we take the easy way out

00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:13,910
then we are making it difficult for them

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:20,309
we do with change all the time I haven't

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,439
done much development the last couple

00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:25,439
years you know my world now is mostly

00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:28,980
all you know product dining project

00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:31,259
management discovery projects but every

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,420
now and then I get the edge so recently

00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,069
I hopped onto a project and found out

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,899
that everything and how my company

00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:40,589
handles front-end apparently changed

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,839
when I wasn't watching all of a sudden I

00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,480
had to get node set up so that I can npm

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,399
and I had to get Bauer and gulp going

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,500
ironically had finally just like two

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,069
weeks earlier sat down and learn gulp

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:57,240
which last I knew we were using or I'm

00:14:53,069 --> 00:15:00,720
sorry I grunt and even if someone who

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,300
spent most of the past 15 years as a

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,790
developer person who's dedicated to a

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,230
lifestyle of constant change I just got

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:12,689
this feeling in my gut of you know here

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,579
we go again a whole other ecosystem of

00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:19,740
things that I need to learn just so I

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:21,540
can make one little CSS change I felt

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,179
this way because most people have some

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,769
degree of fear when it comes to change

00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:27,670
this is especially true if it involves a

00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,770
process that they do day in and day

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,740
out and they've come to think of as

00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,420
routine if you walk into a client's

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,950
office and you talk to the stakeholders

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,290
about building new software that

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,880
automates parts of their job they're

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,550
going to have at least some degree of

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,620
anxiety this type of fear and

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,410
uncertainty to some degree is human

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,850
nature so if they seem angry or

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,250
resistant to the change that you

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:55,390
represent don't take it personal you

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,980
know it's most likely not about you but

00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,560
if you're ever going to earn their trust

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,070
you have to be empathetic and except

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,140
where they may be coming from because

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,350
people fear change they will tend to

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:12,160
cling to what they already know even if

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:15,430
it means you know looking at the wrong

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,340
solution to the problem I was recently

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,140
on site with a client we just started

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,810
doing a fairly large Drupal site with

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,850
them and as we talked I kind of

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,890
uncovered a need for them you know they

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,550
had a need to store photos somewhere

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:33,340
with a little bit of metadata and as I

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,960
talked to one of the stakeholders she

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:39,490
told me that they've been working on a

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:43,000
file maker for solution how many of you

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:47,470
know about FileMaker in FileMaker for it

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,270
was released in 1997 some of our junior

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,670
developers are almost as old or all you

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,230
know that solution is almost older than

00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,880
some of our junior developers at metal

00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:02,680
tube but they knew that system as

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,690
antiquated as it is they were

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,950
comfortable working with it and from

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,720
their experience they knew they could

00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:11,500
make it fulfill at least some of the

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,360
requirements that they had and times

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,490
have changed and with them expectations

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,740
of public perception what it means to

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,840
administer content best-of-breed

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,120
services and solutions have spent years

00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,410
in an arms race you continuously

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,050
one-upping each other on user

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,950
experiences as a result most of your

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,740
clients are going to be a tad bit

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:33,460
spoiled you know how many of you had a

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,750
client assume it would be easy to do

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,750
something they've seen in social media

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,059
services like envision Shopify you know

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,220
Squarespace you know take TurboTax for

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,630
instance look at how easy they just kind

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,340
of casually walk people through

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,980
something as complex is paying their

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,790
taxes now I've seen those tax forms they

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,210
really mask that very well but make no

00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:59,650
mistake that's what we're up against

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,990
that's what we're being judged against

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:09,010
in our clients minds now is that fair no

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,860
absolutely not but it is the way the

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,110
world works you know we have to be

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,240
conscious of that as we make our

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,710
interfaces you know they're not going to

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,059
be thinking about the millions of

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,290
dollars that someone some of these

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,460
companies can throw at you x

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,650
improvements all they're going to be

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,320
thinking about is well if it's so easy

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,669
for me to do this on Instagram why can't

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,110
I have this in this business software

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,110
that we're paying tons of money for

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,500
unless we forget people are vocal

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,150
they're going to talk and more

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,040
importantly they're going to talk to

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:43,030
their bosses about how they feel about

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,500
this this solution at some point the

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,270
directors or see suites are going to

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,980
come down and say hey that thing we

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:52,570
spent a ton of money on how do you feel

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:56,020
about it and this is why long-term

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,549
project success or failure can hinge on

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,360
whether or not the people who use it

00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:03,010
like it even if the site achieves all of

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,260
its goals meets all of its analytics

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,210
targets the public loves it your hard

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,720
work can still fill in the long term if

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,490
the people who maintain it hate it it

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
seems like a big world out there but the

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,750
bigger the client the smaller the world

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,950
some of our contacts out there they can

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,330
pretty much be the center of their own

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,860
Kevin Bacon game of enterprise business

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,270
having them speak poorly of a solution

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,700
that you've created for their company

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,919
not only impacts within that company

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,559
your potential future work with that

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,140
company you're your own companies you

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,570
know reputation but as they spread out

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,010
across other corporations that kind of

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:43,059
you know have a little bit of a ripple

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,799
effect and it may also contribute to you

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,840
know I'm sure we've all heard rumors out

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,110
in the wild of Drupal Drupal admin not

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,520
being very easy to use those rumors are

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,570
out there it can

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,550
just contribute to that so how do you

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,960
make them like it if you really want to

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,850
make your clients happy you need to put

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,480
yourself in their shoes you need to see

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,010
Drupal as they see it not as a developer

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,100
but if someone who's going to log in and

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,870
use it when trying to figure out what a

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Content administrator wants the first

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,100
step is to acknowledge your own

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:19,020
limitations we know software better than

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:22,780
most people I would hope that's our job

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,280
but people know their jobs they know how

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,440
to do their jobs the intricacies of

00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,220
their jobs all those things that we

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,550
don't know the key is to meet somewhere

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,430
in the middle if you willing to set

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:40,450
aside many of your own opinions you know

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:42,700
put your own mind set aside then we

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:47,650
truly do have the you know potential to

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,080
revolutionize their jobs odds are though

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,070
we don't know how to do their jobs

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,340
generally speaking they probably don't

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,860
know what's possible but by combining

00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,060
forces you get the best of both worlds

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:04,270
and everybody wins so how do we do that

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:05,740
well we do a little recon if the project

00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,020
is big enough for not clearly defined

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,180
I'd recommend you push for a small

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,740
discovery project some people will call

00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,800
it a sprint zero though that name

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,940
sometimes it's not favorable this would

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,960
give you the opportunity to interview

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,280
system users directly when you're

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,560
talking through their requirements and

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,320
goals be sure to spend a little bit more

00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,190
time listening than you do talking

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,110
you'll have your chance to voice your

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,000
opinions later but make sure you take

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,550
full advantage of this time to hear what

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,470
they have to say hopefully you'll

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,480
consume that and be able to that will

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,830
have a huge impact on the opinions you

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:44,440
have in the solution you propose and

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,330
this is one of my favorites get a demo

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,070
we're so used to going out and giving

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,810
demos we're always you know especially

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,310
those of us that do any type of sales

00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,720
engineering you go out there and you

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,790
show people stuff you try to get them

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,550
get them hooked and want to come in and

00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:01,540
do a project but we need to get a demo

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,760
if they've already got something in

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,900
place let the client walk you through

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,730
what they use today

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,570
this not only shows you a step-by-step

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,310
process of what they're used to using

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:15,720
but frankly it shows you exactly what

00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:17,980
you need to be significantly better than

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,390
so recently we went on site with a

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,220
client they'd been using Microsoft

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,340
SharePoint for years and then they were

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,020
moving to Drupal yay as they walked us

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,090
through their day day to day in

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,410
SharePoint I had to admit SharePoint was

00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,700
actually a lot nicer than I thought it

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:35,470
would be at a very like zoomed out level

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,400
it actually kind of reminded me of

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,800
Drupal with monopoly installed vaguely

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,340
you know on a broad sense from their

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,490
perspective but having them give us that

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,460
walk through it completely revealed

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:55,000
about a dozen admin based user stories

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,860
that we hadn't been planning for these

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,110
were all pieces of functionality that

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,640
the the stakeholders had totally taken

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,560
for granted they didn't even think to

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,960
mention it they just assume that we'd be

00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,270
doing these things so prevent scope

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,800
creep early you know use the demo as an

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,630
opportunity to find out all the things

00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,390
they might not be explicitly telling you

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:18,730
because to them they're all unspoken

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:20,890
expectations if possible actually go

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,420
through the steps that they do maybe

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,310
done a local or if they have a test

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,280
environment you can play around with but

00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,170
actually load some content actually feel

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,140
their pain if they're coming to you they

00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,340
probably have some form of pain point

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,810
it's one thing for them to tell you

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,850
about it it's another thing for you to

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,470
live it as you go through the steps

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,760
constantly be looking for ways that you

00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,900
can make the process more efficient I

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,870
love taking inspiration from other

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:51,520
industries anyone here ever hear of

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:53,050
method acting basically it's when an

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,000
actor actress will spend an extended

00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:58,480
period of time pretending to be the

00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,100
character for an upcoming film iveth

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,450
friends and family for all intents and

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,860
purposes they are this other person they

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,300
do this so that when the camera rolls

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,560
that character is just going to flow

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,160
right out of them naturally and

00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,020
organically so years back I used to run

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,780
the e-commerce and the IT for the

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,460
world's first skateboard shop every

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,730
holiday season the online orders with

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,870
swell

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,700
to the point where the shipping

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,250
department would call for all hands on

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,830
deck every December I'd go down and help

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:30,250
them pick transfer pack and ship orders

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,860
and then every year I'd make a list of

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,790
all the things that were painful all the

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,610
places where we had room for

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:40,090
efficiencies in our processes and then

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,970
every January February beaten and

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:45,780
defeated and miserable from the holidays

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:49,450
I'd slowly lurk back to my office and

00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:51,160
then I'd start to take action you know I

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,230
all those things that I found to be

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,600
inefficient I start to plug all the

00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,100
holes in our processes it's all because

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,960
I spent some time down there with the

00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:06,760
users getting in touch with that actual

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:09,820
process made every gap completely

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,590
obvious so method acting can be a fun

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,120
exercise you don't have to take it to

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,830
the extremes that the actors do but

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,620
putting yourself in their shoes for a

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,570
little bit is a great way to get in

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,070
touch with what they're experiencing and

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,750
once you see the world through their

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,390
eyes it's going to affect how you

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:28,750
approach programming and interfaces

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,940
moving forward potentially the hardest

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,490
part of method acting is the exercise or

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,380
as an exercise is for getting what you

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,660
know you have to be able to put aside

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:41,890
everything that you've no in assume that

00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:45,640
you don't know Drupal always ask

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,750
yourself if you clear your head and say

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,530
the thing you're about to say to someone

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,390
that doesn't know what you know will

00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:56,710
they have any idea what the hell you're

00:25:52,390 --> 00:26:01,990
talking about if the answer is no circle

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:04,059
back and reword using framework specific

00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,000
language and I think we all know Drupal

00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:09,549
has a little bit of that but using that

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,690
type of language and expecting someone

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:12,429
to follow you I mean that's like

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,820
expecting someone who doesn't know Latin

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:17,919
to follow a conversation in Latin you're

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,330
the one that knows both languages so the

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:25,120
weights on you to translate all the

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:26,380
drupal speak to people speak and once we

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,059
feel like we've got a good grasp of our

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,020
stakeholders mindset it's time to apply

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:33,760
it as you look at the screen and I'm not

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,990
screen any when you're when you're doing

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,020
the development when you're looking at

00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,180
the back end of Drupal the content

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,070
management experience take a real

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:47,260
objective look at that screen and look

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:49,120
at all the pixels that you see are some

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,670
of them not actually important do they

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,360
not need to be there if you were a

00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:56,860
Content author for example are they even

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,820
going to use publishing options or

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:03,460
comment settings do not admins even need

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,400
to see large sections of the admin menu

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:09,340
for the management menu if the answer is

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,670
no then simply clean it up take those

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,280
things out for those people as you work

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,510
your way through the admin experience

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,840
constantly be looking for opportunities

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:22,000
to streamline the process for example if

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,850
they have a content type that's always

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,200
going to have lots of images like on

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:29,140
average each each node is going to have

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,300
12 images uploaded do you need to make

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:37,420
them upload one at a time or can you

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:38,680
install something like plupload so how

00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,600
do you determine how to win it the admin

00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,280
there are a few things that I like to

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,410
assess when I start talking to a new

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,710
client I like to try to figure out what

00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:51,160
you know how that client in particular

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:53,170
how those folks think now I try to group

00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,200
them roughly into what i like to call

00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,360
content management profiles depending on

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,460
where they land on some key metrics I'll

00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,300
start to steer the conversations and the

00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:09,040
tools I suggest for the admin around

00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:11,260
their their preferences drupal was built

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,720
to be anything for anybody which is

00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,720
exactly what makes it such an amazingly

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,270
flexible tool but the downside is is

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,360
that out of the box it's so the admin

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,770
area is so generalized that you know

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,850
it's not really great at handing

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,840
handling like any one specific scenario

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:33,300
well I can handle just about anything

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,300
it's streamlined for virtually nothing

00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:41,380
so some key questions that I'll start

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:44,170
asking folks you know how often is the

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,700
content at it you know they adding

00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:50,380
content every single day is it

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:54,460
week seventh how much value is placed on

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:56,139
each individual piece of content how

00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,090
quickly do they expect to be able to

00:28:56,139 --> 00:29:00,970
create a piece of content we recently

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,320
did a site for some folks that had red

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:06,850
carpet photos being taken and they

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,580
needed to be posted instantly and are we

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:13,419
talking high fidelity content here or is

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,639
this just bulk data and how tech-savvy

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:17,380
are the content editors that's a huge

00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:21,880
factor and what tools we provide for

00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:23,679
them now granted I'm going to make some

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,630
broad generalizations here about a few

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,880
demographics but remember these are just

00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:31,450
examples you'll you would apply this

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,409
differently in your own context so let's

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,380
take a quick look at a few scenarios

00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:37,659
scenario one I call the brochure where

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,019
let's say it's got 12 pages three

00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:43,299
content types most new content consists

00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:47,260
of blog posts and they add a new post

00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:50,860
maybe once a week content admins are not

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,000
tech savvy in this case so if we chart

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,500
that out it might look something like

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,630
this for this for a site like this their

00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,269
entire marketing strategy might hinge on

00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,960
a handful pages so those pages need to

00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:06,669
be relatively perfect if they have

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,260
internal staff there are a lot more

00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:10,450
likely to be designed focused than

00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,620
development focused it's worth filling

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,450
out whether or not these clients are

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,460
visually minded and what impact might

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,200
that have well they might be a little

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,360
bit more likely to enjoy clicking around

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,909
to make their chain edits in the front

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,240
end so if you're using d8 I mean spark

00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:29,019
will be great if you're on d7 you might

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,669
want to look at panoply you'll probably

00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:32,019
want to some spend a little bit of time

00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:34,360
you know setting them up with a decent

00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:36,789
WYSIWYG editor and one important thing

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,500
if these people are very visual make

00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:40,360
sure it's actually importing the CSS

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,980
styles from the site itself otherwise

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,760
what they're seeing isn't actually what

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,409
they're going to be getting and then

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,059
keep the ad admin as simple as possible

00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:53,159
you know these folks want to spend their

00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:53,159
time making content not using Drupal

00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,370
let's take a look at a very different

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,490
type of site i'll call this one the

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:06,130
information site thousands of pages

00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:08,789
dozens of content types a team of

00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:12,640
full-time you know content entry staff

00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:14,110
content added constantly and so we graph

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,840
that out and it might look like this

00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:20,559
relatively the opposite of the example

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,120
we just looked at these folks are going

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,620
to be more likely to be overloaded with

00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,740
the amount of content work they need to

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:29,380
do they may be dealing more with bulk

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,970
data as opposed to content the

00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,409
distinction I make their content tends

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,900
to have a little bit more thought behind

00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:38,620
it versus lots of stuff we need to jam

00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:40,390
in quickly these maintain errs likely

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,360
come from a world of spreadsheets and

00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,220
tabular data then you have to remember

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,039
those old dos based programs where

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,720
employees can or UNIX based as well

00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,370
where you could just tab through as fast

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,030
as humanly possible think of like your

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:58,150
bankers yeah those were really fast and

00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:00,850
really efficient to use and it's really

00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,530
painful to admit that these days but

00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,860
these people probably remember those

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,840
times as well in which case you know

00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,520
we're really competing with the clock at

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,440
that point I mean you're trying to make

00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,460
it as efficient as possible for them to

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,580
do a job so look at a few inline editing

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,440
options like vbo editable views there's

00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:23,620
some stuff out there that can help with

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,210
that if applicable maybe even look into

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,850
options that allow for quick imports of

00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,320
information from outside sources you

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,960
know we had a few content Edmonds on a

00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,640
project recently where every every week

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,159
they received an Excel spreadsheet that

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,900
had all this list of information that

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,940
they had to manually convert to nodes

00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,400
well that's you know the easiest way to

00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,200
make their admin life easier was to give

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,500
them the ability to upload that excel

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,179
sheet they just upload it once the nodes

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,980
get generated and then they just go in

00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,980
and make any edits that are necessary I

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,770
also recommend you take some time and

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,090
check out the great work the Commerce

00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,250
guys have been doing on Commerce

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,690
Kickstarter you know they're dealing

00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,250
with e-commerce folks people that deal

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,620
with lots of products people that want

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:12,910
to be able to you know do that scannable

00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,260
a browsing of a list you might be able

00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,580
to get a little bit of inspiration on

00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:19,990
how you might want to approach the madam

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,309
in stuff yourself from there also a plus

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:24,760
side for in this scenario these

00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:26,350
employees are full-time employees so you

00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,430
might be able to make some broad

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,720
assumptions that they're going to have

00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,790
some training available or the

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,350
opportunity to do some training and over

00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,640
time they're just going to get more and

00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:38,230
more efficient with the system that you

00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:40,780
provide quick overview of a few other

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,610
profiles now for you in the context of

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,470
your clients and the types of industries

00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,300
that you commonly work for you want to

00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,660
come up with your own but just to kind

00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:53,500
of spark the conversation you know in

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:56,380
these are some other like user profiles

00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:59,470
that I've kind of grouped into groups of

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,240
modules that we will use you know

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,540
speaking Commerce guys of course there's

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,860
the you know commerce site this is a

00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,940
group of people that are running a

00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,129
business they're going to want to be

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,600
able to maintain products very quickly

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:12,129
they're not going to want to be able to

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,500
have to click through the site most

00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:16,899
likely products are probably a very

00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,090
variance like small medium large versus

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:22,000
red blue and green so there's a lot of

00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:25,240
content management to think about there

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,620
and plus you got to keep in mind with

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,690
those folks they're also competing with

00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,429
Magento which has an admin that while

00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,649
kind of confusing at first is incredibly

00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:37,600
powerful and purpose-built to be an

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:39,129
e-commerce system then there's the

00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,690
community site I mean that's going to be

00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:42,669
all the content provided by the site

00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,600
visitors so of course then you're going

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:45,250
to want to kind of double down the

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,870
effort on making things as simple to

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:52,210
administer as possible for anybody the

00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,470
maintained by developers site that one's

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,409
kind of a double-edged edged sword

00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,480
because one in some cases you might

00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:01,240
actually not lock things down as much

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,420
you might leave a few doors open for

00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,650
them for later or the exact opposite

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,030
might be true if you're going to

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:11,710
continue to support the site after

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:15,070
launch and then there's the our content

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,810
lives elsewhere site and in this case it

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,700
might just be you know synchronizing

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,840
data in from an external source there

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,240
might be some work around providing

00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,760
workflow and a per

00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:28,140
rules or the ability to extend augment

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,680
that incoming data as its received sorry

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,210
let's get practical we know our people

00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,850
we know what to do or you know we know

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,490
what to do with that logic now how do we

00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:41,119
tailor this admin experience luckily

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,170
Drupal makes this extremely easy for us

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,119
I'm not going to go down the cliched

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,260
route and say that drupal's like Legos

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,530
because I've already did that in another

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,690
talk but i'm gonna compare drupal the

00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,400
sculpting clay sculptures can get a

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,730
brick of clay and mold it in anything

00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,210
they want drupal is not purpose-built

00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,740
and when its installed we can kind of do

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,990
whatever we need to do to make it become

00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,450
whatever it needs to become and when i

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,550
came to this this industry from the

00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,100
commerce ruled that was mind-blowing to

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,410
me you know coming from magento and

00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,480
various other cart systems where it's

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:22,320
not really super easy to configure and

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:23,760
change that and well that's amazing it's

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,470
only amazing right up into the point

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,820
where you leave Drupal's admin as it is

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:31,340
out of the box so first tip make the

00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,630
admin part of your overall plan

00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,300
factoring in very early into your

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,950
planning you know you have to plan for

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,260
it before you start building the front

00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,609
end because you've got to make some big

00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,280
decisions I mean you're dealing with

00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,240
panels or blocks even from that level I

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,250
mean that's going to have a huge impact

00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,340
on how people will maintain their site

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,980
and you've got a factor in the broader

00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,970
architecture decisions if you don't

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,320
you're going to end up at the end of the

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,820
project and if everything's confusing

00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,800
and no one knows how to use it it's

00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:06,470
probably going to be irreversible at

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:10,740
that point and keep the admin simple I

00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:13,350
say simple in regard that do not let

00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:20,150
easy access to complexity cloud your

00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:23,250
judgment Drupal is very easy to extend

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:25,350
which is why we love it but it's also

00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:28,440
very easy to just start throwing modules

00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,600
into it and turning them on if you just

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,940
start stapling things on and let it get

00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,170
sloppy it's going to affect perform it's

00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,880
going to it's going to affect a lot of

00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,290
things

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,510
try to solve complex problems with

00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,880
simple and elegant solutions which may

00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,110
or may not involve complex code a lot of

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,570
times it's just a matter of configuring

00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,100
what's already there generally speaking

00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,080
the things that you're adding to Drupal

00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,330
admin experience should actually be

00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:56,430
taking things away as opposed to adding

00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:57,660
more complex things to the workflow you

00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,430
can probably eliminate a good sixty

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,610
percent of user confusion just by

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:04,020
actually utilizing roles and permissions

00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,630
just a few minutes of configuration of

00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,850
these settings can have a huge impact /

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:12,060
what a Content author sees versus what a

00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:14,040
developer sees so we recently started

00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,020
working on a client that had already had

00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,440
a Drupal 7 site we inherited this site

00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:22,950
and it's a common story every user was

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,070
an administrator and one day one of

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:29,280
their new employees accidentally deleted

00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:32,160
a field instance from a content type but

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,080
whose fault is that you know should that

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,440
content author even have ever even had

00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:41,730
access to the structure Minh menu at all

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:47,640
you know probably not so on that note

00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:51,540
what people don't see can be equally

00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,700
important as to what they do see so look

00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,100
at all those links if I know nothing

00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:00,750
about Drupal that's a lot of pixels in

00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:02,460
my face if we did our job gathering all

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,290
the information and we know what types

00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,580
of user roles they have and we know what

00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:09,030
each user role needs to be able to

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:11,460
access we can very easily minimize

00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,490
what's even being presented to them to

00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,480
make it very clear where they need to go

00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:17,340
and with just a little bit more

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,470
configuration we can narrow that down

00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,820
even further it's going to be really

00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:24,080
hard for someone to go down a path that

00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,080
they're not supposed to at this point

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:32,070
custom content views or you know are

00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:34,580
probably the second easiest thing to do

00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:36,660
that I commonly have seen not get done I

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,310
mean even if you're using something like

00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,500
in place editor there's still going to

00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,810
be a lot of folks that prefer to go into

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:47,010
the back end and actually just edit in

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:48,570
this type of experience but there's lots

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,610
of great options Drupal provides

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,110
just by doing exposed filters you can

00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:56,010
sprinkle on some views bulk operations

00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:59,100
there's some great stuff there think

00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:02,940
back to your interviews are you making

00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:05,130
their jobs as easy as you can have you

00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,020
provided them with all the columns that

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,900
they would want to see in order to make

00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,500
the decisions that they need to make can

00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:17,520
you create a to-do list for that day

00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:21,420
just by providing a focal turd view for

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,310
example give a photographer a list of

00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,380
all the new products that have been

00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:29,550
added that have not yet had a photo

00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,720
uploaded or giving content approvers of

00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,610
you of all the new posts that the

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,980
authors have recently created that have

00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:39,930
yet to be been have not yet been

00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,490
reviewed to be published you know why

00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,780
make them search for all this stuff all

00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,150
these common tasks these things they're

00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,070
going to do day to day when you can

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,350
simply take a few minutes and set up a

00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,210
view the minutes you're going to spend

00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:56,640
doing this for them could probably save

00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:58,470
them maybe even hours each week and we

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,100
probably should not assume that people

00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:04,110
will learn views it's a safe bet that if

00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:07,410
they came to you they probably did so

00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:09,030
that they don't have to and to the non

00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,430
text you know the folks that are not

00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:18,380
super tech savvy let's face it views can

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:21,060
be very intimidating hiding Drupal speak

00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,910
that's all keep in mind node entity

00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,680
taxonomy panel context views even

00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:29,040
modules I mean these are all words for

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,080
us they're not words for them you know

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,230
update the management menu links when

00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,300
appropriate use things like jammer and

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,490
string overrides you know that will help

00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,620
you kind of tuck the drupal a little bit

00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:44,610
under the hood for these folks again i

00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,320
love taking lessons from other

00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:49,290
industries and that includes journalism

00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,970
the old inverted pyramid most important

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,820
stuff up top work your way down to the

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:56,220
less relevant how often are they going

00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,450
to edit certain content types ones that

00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,070
they're going to edit all the time

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,349
should be very accessible you'll

00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,869
probably focus some some nice you

00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:06,420
custom views in the management menu for

00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:08,430
them on those types versus ones they're

00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,829
not going to do very often maybe you put

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,269
a little bit less effort into that or

00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:13,799
things like configuration settings you

00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:19,380
know those can be accessible only to

00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:21,509
true system administrators and then the

00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,479
same kind of applies to fields there's

00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:26,940
rarely a time when Phil groups module is

00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:29,130
a bad idea you know any website that has

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,519
more than a handful fields on a content

00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:35,400
type put in field groups and start to

00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:38,489
actually organize content all the

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,009
required fields should be very prominent

00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,779
at the top of the form the things that

00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:45,690
they're going to almost always have to

00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:48,989
provide on every node should be grouped

00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:51,210
together and very upfront optional

00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:52,920
fields things that may maybe some notes

00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:57,239
might have every once in a while push

00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,190
those down to the bottom and dashboards

00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:00,839
can get a really bad rap and I don't you

00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,369
know I kind of buy into this too because

00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,710
so many software products out there

00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:06,630
everyone wants to have a dashboard and

00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,089
they build dashboards just for this

00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,400
little checkbox to say that our software

00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:12,809
as a service has a dashboard and as a

00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,239
result they usually put really mediocre

00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:16,920
content in there and we walk past it

00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,589
just like we do an end cap at the store

00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,700
because we know the aisle of the product

00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:25,200
that we want to buy but Drupal has a

00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,469
great dashboard and you can leverage

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,999
that you can make a lot of those those

00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:31,829
custom views you can make those little

00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:33,690
to-do lists all those things you can

00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:42,420
have right on the landing page of the

00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:44,219
admin this one dates more back to d7 but

00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,890
make sure you've got a good decent admin

00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,089
menu in there you know d7 made you kind

00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,769
of click your way all the way through

00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:52,559
the hierarchy which is kind of

00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:54,210
needlessly painful and there's several

00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,839
options out there you know da it's nav

00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:00,599
bar is great there's a back port to d7

00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:01,829
at minimal has one as well but the

00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,359
important thing is that you reduce the

00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:04,650
number of clicks that it takes for the

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,849
users to get to where they want to go

00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:11,329
and don't be afraid to try another theme

00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,319
in the admin this is can be a quick win

00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:14,070
you know make sure you get one that's

00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:17,130
that's

00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:20,370
cific Lee developed to be an admin theme

00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:23,190
like it minimal here you know the

00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,690
alternate themes the outside of the ones

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,070
that come with core you know they're

00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,810
generally going to provide a stronger

00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,750
visual aesthetic to the admin interface

00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:32,760
then you're you know it's probably going

00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,240
to be a much more contemporary style

00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,440
design but do be warned however you know

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,000
a lot of the ones we've tinkered with it

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,070
metal toad we found you know they're not

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,730
quite as battle-hardened as the

00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,980
out-of-the-box admins themes they tend

00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,330
to handle you know core very well but

00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,850
sometimes you know you'll you'll run

00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:55,020
into some conflicts on config module you

00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:56,280
know can contribute in fig areas so just

00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,410
going to be aware like the more off the

00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,820
beaten path you go the less you know the

00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:02,030
less downloads you're seeing the less

00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,350
commits less activity on an admin theme

00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:08,880
the higher the likelihood you're going

00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:10,380
to need to make a few patches when

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,570
appropriate when the client's needs dick

00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,070
take it dictate it you know there's some

00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,680
powerful tools to take the content

00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:19,290
administration right into the front end

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:21,030
d8 obviously does this brilliantly you

00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,530
know some people love the idea about

00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,940
being able to browse around the site and

00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:30,270
just click on something and edit it

00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:32,700
right there no confusion but make sure

00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:35,100
it's a good fit for them so a few years

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,900
back I spent what in hindsight was way

00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,580
way too long making sure that some

00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,340
custom features for a client we're all

00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:46,230
fully functional in the in-place editor

00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:48,240
I pretty much blew my budget for that

00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,850
and that really translated to my own

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,660
nights and weekends being not as awesome

00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:57,240
as they could have been three years

00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,250
later this particular client has still

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,190
yet to actually use any of that stuff I

00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,440
built because they just aren't that type

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,570
of client and I didn't know that you

00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,590
know I was a requirement that it had to

00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:13,080
do this and it just got done and they

00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:16,170
they just they don't browse the site and

00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,870
edit that's not their style however on

00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:20,940
the flip side you know I found on many

00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:24,390
occasions you know what I'm talking to

00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:27,420
potential clients and customers putting

00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,470
together a quick panoply demo that can

00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,750
generate

00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:32,160
massive amount of excitement you know

00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,380
there's some people when you show them

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,040
that power to just click and change the

00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,770
layout and and just drag and drop pains

00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,859
around I mean they get so excited to buy

00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:45,330
that and I was very excited to see in

00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:47,490
the keynote this morning you know some

00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,290
of the stuff that juries was proposing I

00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:54,240
mean I I have several clients that we

00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:55,650
would drool over those things but then

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,540
there's the polar opposite you know the

00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:01,650
brows and edit mentality the spreadsheet

00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:06,599
editors and if you have a client out

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:09,060
there that uses excel a lot because it's

00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:11,070
incredibly flexible you know anyone can

00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:14,010
go into Excel and manipulate data

00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:17,040
columns rows they can it's anyone can do

00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:19,560
it and sometimes the benefits of that

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:28,050
outweigh you know having that single

00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:30,960
source of truth with their data these

00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,760
people if you go to them and tell them

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,130
they need to browse around a website and

00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,359
click on things to edit them in their

00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:40,099
minds they're going to think you just

00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:40,099
made my job take a hundred times longer

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,849
so for those folks you know think about

00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,900
tabular style bulk editing you know as

00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:48,089
I've mentioned as we were talking

00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,859
earlier you know under the the content

00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:52,500
management profiles your look into

00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:55,109
things like vbo use use bulk operations

00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,080
look into some of that stuff Commerce

00:47:55,109 --> 00:48:00,060
guys have been doing but overall I think

00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,940
Drupal still has a long way to go to

00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,680
make these folks happy I'm going to be

00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,900
very interested to see how things evolve

00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,570
in Drupal as it continues to go deeper

00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,680
into the enterprise space and I think

00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,170
triple is getting really close to

00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,930
solving a lot of the the you know

00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:17,070
content authoring experience of of the

00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,080
folks that want to do the front end

00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:20,460
stuff I mean there's we're going to

00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,099
reach a point here very soon where

00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,240
drupal is nailed that and then I think

00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:29,070
we're going to start to have to make

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,300
some of these folks happy so I don't

00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,950
really don't like to do this because I

00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,060
because I feel like maintaining lists of

00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:38,910
modules is is very difficult and it's

00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:40,230
going to change next month anyway but I

00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,640
want to give a quick nod as the hard

00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,999
work some of the people that have

00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,099
contributed

00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:46,529
these modules and i'll be uploading

00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:50,129
these after if it's not worry if you

00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:52,139
miss a few but a filled group fill

00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:56,509
collection filled validation media

00:48:52,139 --> 00:49:00,599
rabbit hole revision workflow jammer

00:48:56,509 --> 00:49:03,649
link it login toboggan draggable views

00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:07,129
entity queue in line entity form

00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:10,469
shortcuts parole chosen add another

00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:13,769
custom contextual links responsive theme

00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:16,649
preview WYSIWYG usually with the

00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:21,079
ckeditor library administration views

00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:24,299
navbar at minimal menu link checker

00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:27,479
pathologic content menu plupload and

00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:29,339
bootstrap tour these are just some of

00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:32,459
the ones that we've been favoring at

00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:36,479
metal toad for some projects not all but

00:49:32,459 --> 00:49:39,109
some but this is great but how does this

00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:41,819
become a reality within your business

00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:43,619
because that's be blunt all this stuff i

00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:46,169
talked about can be very difficult to

00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:49,379
justify to your clients and getting them

00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:51,679
to pay for it fact is it's typically

00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:54,419
considered to be a much lower priority

00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:56,999
so unless the main focus of the project

00:49:54,419 --> 00:49:58,979
is a portal specifically meant for the

00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:00,479
creation of content odds are you've got

00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:03,839
a public facing front end that's going

00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:06,569
to hog all the priority and when the

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:09,179
Iron Triangle gets strained d prior d

00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:11,849
prioritization of the admin section is a

00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:14,999
very easy release valve valve for all

00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:16,559
that pressure as recently having a

00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:18,119
casual conversation with the director

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,699
development for a large hardware

00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,979
manufacturing company she was relating

00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:24,389
to me the struggles of the internal

00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:26,909
stakeholders you know trying to get them

00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:30,539
to buy into the importance of a one

00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:34,349
particular UX improvement she felt that

00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:37,409
they could literally save from a from a

00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:39,479
three minute process she felt that it

00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:43,019
was completely feasible to get that down

00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:44,969
to 30 seconds all they had to do is

00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:48,239
invest in a couple more Sprint's of

00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:52,909
development now if you just think of the

00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:55,890
long-term savings over several years of

00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:58,260
taking that 2.5 minute

00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:00,390
off of every widget coming off the

00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,480
assembly line for a fortune 100

00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,920
companies manufacturing process we're

00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,839
not even talking about millions of

00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,119
dollars in savings she was actually

00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:13,069
talking about billions of dollars in

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:16,980
savings but people can be short-sighted

00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:18,569
it seems absurd that with the cost of

00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,339
two to three Sprint's right now being

00:51:18,569 --> 00:51:22,440
able to save that much money over time

00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:25,589
that that was not just instantly

00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:29,970
approved but such as the way of business

00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:31,619
sometimes but that is turning around and

00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,539
we can all take comfort in the there is

00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,059
a movement gaining steam around this

00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:38,220
argument that it is worth putting some

00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:44,549
time and money into making these

00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:46,589
improvements some practical tips change

00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:49,160
your mindset when estimating to include

00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:52,410
time for the advent of each feature I

00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,579
think we all think about the feature we

00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,650
all think about what it's going to do

00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,390
but we got to remember part of the life

00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,130
cycle of that piece of information of

00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:03,380
that feature is the information getting

00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:03,380
in there and we got to build that to

00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:07,890
actively account for this time when

00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,299
you're writing your scopes of work you

00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,430
know this should be this should be

00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:15,000
represented as dollars as part of the

00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:16,680
budget and do not wait to the end of the

00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,779
project if you wait to the end of the

00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,009
project you're not going to do it plain

00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:21,450
and simple you're not going to take the

00:52:20,009 --> 00:52:26,069
time because something else is going to

00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:27,839
take the priority so make the admin

00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:31,140
improvement subtasks you know for each

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:34,319
story that you're working on part of

00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:37,140
acceptance should be that it's easy to

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:39,480
administer and whatever context whatever

00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,950
flows with with making it easy to

00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:46,170
administer should be part of acceptance

00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:47,700
criteria show off the progress in your

00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:49,710
demos to your clients when you're doing

00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,079
sprint review show them the full

00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:54,150
lifecycle from creating the content all

00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,920
the way up until it's displayed so they

00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,079
can picture in their minds and their

00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,910
thinking of this is part of what they're

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:05,910
buying talk to them about the entire

00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:07,380
life cycle of the project now it's one

00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:09,210
thing if you're doing a quick small

00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,220
website for

00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:13,290
an event you know it may last for a few

00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,610
months and it might be end of life but

00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,500
if what you're talking to your client

00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:20,190
about is going to be expected to be

00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,570
around and used for several years start

00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,030
talking to them about things like

00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:25,260
employee turnover you know how hard do

00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:28,520
they want it to be to train new

00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:32,400
employees over the next several years

00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:34,950
and don't just tell them about it show

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,990
it to them you know I talked about the

00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,640
emphasis of getting a demo but you got

00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,440
to give as well I mean you got to show

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,580
them how much easier you're making

00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,910
things for them establish an accompany

00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:49,290
an actual awareness within your company

00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:53,990
empower your employees to cultivate

00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:56,430
empathy towards the stakeholders needs

00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:59,070
you know have some standards around

00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:00,480
admin experience you know have your team

00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:03,240
wanting to strive for reaching those

00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,820
standards always plan to implement a

00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:09,000
bare minimum I mean at least even for a

00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:11,610
small teeny tiny you know five page site

00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,440
at least spend two to four hours to do

00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:16,470
some configuration changing unit fits

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,210
just roles and permissions and a little

00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:22,680
bit of touching up with the content of

00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:25,440
you so you know have a minimum effort

00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,300
and then hopefully ask yourself

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,690
shouldn't you do a little bit more than

00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,250
the bare minimum for your clients one

00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:33,630
easy way to establish a bare minimum is

00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:36,390
to create and maintain a company

00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:38,010
installation profile you know this way

00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,960
every time you break ground on a new

00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,760
site you know you're already kind of

00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,990
able to bake in a lot of your company's

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,280
default opinions and best practices you

00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,690
know metal toad we kind of go on a step

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,400
further you know we even have a small

00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,650
little shell script that we use it goes

00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,110
off sets up environments sets up the git

00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,060
repo deployment processes you know it

00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:59,940
sets up Drupal based on our installation

00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:02,430
profile so literally in seconds we go

00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,590
from absolutely nothing to development

00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:08,280
ready with our company baseline opinions

00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,720
already baked in now yeah we still got

00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,690
to do a lot of work and all those

00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,190
questions we asked and an evaluation we

00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,490
did of our customers are going to make

00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,560
us have we still have work to do to

00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:21,630
custom and Taylor eyes Taylor the admin

00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,510
experience but we've at least got a huge

00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,710
head start

00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:27,539
and if you tend to work with multiple

00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:29,970
you know like clients in multiple

00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:31,319
industries specific industries it might

00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,819
not be a bad idea to make a couple of

00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:36,750
these just so you can kind of spin up

00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:38,279
different ones very rapidly and of

00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,380
course like any anything in our industry

00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:43,349
the second you stop moving is the second

00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:45,690
second that your outdated continually

00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:48,660
reevaluate and modify your company's

00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:49,950
opinions around admin UX and check in

00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,990
with stakeholders a few months after

00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:55,289
launch and ask them if they've got any

00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:58,500
pain points retro with them learn from

00:55:55,289 --> 00:56:01,710
the ones you've done in the past so to

00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:04,980
sum it all up if you've done your

00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,839
homework on your applicable people if

00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,400
you've done your method acting and

00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:13,140
you've put yourself in their shoes the

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:17,609
most important part of all of this is

00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:22,140
you have to ask yourself would I want to

00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:24,990
use this what would be frustrating to

00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:28,200
you what would you feel to be

00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:31,710
repetitious what would cause you to

00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,480
think at the end of a workday man you

00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:36,539
know if that was just automated I could

00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,819
have been out of here hours ago then

00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:42,480
channel your inner content author and

00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:44,609
ask how can I make this easier how can I

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,000
make it better and then go and actually

00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,000
do it

00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:58,430
always remember Drupal provides all the

00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:02,570
tools to create rich content management

00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:06,470
experiences it's up to us to use those

00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:12,260
tools and it's up to us to empower the

00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:18,500
people and to empower the people we need

00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:28,700
to think like the people all right shall

00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:30,140
we have a little Q&A I've i think i'm

00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,290
supposed to mention join us for sprints

00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:35,740

00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,740
