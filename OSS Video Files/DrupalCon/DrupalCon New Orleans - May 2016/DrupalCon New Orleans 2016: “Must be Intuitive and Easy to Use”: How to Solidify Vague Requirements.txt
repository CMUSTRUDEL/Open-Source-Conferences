Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: “Must be Intuitive and Easy to Use”: How to Solidify Vague Requirements
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	This session explores how to shepherd a project with very fuzzy requirements into a well-scoped actionable project plan. 

We’ve all received that RFP from a prominent organization filled with adjectives and buzzwords… “The new site must be ‘engaging’ and ‘inviting’ and ‘interactive’!"

Every web project begins with some sort of requirements gathering processes. Sometimes it’s done by a technical team, sometimes by a business strategist or marketing department. Needs typically seem straightforward to the people closest to the project because of personal pain points they’ve experienced.  Many stakeholders will talk about how very obvious the need for improvement is without referencing specifics from the user's point of view.

“Requirements are initiated by senior managers and company executives as policies, aims, objectives and other high-level statements of intent. This necessitates considerable scoping activity as requirements start with vaguely expressed intentions and users’ wish lists...”
~ Usability in Government Systems: User Experience Design for Citizens and Public Servants by Elizabeth Buie & Dianne Murray

When stakeholders come from a variety of backgrounds and multidisciplinary groups, submitted requirements documentation can be varied and inconsistent - from a 30 thousand foot view, to incredibly granular, often with a focus on a few key features combined with sweeping high-level passes at others.

Typical requirements gathering activities are business analysis, stakeholder interviews, reverse engineering current systems, wireframing and brainstorming with a goal to identify project objectives and limitations, identifying critical success factors, and defining project deliverables. However, because user involvement is one of the greatest challenges in requirements identification, a different approach (originally from Suzanne Robertson), describes how there are actually three distinct categories of requirements:

Conscious Requirements - Problems that the new system must solve.
Unconscious Requirements - Issues already adequately addressed by the current system, and important not to overlook
Undreamed of Requirements - Items that would be considered important if it was known they were possible or if they were better understood
This presentation will introduce the concept of 'Undreamt Requirements Analysis'.
The following UX problems will be addressed: 

Users cannot always articulate what they truly want or need
Users do not have the necessary technology background and expertise to ask the right questions
Users cannot be expected to provide reasonable answers
Users only know what they have experienced
Users are not committed to the product
Users do not have the incentive to think hard about the problems (or solutions)

	00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,660
this is a session about requirements

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,679
gathering which sounds exceedingly

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,269
boring until I made up a catchy title

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,880
and look at you you're all here which is

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,859
amazing thank you for coming the agenda

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,369
today is pretty simple if you've read

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,840
through the abstract and it's just a

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,510
little bit about how challenging it is

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,949
to gather requirements and then some

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,579
things that I've learned along the way

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:36,120
so I have been working in Drupal for 10

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,190
years various hats in information

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,450
architecture user experience and project

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,370
management and with some some kind of

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,440
capacity doing a requirements gathering

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,390
exercise with every single project that

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,649
I've worked on and the one thing that

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,770
I've learned through this is it it's

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,710
it's extremely hard it's extremely hard

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,730
and it it's something that can only be

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,129
successful if you're using

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,989
multidisciplinary teams and you have

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:05,309
everybody invested in it so I would like

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,960
to know who you are how many of you work

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,580
in Drupal consider themselves Drupal

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:16,290
professionals fabulous okay how many of

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:20,280
you are technical great how many you are

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,610
creative nice how many of you work with

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,619
content so a lot of people wearing a lot

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,619
of hats here as well okay that's great

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,650
and why are you interested in this topic

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,290
I know why I'm interested in this topic

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:42,540
because I have felt the pain because

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:45,360
I've had projects where we thought we

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,460
knew everything and we didn't and and

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,229
you know you find yourself asking why

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,079
didn't just tell me just tell me what

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,950
you want and then we can do it but they

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,780
don't know they they don't know so some

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,790
of the things that I've been learning in

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,130
the past several years I've put together

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,799
put into a presentation and one of the

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,209
most like mind-blowing things that I

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,830
learned was this concept of conscious

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,330
requirements unconscious requirements

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,460
and under mped

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,770
requirements and that's what I'd like to

00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,240
describe today what those are what the

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,830
challenge is and how to go about

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,590
uncovering some of them so what I'm

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,380
talking about is typically three

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,030
different scenarios you have a redesign

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,560
where it's pretty fresh refresh upgrade

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,200
there's a couple things you want to do

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,160
things to move out things to move in but

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,000
there's something there to talk about

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,620
there's either a Drupal site or there's

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,570
some sort of legacy system or there's

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,610
something approximating a site of some

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,040
kind with pages there's something to

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,570
look at then number two is brand-new I'm

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,220
going to spend less time here because I

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,650
have a feeling that most of you are

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,690
looking at number one and number three

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,310
and number three is kind of the most

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,260
terrifying thing and that's like the

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,690
rescue project the we built it and then

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,280
it didn't quite work out and then we

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,410
didn't get along with our team anymore

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,510
and now we either have to fix it or

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,800
rebuild it or start over again how many

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,610
of you have been in that situation on

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,459
either side right okay so you know this

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,680
this kind of stuff happens and then the

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,239
more I looked into it they kept calling

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,040
requirements guys with gathering an

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,769
emerging field which is strange because

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,190
we've been building things for a long

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,840
time that have requirements of all kinds

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,500
but this is something that we're

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,709
notoriously bad at for all kinds of

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,320
reasons one of the challenges that we

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,830
face is that sometimes we're trying to

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,420
map 1214 a customer requirement or a

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,890
stakeholder requirement and somebody

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,610
makes a request and it becomes a feature

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,070
or there's an there's an input and we

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,670
put a checkbox next to it or we get

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,739
caught in two high level or two granular

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,760
and one of the things that I want to

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,810
propose is there must be balanced and

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,750
there are so many different kinds of

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,450
people that have their own way of seeing

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,739
things that how do we everybody how do

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,580
we get everybody on the same page and

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,250
certainly when they come from different

00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,919
backgrounds you have the added problem

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,950
of the the materials that you're getting

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:29,930
from various teams are going to be so

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:33,810
friend and so what's the word

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,090
inconsistent all kinds of things super

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,060
super granular too crazy high level and

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,030
everything in between so much

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,820
documentation that it seems as though we

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,770
have enough if I have a hundred pages

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,550
there's gotta be enough to build this

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,930
thing because there's a hundred pages I

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,940
don't need another page first I don't

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,670
want to read a hundred pages but if I do

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,230
I should be able to build it that's the

00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,670
that's that that's the concept that I

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,770
think we're coming from we just tell

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,020
them like just throw everything at you

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,120
and you should be the build this but we

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,710
forget where does it come from and who

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,750
creates it and what's the language and

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,270
there's so many little sticky things and

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,350
you imagine that if you take one degree

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,180
of a variation off of the direction the

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,910
path we're going to go eventually you're

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,140
going to be really far off further down

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,860
the project hopefully when you've been

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,970
moved to a different project so this is

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,140
the kind of stuff we're getting you know

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,760
we're looking through the proposal and

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,410
the wireframes and the Photoshop files

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,450
and spreadsheets and the user stories

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,710
and we're just like trying to break our

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,840
heads and come up with some sort of

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,230
unified plan forward what it is we're

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,540
actually building and traditional stuff

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,650
is is is very dry right it's going to be

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,870
Thursday's constraints and conditions

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,790
and there's systems and and and and a

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,830
lot of technical people bring amazing

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,390
documentation I am a spreadsheet queen

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,380
not really i'm actually been called that

00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:01,260
and i love i love detailed stuff but

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,540
there must be balanced this is what it

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,780
looks like we've got like super crazy

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,220
high level stuff to incredibly granular

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,460
and it all kind of looks the same in the

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,930
end because they're coming from

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,180
different backgrounds they're showing us

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,710
different things and not one person is

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,590
going to be able to understand

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,910
everything from every point of view so

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,650
how does this come together in a melting

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,470
pot well i'm going to talk a little bit

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,890
more about the actual problem you have

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,230
this 30,000 foot view and a few key

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,940
features that have been really fleshed

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,770
out pretty amazing features because

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,410
somebody spent the time because that was

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,970
their baby so but that's not the whole

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,810
site right then we've got a situation

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,450
where we

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,830
really know what the priority is I like

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,730
this picture I don't know if it's real

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,110
but I like it the wrong focus right they

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,840
bring you a project and they're just got

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,780
like three pages on one feature and a

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,570
little paragraph on 14 other features so

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:03,150
i would think big paragraph main

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:07,530
priority not always right you can be

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:12,800
precise without being accurate you can

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:15,419
be precise without being accurate

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,150
precision gives you the illusion of

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:20,430
accuracy and completeness because it's

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,830
right every little that's a real F and

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,500
that is an S and that's an eye and you

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,500
can still read it but it's not accurate

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,960
so balanced what does that actually look

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,340
like I have a goal to first I got to

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,160
understand what language you're speaking

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,750
what have you brought me I have fill in

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,940
the gaps I got to figure out is it high

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,440
level is it low level well what do you

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,330
think it is cuz that's a big deal if

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,710
you've given me if you've given me

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,280
something that you think is high level

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,020
and its really very granular there's a

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,220
disconnect and there's something that we

00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:02,580
need to talk about so the very first

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,680
objection you will have but they're just

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,120
like if we say no this isn't we need to

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,919
do and there's discovery and we're going

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,970
to spare time and money and you have a

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,639
deadline that they're just going to go

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,470
to someone else yes they will some of

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,740
them will and they will be back with a

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:20,630
rescue project because they couldn't

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,039
build it so you need to ask yourself are

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,990
you trying to win an argument or you

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,669
trying to win the war because if you

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,580
build what was asked for but what not

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:31,080
what was needed you're going to be the

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,190
people they're leaving to go to someone

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:40,770
else too in many cases I think we should

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:43,320
all band together and do this thing so

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,300
how are we going to do this we have

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,160
these conscious requirements so these

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,470
are these are the ones the no-brainers

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,910
we need an event calendar because we

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,010
have events and we need to know when

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,550
they are that's a good place to start

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,170
great

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,240
there's tons to unpack there but at

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,430
least we know what it is unconscious

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,440
requirements this is really interesting

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,260
to me because I've gone through a lot of

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,490
projects that have started off in a

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:12,329
crazy custom-built legacy system that

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,860
had all these automagically some of them

00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:16,019
are business process some of them were

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,029
made just because that was the way that

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,130
we figured out that we could make it so

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,420
they kind of force their business

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,459
processes into that because that's

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,100
what's the tool and we had to try to

00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,320
figure out the difference and then

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,200
there's these undreamt requirements

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,850
things that they would love to be able

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
to do if we would know about them and

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,339
they don't know to ask and I don't know

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,860
how to ask because I don't know what

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:40,440
that it's actually there or not but the

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,980
way for it's pretty subtle they can't

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,600
always articulate what they want they

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,120
may not answer in the st. in the way

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,589
that we asked them to answer they only

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,640
know what they've experienced and

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,990
they're not going to be experiencing

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,630
things that you've experienced because

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,240
they're coming from subject matter

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,640
expertise domain expertise their

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:07,950
business and we're coming from tool

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:10,649
expertise we know how to build stuff but

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,630
this is the place where we can provide

00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:15,060
the most value you will be a rock star

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:18,120
this is the place where there is the

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,430
potential to really really knock it out

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,490
of the park like the kind of pride that

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,930
you come home and all those horrible

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,170
14-hour days you're like but I built

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:31,560
this thing and they loved it this is

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:36,480
mining for gold and this is a slide from

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,029
jareds pools keynote hmm 2011 I love it

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,399
though because it kind of shows like we

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,790
have we have process and product

00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,860
knowledge of our of our tools of our

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,079
system of what we can build they've got

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,120
knowledge of their current system they

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,470
have knowledge of their business and we

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:59,430
need to all kind of get in the same

00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:01,589
place so this process focuses on what

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,660
I've highlighted there so this might be

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:07,520
a typical requirements gathering process

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,320
so you have your offered a request this

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,820
is what we would like there's some

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,640
information gathering there's some

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,680
analysis modeling validation is an

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,950
important one and then towards the end

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,820
there's something the salespeople do I'm

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:25,550
not going to cover that part I kind of

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,040
think of it as like what kind of

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:35,480
requirement are you I mean do a quiz do

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:38,420
you like purple are you high level do

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,600
you have visuals is there a diagram

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,210
involved there somewhere they're gonna

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,340
land in there right there gonna be like

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,950
super big picture really granular but

00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,720
here's what to remember abstracts the

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,850
big picture stuff that's what's going to

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,890
give you the patterns the patterns that

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,840
make you make something that's going to

00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,240
be efficient that's going to help you

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:03,770
hit budget that's going to be modular

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,630
that's going to be scalable but there's

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,560
the except when we do this thing and

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,330
then we have it like this but on

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,380
Thursdays and then Nancy comes in but

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,460
she does it a completely different way

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,080
but we told you to support her because

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:17,750
she's really awesome she's been here so

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:24,560
long yeah so specifics give you outliers

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:26,210
and outliers cost a lot of money but we

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,010
want to find the middle way we want to

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,530
find the middle ways so conscious

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,510
high-level requirements loaded words

00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,950
like you want to build an online

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,820
community or a membership portal or

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,100
eventually we're going to do content

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,440
personalization I mean these are so big

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,390
so big that they're their own project

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,370
pretty much some of the time and this

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,840
like automagically that well it was

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,760
going to appear on the page but it you

00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,260
know in this page is about swimming

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,940
pools so all the swimming pool stuff

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,830
will appear here but we don't actually

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,730
have the ia to support any of that yet

00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,990
so typically just request without a good

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,720
understanding what it is but you can

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,290
understand where they're going with it

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,640
very vague usually kind of loaded

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,350
granular conscious requirements are

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,100
things like layout specifications

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:16,310
without really having any I a done or

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,570
very specific content creation form

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,950
requirements without actually knowing

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:23,640
Drupal

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,950
or request for very specific modules

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,750
that maybe somebody told them were good

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,130
for some other site that have nothing to

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,880
do with their site but they just like

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,320
this is a good one you need this one and

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,660
then some content editing screens I've

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,580
seen described to the very last label

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,500
and button so this is the kind of

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,810
granular stuff that is conscious they've

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,620
asked for it but really needs a lot of

00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:48,720
pushback the most challenging for me

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:54,920
personally as an analytical person is

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,920
this type of request where do you begin

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,950
but I found a way we need to begin

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,899
unpacking requirements with some

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,279
business insight with some content

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,230
strategy and with some information

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,390
architecture and when I see something

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:15,540
like this I know where to begin now

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:18,360
because I start with a big picture what

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,899
ask what does this actually do what do

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,980
you do and somewhere in there is the

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,820
site that you're building there's

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,680
something combination of those but you

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,510
can probably figure okay so this is what

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,950
what it is this is what the purpose of

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:37,050
the site is awesome so this engaging

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,180
thing that it needs to do well we have

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,520
digital analytics for that we have

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,790
metrics very well-thought-out metrics

00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,180
and metrics I don't metrics different

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,350
than data the analysis part is going to

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,150
be totally different than the report

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,040
that says all the percentages so

00:14:51,150 --> 00:15:00,089
actually deciding what you're going to

00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:01,440
monitor is another session um and then

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,050
we can go into the unconscious and these

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,520
are often assumptions about things and

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,350
you can tell because they have certain

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,770
ways referring to them they'll say

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,620
things like widget or plug-in or feed

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:17,279
and it could mean so many different

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,070
things they've mentioned responsive is a

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,620
priority their current site is not

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,410
responsive but they also have 16

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,170
different layout possibilities red flag

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,370
right there's things that are

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,630
contradictory in many of these

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,630
unconscious requirements

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:38,770
often where the CMS begins and ends is

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,940
an unconscious requirement because

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,310
sometimes if they're coming from a

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,820
legacy system it has something else on

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:48,130
it it's got some sort of ERP or CRM or

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,870
XYZ and it just kind of because I'm

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:54,310
Canadian that's why I say it and and

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,990
those things are very important to

00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,670
figure out because it's often something

00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,050
in somebody's head that oh yeah well

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,970
that's it used to and then there was a

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,890
line there but we've moved the wall and

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,279
we're building it something else so

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:08,200
sometimes you get into this trap of just

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,700
I don't just tell me what it does and

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,230
then I'll tell you what it happens

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,140
resist this because then there's also

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,380
this you do it the same way but in the

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,330
opposite direction because then you end

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,330
up with like describing what's in the

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:25,420
Hat this thing and then we put things

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,100
and then it comes out and thaw and it is

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,390
nothing to do what they actually need

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,950
they're just trying to recreate

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,850
something they have without actually

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,800
knowing what the possibilities are so

00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,390
I'm sure you've heard it before to focus

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:43,029
on the desired outcome we're focusing on

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,459
the unstated problem not on the stated

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,630
solution so this is a lot of the time

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:49,810
you're going to get requirements that

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:52,510
are solution-based they've already

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,640
decided what it is they need and that's

00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,440
where this sort of uncomfortable thing

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,700
happens when you're not really wanting

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,250
to have that conversation about well why

00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,530
is this what you thought that didn't

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,209
sound what what makes you know that

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,030
doesn't sound right either like it's a

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,490
hard conversation to have but I think

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,809
it's worth it and I think with practice

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,910
you can actually have these in a very

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,140
gentle and positive way and i'm going to

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,620
throw quote up there because it's

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,510
Einstein but this is kind of what we

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,910
should be doing right like let's define

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,770
the problem because I've got some great

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,209
solutions but I don't really know what

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:33,790
the problem is you've just told me that

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:38,140
you need an Events Calendar so these

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:40,870
undreamt requirements are things that no

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,280
one may know how to ask about because

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,380
they just kind of go about doing their

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,610
thing and you know it's up here for them

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,870
super close

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,760
they may totally blow your mind they

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,679
were like I can't believe no one's ever

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,240
thought of this before or they may be so

00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,679
extremely subtle but matter incredibly

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,530
to somebody you know some of those those

00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,140
editing tools or little minor changes

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,100
wow it's much easier to use now and a

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,080
lot of the time they can meet rules

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,880
tools that we already know about but we

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,059
just need to figure out what it is that

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,030
we're solving it's very subtle second

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:15,010
objection but there's not and they don't

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,270
I think but I won't know i wanted i

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,320
wanted i wanted i want to just build it

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,960
why can't just build it no my answer

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:29,080
that is well do i really want to work

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:31,620
with that person no it's it's let's just

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,580
have one more meeting and let's discuss

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,250
then with just a few more clarifying

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,860
questions and let's talk about and walk

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,850
me through because now i'm going to

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,940
throw another quote up there and this

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:45,130
was super awesome too it's it doesn't

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,750
have to be confrontational we're not

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,950
trying to point out mistakes we're not

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,910
like I'm going about your business and

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,580
I'll not get better because I know

00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,780
nothing about your business no just like

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,250
you know kind of walk me through your

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,210
day what are you doing what's really

00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:00,220
hard right now okay what's easy what do

00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,380
you do on paper like you sticky notes

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,960
attached to your get what do they say it

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,340
is there like a cheat sheet for your for

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,740
your for your content creation process

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,059
what's on it and we're just we're just

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,280
not we're not trying to run their

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:17,770
business we're just trying to figure out

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,500
what's in their head so here's a few

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,240
techniques that I think it can be

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,470
extremely helpful and I'm grouping

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,169
together end users administrative users

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,700
stakeholders on the periphery I'm just

00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,740
grouping them all together because in

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,559
the end we're kind of using the same

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,559
technique on all of them in context

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,430
so abstraction abstraction can be very

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,880
difficult for some people technical

00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:51,420
people find this easier because your job

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,760
is to write some logic about something

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:59,170
but most people that are non technical

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,700
find abstraction extremely confusing so

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,610
they will come to you if you're they're

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,290
going to describe this is a camera and I

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,060
really like how it works and I push this

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,250
button and it takes a picture they've

00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:13,530
described their camera and what they do

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:18,100
to take a picture if we abstract that as

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:19,840
a technical team we might say the user

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,030
needs a mechanism in order to take a

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,860
picture because the button may not be

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,520
you know it might not be the right thing

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:30,790
anymore and and that is incredibly

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,290
valuable way of just uncoupling those

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,300
assumptions that have already been made

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,730
about something because we're already

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:42,550
jumping to the button might not be a

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:44,860
button this the diagramming can be all

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:48,460
kinds of things the fishbone diagram

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,960
mental mapping content grouping anything

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,090
that makes sense to the people in the

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,620
room I think it's fair game and then you

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,250
can start or look for patterns because

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,600
remember abstraction gives you patterns

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,270
that gives you better information

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,320
architecture better usability better

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:09,040
scalability cheaper than specific

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:12,370
outliers then there's apprentice thing

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:15,880
and interviewing this is just basically

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,680
the demo this is the screen share show

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,560
me your system walk me through what

00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,930
you're doing because there's guaranteed

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,610
to be that thing they do where you're

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,700
like Kate just can you just do that

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,990
again why why are you cutting and then

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,880
pasting and they go in the next page and

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,190
then opening and what I don't understand

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,890
why are you doing that because there's a

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,000
problem to solve there too they've done

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,470
it that way because they've always done

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,610
it that way or there's something or

00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,410
missing there's something that happens

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,540
in between and there's a lot of stuff

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,040
where there's a dovetail with a real

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,870
world there's something that happens

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,370
over here in the office beside my

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,860
computer that has nothing to do with the

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,390
system but maybe it could be part of the

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,460
system like maybe I go over there

00:21:52,390 --> 00:22:01,510
nine in the file and I pull it out and

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:03,340
then I type it in there's gold there I'm

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,800
imagining like in the past there was a

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,930
demo of a legacy system that i was

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,090
watching and there was this complicated

00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,590
procedure for for creating a report and

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,330
then pulling the emails off a report and

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,640
then cutting and pasting emails into an

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,960
email that and then making a news site

00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,150
and the whole thing was just like is

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:27,100
that an email list yes yes it is ah we

00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:28,900
can build that a different way and then

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,520
there's business events and this is a

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,740
really really interesting one because a

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,840
lot of the time I work remotely and it's

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,330
hard sometimes to to get people to

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,800
describe their business events and

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,120
activities during the day when it's

00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,650
remote because you can't follow them

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,540
around and go hey what is that what are

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,560
you doing over there but I had a really

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:49,360
interesting project for a bookstore

00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,340
where they had an online ordering system

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,800
and I was there with the lady who was

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,540
fulfilling orders and she's like oh this

00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,240
is awesome this is a super amazing

00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,310
system we really need to keep this as it

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,690
is which is that's fine it was fair but

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,460
there was one thing about it that was a

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,650
little awkward that she didn't notice

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,170
because they had interns come in and go

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,150
and pack the books up they go to the

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,980
shelf and bind the book and put it in a

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:16,300
box and pack them so they get the order

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,580
and then they had to look and see what

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,870
the Shelf code was for the book so they

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,430
take the order and they look at the book

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,640
and then they go into their other system

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:27,550
and look up the Shelf code why not print

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,980
the Shelf code on the order or in the

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,200
system where I can see it why have this

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,910
extra additional step and this is the

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,890
undreamt stuff nobody figured that that

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,900
would be maybe a good idea to have it on

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,580
there so I got oh it's on shelf blue

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,630
squirrels so I'm going to go over there

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:47,620
I'm going to get the book i'm looking

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:50,650
for and brainstorming I think I mean a

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,660
lot of people are extremely terrified of

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:56,020
brainstorming because what if they think

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,600
up a bunch of stuff that they want and

00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:01,420
then they think it's included because we

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,900
talked about it briefly in a meeting and

00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,740
now we're going to get it no there are

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,650
thing

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:13,320
things you can do to brainstorm safely

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,570
where you keep the creativity contained

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,610
where you open up the box and not let

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,620
everything fly out at people's faces and

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,110
it's not that messy and it's great for

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,730
new products I'd say I wasn't going to

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,020
mention the nude product so much but

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,429
brainstorming is great if it's something

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,559
that doesn't exist if we're not sure

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:31,690
what it does I love doing research and

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,280
seeing what's existing what is it like

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,250
people are always like really super

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,150
obsessed with their vertical yes but is

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,890
it exactly the same as my product no but

00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,660
the process is the same and the

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,640
interface is the same and demographics

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,500
the same and so we take it from here and

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,120
here and here and and this at least gets

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,770
us a little bit further we don't need to

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,780
reinvent the wheel we can stand on the

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:58,510
shoulders of giants as my friend and

00:24:52,780 --> 00:25:02,140
likes to say and mind mapping these are

00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:04,150
for visual people and I say this because

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,790
sometimes i like being creative and

00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:10,480
sometimes i don't but there are so many

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:13,000
people out there that love to just draw

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,710
it out and nobody is ever going to hand

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,650
you that well actually did happen once

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,970
thing in as a requirement we did this on

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,950
the whiteboard and we're including it

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,860
it's a sketch of what the new system

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,450
should be but it's great i mean just get

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,130
started let's have the conversation

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,960
let's have a conversation because we

00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,620
need to find the middle path we need to

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,750
find the way a simulation model and

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,059
there's no I can see that would be very

00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,240
expensive and look we don't have the to

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:42,130
this can really just be your wire frames

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,590
and making them clickable or this can

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,630
just be you know just look at some

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,950
screenshots of similar Drupal sites the

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,960
back end it like it'll be a little bit

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,790
like this except then be your

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,160
information here and then you'll go here

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,050
and you can make a prototype and i'm not

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,780
talking about something fancy you can

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,220
make an approximation of what

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,620
something's going to look like and if

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,580
you want to invest in some templates for

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,470
a registration workflow for a product

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,910
purchase workflow those are really

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,460
valuable because we know what this stuff

00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,990
looks like but often our stakeholders or

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,120
our clients don't and if we just show

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,770
them vanilla a lot of the time it's all

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,549
right but it also gives us the

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,700
opportunity to discuss things that main

00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:23,960
not be exactly as they need and all of a

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,059
sudden we've seen it on a piece of paper

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,769
and like well but we don't do that with

00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,119
our credit cards in it there and now

00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:32,869
we've had the conversation before we've

00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:36,289
built it so prototypes doesn't doesn't

00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:40,929
have to be scary so what are we looking

00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:43,700
for we are looking for the big picture

00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:47,149
we're looking for relationships so the

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,850
big picture to me is what is this aight

00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:53,029
do what is this business do what are the

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:56,960
users do what are we expecting from

00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:58,429
people when they arrive and then the

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,320
relationships are really important

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:02,509
because some of the time if you just get

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,509
a sitemap if you just get some designs

00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:07,519
or a wireframe or maybe even a list of

00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:10,340
content types you're not really seeing

00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,019
the relationships between things and it

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,330
doesn't have to be an entity

00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:16,009
relationship diagram it can just be that

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,769
sketch right so we've got this professor

00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:20,450
and he's got a class and you know he's

00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,609
in this room and there's a building over

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:25,249
here and just kind of show me how you

00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:28,999
imagined it to work because more often

00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:31,730
than not that natural relationship that

00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:32,840
is described in a business kind of way

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,989
like this is how it works in the real

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,779
world is actually a pretty good model

00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:40,820
for the system if it if it works like

00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:42,649
we're not going to force it but me

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,799
trying to think of relationships based

00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:48,070
on what I want to display is not as good

00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:50,299
as actually having a logical sensible

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,029
structure that's the information

00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:55,549
architecture and me speaking context is

00:27:53,029 --> 00:28:00,710
also extremely important and what I mean

00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:02,539
by that is both context of use and also

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,119
the context in which we're actually

00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:07,639
doing all this planning because you know

00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,950
if if there's this huge change coming

00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:11,480
we're going to want to plan for that as

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,070
well we're going to like what's what's

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,609
the big next big thing for everybody

00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,320
here what does the what are the future

00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:20,480
problems what does the system need to do

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,789
in the in the near future so

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,960
contextually if I'm using it I'm using

00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:28,789
the site on my phone where am I what do

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,619
I need to do is different but it's the

00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:33,260
same kind of context like what is the

00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:35,420
where am i and them in my situation

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,910
then where the business is in their

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,050
online situation because there's often

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,690
when there's a redesign there's some

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,980
huge goals and huge leaps ahead and

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,960
there's things that the system needs to

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,200
accomplish so that brings me to

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,930
priorities and reasons because priority

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,830
is going to be really hard because the

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:54,200
priorities sometimes come down to

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:57,050
personal preference of whoever wears the

00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,900
biggest hat in the room or has the

00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,510
nicest title or something but honestly

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,030
priorities need to be what makes sense

00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,440
for the organization what is their

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,790
mission and vision if you don't have

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,910
that kind of person involved in the

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:13,070
project you're in trouble because then

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,570
we're just designing it because you know

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,880
somebody's told me we need a new website

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,130
there's a list here I need to follow it

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,810
if we don't have direction then those

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,400
very very difficult decisions at the end

00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,620
when money's running low and we've got

00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,930
you know enough to build for and we

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,460
really need six and who's going to make

00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,920
that decision it needs to be on

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,130
somebody's head that has that mission

00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,930
and vision and grand scheme of things

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:39,320
overall picture yes we can do a little

00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,670
of this what are our options because the

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,920
reasons for things can be very

00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:45,260
complicated you know in Drupal it's it's

00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,760
cheap and fast to build features but it

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,740
can get really really expensive when you

00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,170
want to customize things and change

00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,660
things and have them be just so and

00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,310
that's the fight that usually happens so

00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,830
you can define some of that really

00:29:55,310 --> 00:30:00,800
really early the priorities the big

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,390
picture the the reasons for things then

00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,220
you can come back to that because it's

00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,350
one of those documents that i think

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,960
sometimes gets created a type of charter

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:10,160
and then it's like really far down and

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,360
teamwork or base camp or what have you

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,560
use and nobody ever looks at it again

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,370
and i think it should be brought out

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,750
maybe even every time you provide a PM

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,310
report we're going to look at our

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,410
priorities yet it doesn't have to be 15

00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:24,350
sentence as long it could really just be

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,090
a couple of points really got to get

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,690
this thing built really needs to be able

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:32,690
to you know sign up people so keeping

00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:35,740
that focus is going to help I think too

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:39,309
with with the build

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,260
and then I think and with it the last

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:42,460
three here assumptions constraints

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,010
boundaries this is what we're talking

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,770
about when you say scope scope is not

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:51,790
what I need scope is what I can build

00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:54,070
for you within this amount of time and

00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,420
this amount of money scope is not I'm

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,390
not going to get the thing but i need

00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,030
the thing it's like you have this much

00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,309
money and the cookie is this much and

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,050
you don't you can't buy half a cookie so

00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:07,450
what are we going to do so these

00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:09,700
conversations i think are part of

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,559
requirements gathering and I'm a really

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,200
big fan of having them conversations

00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:15,730
early roadmapping out all the things

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,070
that you can think of over the next two

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:21,640
years and then drawing the lines and

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,710
then saying okay I understand that

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,910
sometimes budgets can be managed

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,429
creatively there's plenty of

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,110
organizations out there that split

00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:31,150
between years they got to build this

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,559
they got a bill a certain way but then

00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,540
they can build stuff so all of those

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,160
conversations if you have account

00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,110
managers that can have those

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,580
conversations like how you know we're

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,410
not trying to nickel and dime you but

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,600
how can we work creatively to actually

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:48,070
build stuff with the resources that you

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,900
have available and resources I would

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,820
also include their content resources

00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:56,260
because if you're making extremely large

00:31:51,820 --> 00:32:01,330
shift with content that takes a lot of

00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:04,830
time and a lot of effort so I think

00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:06,880
validation is a piece that we skim over

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,470
we'll send them a piece of there it is

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,050
we've estimated it there's our

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,360
description and there's all the

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:15,790
discovery assets deliverables elements

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,370
sign here please and I really think that

00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:21,700
that's an opportunity to do the

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,380
validation now for stakeholders that

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,100
might be showing them high level stuff

00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,960
maybe just some specifics on the

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,809
priorities how we got to the features

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,700
some of the exercises some of the very

00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:35,170
key decisions that were made in order to

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,179
bring us to a certain point because

00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:42,370
nothing is as crappy as having some

00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,330
supervisor come down and say what you

00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,429
know what have you been doing for the

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,740
last six weeks everything's changed and

00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:49,149
not being aware of the process informed

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,849
and invest

00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:53,229
good bought in an understanding how we

00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:54,279
got to the place that now it looks

00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:57,580
completely different from what they

00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:01,359
asked for that's a really really

00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,219
difficult situation so I think with this

00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,879
validation there's many different ways

00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:08,979
of doing this but but you want to focus

00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:10,690
on the decision makers and end users

00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:12,639
sometimes in the middle those people get

00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,769
a little bit shortchanged administrators

00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:16,179
content creators but there's a lot of

00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:18,339
room there because there's things that

00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:20,700
can shift in that area I think for users

00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:23,499
and this is another session perhaps

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,559
doing some user testing navigation

00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:29,830
validation all of those exercises in the

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,799
UX realm are very valuable and showing

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,690
that information as part of the

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,889
presentation of requirements that have

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,659
been gathered we know that this is

00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:40,179
important because of this test that we

00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:42,009
did we think that this actually can be

00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:46,839
left out because no one mentioned it

00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:48,940
during our interviews and then comes the

00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,639
negotiation I means a little bit of a

00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,139
trading card exercise if you don't have

00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:54,789
the money for everything then what comes

00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:57,249
in and what goes out and what needs to

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:59,109
be changed and sometimes if you affect

00:33:57,249 --> 00:34:01,509
one thing everything else changes too

00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:02,799
and it's incredibly difficult but I

00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,940
think those are the conversations that

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:09,369
aren't being had those difficult all

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,619
stakeholders in how we got here how we

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:14,200
need to move forward conversations so

00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,579
now what I want to do with a few minutes

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,079
here is I want to leave some time for

00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:19,179
questions but I want to actually use a

00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:24,159
metaphor because I do this with work

00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:27,429
with non-technical people I want to say

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,129
okay so we're catering a meal if you

00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:33,309
just get a list of recipes or if you

00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:34,599
just get ingredients what are you going

00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:36,849
to be missing I mean there's this

00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:38,529
there's high level stuff there's pretty

00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,559
important why are we having this meal

00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:42,970
who's coming what are there any

00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,799
allergies I need to know about like

00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,440
there's there's some things that need to

00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:49,779
go into it it is not just a list of

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,740
stuff and would go to the store and I

00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:53,049
buy it and then I'm going to do the

00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:56,260
recipe and there it is no it's there's

00:34:53,049 --> 00:35:00,670
this huge eco system around it that I'm

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:03,790
trying to balance

00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:06,069
so maybe the request is prepared

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,470
informal to course dinner for four and

00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:10,980
it must have protein I'm they're

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,299
probably not meaning protein powder

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,690
right but there's there's things on

00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:19,359
earth there's things when we get a an

00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:27,609
RFP where it can be interpreted that way

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:29,680
like protein shrimp or steak not sure so

00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,059
that when we when we start to scope a

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,890
little bit we're going to we're going to

00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:35,890
apply the boundaries it's gonna be after

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,970
five guests are available this 20 we

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,410
haven't even talked about when it's

00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,510
gonna happen yet oh my gosh have you

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,069
ever had that the RFP and then their van

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,569
used it and then there's this whole big

00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:48,130
humongous thing that nobody ever talked

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:52,569
about this is why many lenses using many

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:53,530
tools and validation walkthrough so now

00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:56,619
we're going to do a little bit of fat

00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:59,200
gathering I have a shellfish allergy so

00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,760
I don't really want to be serving

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
shellfish to my guests because I would

00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,799
like to be alive for the rest of the

00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,480
dinner and I like spicy food I really

00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:09,069
like peppers this may or may not be

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,930
relevant but they've given me the

00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:13,240
information that I can now look at and

00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:15,460
say okay I think I've got something to

00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,109
work with here because this is the kind

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,440
of information that will help me figure

00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:23,140
out what and how because this is just

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,579
enough and you know obviously that you

00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,470
can get into a lot of margin with

00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:30,760
something like this I can do some

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:36,250
analysis then get into a lot more detail

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:38,950
I think I think agile is so cool and I

00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,270
think waterfalls cool too but somewhere

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:45,130
in the middle is where everything is

00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:46,510
happening and so some flexibility i find

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,030
that with with the most successful

00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:51,910
projects the flexibility is that the

00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,490
client the stakeholders the team trust

00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:58,240
each other that if a change needs to be

00:36:54,490 --> 00:37:00,609
made that we're not trying to screw each

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,670
other we're just trying to make it well

00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:07,630
working and and make a beautiful product

00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:10,390
so in the end this is what was made and

00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,950
i think i chose a name that i can't

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,430
pronounce for whatever reason how about

00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,040
that would be really clever

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:18,559
but if I got that at the very beginning

00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,079
I think that would have scared me off

00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,450
like I don't want to make that or if I

00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,859
just got a picture of ingredients at the

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,349
very beginning I don't know what I'm

00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:32,059
making I like olives maybe I'll just eat

00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:33,650
them plain and the validation is like so

00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:37,609
this is kind of what we're looking at

00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:40,520
it's going to be this might switch out

00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:43,670
the napkin you know so that matches your

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,650
branding and then at some point they

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,319
might have been thinking this and I

00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,150
might have been thinking this but we've

00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:52,819
had that conversation and when we've

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,980
gone in and actually looked at things

00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:56,660
from all kinds of directions we were

00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,230
able to realize and have a good laugh

00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,579
about it and have a bit of a trade-off

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,440
exercise well we can't do this piece

00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:06,559
anymore well what are we going to do if

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,270
this happens and the risks are something

00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,130
to start talking about the very

00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:12,109
beginning and we have some data to

00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,510
support things now we know what's

00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:16,609
important and we know because many

00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,880
people have been able to talk this

00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:23,000
through with us and inside this

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,910
negotiation that happens things will

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,369
change and I have to feel as a

00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,780
professional I have to feel like I don't

00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:32,480
do anything wrong because something

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,890
changed I did something right and I need

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,380
to be in a situation where I feel safe

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:38,089
about that and my clients and

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,470
stakeholders respect that they respect

00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:44,750
me as somebody who has experience and

00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,030
knowledge in order to come up with the

00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:50,030
best possible solution and went through

00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:51,829
another quote up there I know this was

00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,799
from long time ago but I just want to

00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:57,349
say it's the mix of these abstracts and

00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,640
these specifics and qualitative and

00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:00,140
quantitative and a little bit of this

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,780
that all needs to come together that in

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,430
a very very scary way but if we've

00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:08,119
talked it through enough then we can

00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,440
learn each other's language and I know

00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,869
that there will probably be some

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,430
questions now and I always leave not

00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:16,780
enough time but now I've got enough time

00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,780
and ask some questions

00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,080
yes

00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:36,210
yeah that is very interesting questions

00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,310
the question was how do you approach

00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,660
requirements gathering if it's an agile

00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,030
versus a waterfall approach and I've

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,390
done both and I went and did the scrum

00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:47,220
master training and all of that and I

00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,680
think there's a sort of this idea that

00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,869
with waterfall we have to write it all

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,000
down first and we have to know every

00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,970
last detail until before we can actually

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,040
begin and with agile that we can just

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,960
start and I think the truth is somewhere

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,569
in the middle and you're going to have a

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,170
similar list for both I think agile just

00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:09,510
means that we can stop and change our

00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,950
mind every two weeks and waterfall

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,569
sometimes means I can change my mind

00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:16,130
whenever you want but and it just comes

00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:18,780
down to like how amiable are we to that

00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:21,180
sometimes that's what happens but I

00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,270
think that if it's if it's a project

00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,849
that needs to be waterfall it needs a

00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,859
lot more planning time up front and they

00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:31,369
can't just hand you a big you know 100

00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:34,980
page document say it's all in there and

00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:37,170
agile basically means that you can you

00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,150
can plan out you know larger chunks and

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,450
then get into the details during the

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,450
sprints

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,819
I think there's a microphone over there

00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:58,549
I don't know if it's if we should be I

00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:58,549
don't know just yell yes glasses

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,640
right so the question is how do you help

00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,849
your clients who are engaged in an agile

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,859
project understand that they can't just

00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:31,730
keep changing things over and over again

00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:33,230
well part one is do they have enough

00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,299
money to change things over and over and

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,980
over again then there are and I'm not

00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:39,079
even joking there are many projects that

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,450
are like that they are just ongoing it

00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,740
is it's it's a gardening project you

00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,029
know every season we're doing something

00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,289
different we're improving something

00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:48,019
we're making something better and that's

00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:49,250
the project but that's probably not the

00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,480
kind that you're looking at you're

00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,829
looking at the ones where there is a

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,630
fixed budget and I think that if you if

00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:58,819
you have allocated budget towards things

00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,650
so instead of saying I need events

00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:02,529
calendar how much does that cost well I

00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:06,619
don't know how long is a piece of string

00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:09,740
what you what you can do is say of this

00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:12,890
budget how much should we allocate for

00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:15,380
this feature if we just you know

00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,269
out-of-the-box Drupal vanilla boom it's

00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,740
going to take up one quarter of this

00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:21,410
budget you have three quarters left to

00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,960
customize so they can change within that

00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:26,180
budget I mean I've done that before that

00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,250
works really well but like completely

00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,250
sweeping changes well then nobody was

00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,480
told what the website purpose was if

00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,309
we're changing everything I get

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,920
ecommerce and community and nests

00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:39,109
elearning like which one is it let's

00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,140
just then then the projects too big and

00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:48,039
it needs to be cut into smaller pieces

00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:48,039
does that help cool yes

00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:09,710
yeah okay so had something like that

00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:12,260
recently and there is if you look at the

00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:16,039
web web metrics there is some sort of

00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:19,039
success factor that they can understand

00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:21,020
that makes it a successful website so

00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:25,010
for example say I have content

00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:27,079
publishing I've got people coming to the

00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,640
site they're looking at ads there you

00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,369
know encouraged to sign up for something

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,170
there are things that we can measure as

00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:37,400
a business for them right like hey so I

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,349
usually ask you know what are you

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,420
measuring what are we starting off with

00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:43,279
how many and they're like oh google and

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,750
analytics and it's all in there no what

00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:47,119
are you measuring as a business you know

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:49,010
how where are your subscriptions at okay

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,299
and and how much do they usually go up

00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:55,369
every year and how much would you like

00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:58,240
them to go up and what if we could get

00:43:55,369 --> 00:44:00,410
some insight on user behavior for you

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,119
because a lot of the time and you ask

00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:05,829
what our users doing on your site LOL

00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:08,539
hmm google analytics says about page

00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:11,150
that's not what they're doing what are

00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:14,630
they actually doing so there are tools

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:16,640
and and some of them are can be really

00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,950
subtle gorilla analytics to you can get

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,470
on the call a support call CSR if

00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:24,020
anybody has customer support you're just

00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:27,140
like hey you know what you really cut

00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:29,329
the budget for fa cues and support if we

00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,829
just can listen in a little bit or talk

00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:33,470
to your customer support people about

00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:35,750
what clients are asking all of a sudden

00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,400
who write that customer support call

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,020
that's costing them something it's like

00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,490
six dollars you call two dollars a call

00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,010
and all of a sudden they're taking half

00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:47,180
as many that's money so the decision

00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:49,039
makers if you can suggest that there

00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,539
might be a way to save some money if you

00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,200
come up with a little plan and just kind

00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:55,460
of sneak in and try to find some stuff

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,369
more often than not they're quite

00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,109
receptive so instead of like you know

00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:03,349
I'm not asking if the users prefer red

00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:04,940
or blue no I'm I'm not even asking

00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:10,390
sometimes I'm just looking over their

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,390
shoulder cool

00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:22,560
you can also come up and talk to me

00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:32,849
after if it's like a super secret thing

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:39,060
you want to ask me about yes oh gosh

00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:42,150
yeah many um there I should probably

00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,470
when i upload my slides put a reading

00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,359
list at the end because that would be

00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:47,190
easier i think i'm trying to think of

00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,109
them through a lot of stuffs online a

00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:52,820
lot of that there's some really amazing

00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:55,530
sites that are producing some really

00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,660
great articles that didn't exist 10

00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,910
years ago like just it nobody was

00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:07,550
talking about things like that so I've

00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:07,550
yeah subscribe to a few cool so

00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:30,450
ah yeah yeah so the question is about

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,620
how do you recognize unconscious

00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:36,000
requirements of your own organization

00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:37,710
and um let me just let me tell you a

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,930
little bit afore when I asked my kid

00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:43,890
who's 14 what she's done at school she

00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:45,240
says hmm you know saying stuff and

00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,980
that's what we think about our own

00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,990
organization like I know a shop to work

00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,060
and I'm enter some data and I process

00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:53,240
some things and that's where I want

00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,250
granularity like that's where like okay

00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,500
sit down you push a button you enter

00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,970
your password you navigate to this like

00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,100
I want to know where all those little

00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,750
individual things are that you're doing

00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,200
because some of those are going to be a

00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:09,690
little bit like unnecessary funky a

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,250
little awkward and and honestly if you

00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,460
just make a log of all kinds of things

00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,690
to somebody else who's not been looking

00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,300
at it for years and years and years when

00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,410
you kind of explain what you're doing

00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,900
there'll be some questions somebody will

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,730
say oh well why do because I when we do

00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:27,270
that we have this thing and we pull it

00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:29,760
in the export and so I think it's hard

00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,930
to tell culturally what's happening

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,670
unless you go to a different country and

00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,020
see what are they doing over there so

00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,780
there's I think there's an incredible

00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,830
value to going to meet ups and talking

00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,240
through processes with other

00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,120
organizations who have similar but

00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,830
different types of processes because

00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,530
they're going to say we had that problem

00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:48,920
we solved it this way or even try and do

00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,720
that for years how did you do that and

00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,640
again those conversations it's hard to

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,980
do this in a silo it's hard to do this

00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,180
all on your own the message here is to

00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,920
really get involved and have those

00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,290
conversations with multidisciplinary

00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,610
groups with everybody on your team and

00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,380
pulling in people that you had like

00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,300
grandma I mean explain something to you

00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,890
you tell me if it sounds weird and which

00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,840
part you don't understand that is

00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,940
totally valuable way of testing and

00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,080
validating something I try to explain

00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,840
things to my kid because she's an

00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:19,310
extremely non-technical at 14 it's

00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,310
really weird but it works

00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,300
Chad

00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:36,829
they don't really want to change the

00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,829
navigation leather exist

00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:06,400
right so are they resistant to trying

00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,400
usability study are they resistant okay

00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:22,910
yeah yeah yeah yeah so how do you bring

00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:24,589
in some usable usability research how do

00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,049
you bring in the voice of the user if

00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:31,520
the stakeholders are resistance

00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:34,130
sometimes I do it secretly and and what

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,309
I mean by that is I I look at analytics

00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:40,099
I look at the paths I try to write out

00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:41,690
mission critical tasks so you know if

00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:42,440
your business is signing people up and

00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:46,130
they need to get through registration

00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,829
and everybody drops off at step two do

00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:50,150
you want to find out why I need a little

00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:52,520
bit of ammunition right you can be like

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,569
let's see what you know what what we can

00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,309
find because then they're just like

00:49:53,569 --> 00:49:56,839
you're just you're just digging holes

00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:59,650
and filling them in you can find a

00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:02,359
little something aside hey so I noticed

00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,130
that this is really interesting thing

00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:06,349
happening to your site and here it is

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,710
I'm seeing it in the analytics should we

00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:11,030
find out why I guarantee you like they

00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,400
give you a permission to just do that

00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:15,799
one piece and that's going to give you I

00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:22,780
think the foot in the door to do a bit

00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:22,780
more yeah secretly yes

00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:48,829
yeah that's a hard question so the

00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:51,650
question is about RFP initial quote and

00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:53,000
then some kind of discovery process or

00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,380
IAA or something that happens and then

00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,339
something completely different that you

00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:01,579
need to reconcile yeah and do you

00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:05,950
document how you got from A to B because

00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:05,950
that's yeah okay

00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,780
right no no I think I think that's a

00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,390
moving target I think it's going to be I

00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,860
mean this it's different than saying

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:28,180
because we're going because you've made

00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,460
a decision that changes what we're

00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,200
building halfway through this is now

00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,700
fifty percent more work that's different

00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,400
than I think re estimating the entire

00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,890
project all the time but I think you can

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,290
get to a place where you can say we

00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,400
re-estimate at this point usually it's

00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:44,020
after information architecture

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,810
wireframing you know when you're heading

00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:49,390
into design weary estimate at this point

00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,440
and this is the place where there's a

00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,960
whole bunch of stuff that's just

00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,540
happened that we've learned more that

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,130
we've realized is more complex and if

00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,810
you're able to show where everything is

00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:00,340
more complex like see like and this is

00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:03,040
so tedious we've done this before like

00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,300
the RFP says you have this and then we

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,000
found out that you really need it like

00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,950
this but with three do whatever's then

00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,640
you can map it out and say because this

00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:16,150
is now more complex we need to add more

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,920
time for it however sometimes they go

00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:19,180
but we don't want it to be that complex

00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,250
we want it back to that original

00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,510
estimate and then you're in that

00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,070
negotiation again then you're in

00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:27,190
trade-offs and then you're okay so

00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:28,660
you've told us how it was built because

00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,800
sometimes there's the legacy system that

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:32,080
you dread they're trying to quote on

00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:35,110
we've figured out that this is built in

00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:38,020
a really funky way but really we think

00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,970
that you only really need like hmm this

00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:42,400
piece here all the rest I don't know

00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:44,020
this is and this is a really big thing

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,540
that happens with with access and roles

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,320
and permissions in my experience so

00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,060
there are people who leave their

00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,500
computer unlocked and their office door

00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,140
unlocked and they work with people they

00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:57,910
like but they want to nail down the

00:52:53,140 --> 00:53:00,130
access so no one can edit my blog and I

00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:03,820
just don't see why they want to spend

00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:06,100
money on that if I'm friends with Nancy

00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:07,690
poor Nancy I'm just going to let her

00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,910
know that I had at my blog please Nancy

00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,710
and if she's like if she's having issues

00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:14,550
with that that's an HR problem that's

00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,550
not a technical problem

00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:33,010
five minutes yes yeah yes yes yes

00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:34,660
usually they're completely useless the

00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,369
way that they've been done yeah because

00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:40,360
would be their elite they'll be leading

00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:45,369
questions they'll be um you know the the

00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:49,090
kind of like customer appreciation or

00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:51,250
you know net what do they call them Net

00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:53,410
Promoter scores well there's nothing to

00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:56,530
a website so like hey I really love your

00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:58,480
organ do you like this Pizza Company yes

00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:00,130
they do they love our website no they've

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,240
just said that they like your pizza

00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,830
there's nothing to do with the website

00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,680
so i really find that a lot of surveys

00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:08,020
they just haven't really nailed it yet

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,840
or they'll like do you think our website

00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,400
is easy not easy difficult not difficult

00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,290
and it's just people just like i just

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,940
want the server to be done so i think a

00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:18,790
lot of surveys are done extremely poorly

00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,920
and if you can pull out some information

00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:23,200
to show like this here's a little bit

00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,060
gray and fuzzy we were like to maybe ask

00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,210
these questions again in a different way

00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,890
in an educated a can run a survey now

00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:33,160
because they can use the tool the tool

00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:34,750
is not the way to get the best analysis

00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,760
because there's this thinking that has

00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:39,340
to go into the questions in order to

00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:42,180
actually get reasonable answers that are

00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:49,740
meaningful so I mean that's difficult

00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:49,740
you have those hmm yeah so the survey

00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,920
there's a few things I want to know yes

00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,619
which tools that I use

00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:29,370
ah I have aux roll so I do design a test

00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:33,180
I would love it if I can work closely

00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:34,710
with the stakeholder team because they

00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,810
need to have buy-in they need to

00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:39,000
understand what we're testing or they

00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:41,100
just don't appreciate the results very

00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,350
well so there's different tools that I

00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,240
have and it comes down to what do we

00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:48,830
want to find out what are we trying to

00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:52,920
find out user behavior user preferences

00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:56,700
is it you know optimal structure is it

00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,770
comprehension so depending on the

00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,350
question that I have that I'm trying to

00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:02,700
answer i will use different tools

00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:06,210
sometimes I'll push those back to the

00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:10,740
client and have them with my help with

00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:12,390
my facilitation actually run the test

00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:15,060
and then I'll look at the results it

00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:18,360
just depends on what it is does that

00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:21,050
answer a question it's a whole other

00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,050
session

00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:33,550
well I think we're kind of that time so

00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:35,859
thank you so much do feel free to

00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,990

00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:40,920
