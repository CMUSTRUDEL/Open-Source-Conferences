Theming in Drupal8 have was a massive shift from phptemplate to twig, but its more than changing the syntax . We changed the way of thinking Drupal Theming.
Drupal twig Theming is easy to learn, powerful, flexible and overall as awesome as warm coffee on a rainy day, the downside is that all the things you learned in Drupal now have to be relearned, and yes its by design.
