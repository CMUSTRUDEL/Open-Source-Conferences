Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	A hands on Drupal8 Theming extravaganza 

Theming in Drupal8 have was a massive shift from phptemplate to twig, but its more than changing the syntax . We changed the way of thinking Drupal Theming.
Drupal twig Theming is easy to learn, powerful, flexible and overall as awesome as warm coffee on a rainy day, the downside is that all the things you learned in Drupal now have to be relearned, and yes its by design.

Over the last 3 years we (the frontend drupaltwig group) we  got one burning question from the Drupal community.

“How I do this right the first time ? ”  

The Session will be a hands on, based on a ton of real world examples. To show how and where to to get your Drupal8 theming right the first time. Mixed with background info & all the secret stories from the last 5+ years of rethinking theming in drupal - basically where all the bodys are buried ( We was there when we buried them)

The secret plan behind it all, understand the concept.
Template building: understanding the template suggestions & how to organise 120+ template files.
Base theme(s) - do you need em ?
Modern css structures & templates, how it all fits together.
Pack your theme - cmi ftw!
Tips tricks & dirty secrets.
Real markup control, no stinking php!
Audience level:
The session is for web designers, frontenders & developers that wanna know how we designed the frontend in D8.

Takeaway:
You should be prober equipped to get down & dirty with Drupal theming in Drupal8, the session is build on all the questions i got over the last 3+ years, when working on Drupal8 theme system

all right should we try to start on time

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,019
just for once would be a good idea all

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,019
right if people want to come in they're

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,880
still a little bit of seats around so

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,920
this might be a little bit of tempo

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,230
might going to take 60 minutes if

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,270
anybody have questions and as we go

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,100
along just jump up to the mic and yell

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,439
or just yell from your seat be like hey

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,199
what did you mean they're a lot of these

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,390
are new concepts new thinking's that

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,140
we've been doing for the last X amount

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,610
of years that you might not used to so

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,630
they're not going to be some new kinds

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,200
of going to be like little but while

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,690
doing it like that anyways it is now

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,760
eleven o'clock and i'm ready to start

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,879
I'm so happy that three swarmed you all

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,710
up for my keynote so that's always nice

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,629
I've been all relaxed this morning and

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,000
was drinking coffee and so all of these

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,340
wonderful slides and wishes people had

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,350
for the front end and how apparently the

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,050
front end doesn't matter in truble I

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,420
might kind of comment on that at some

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,400
point during these slides and now that

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,830
I'm in the US I also know that people

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,470
have a tendency to say oh he has a bad

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,170
language I cannot help that I'm attained

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,100
we don't even have the word pleased in

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,619
our language so that's how it is and yes

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,869
if anybody have following the TV shows

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,689
Vikings it is pretty much spot on that's

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,000
just how we are today a very peaceful

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:34,520
people until we get pissed the up

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,520
hence the keynote alright so let's go a

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,810
this thing called so this is me modern

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,180
DK actually it's wonderful to be in

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,729
Nolan's because being a Dane called

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,640
Morton there's two places in the u.s.

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,310
they can say my name one place is up in

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,570
in Minnesota apparently they know how to

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,130
pronounce more than the best of the

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,500
world here it's more ton because

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,969
apparently I'm assault I do think you

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,920
should all sprinkle a little bit of more

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,990
ton on everything but that's a whole

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,729
nother thing but in this beautiful part

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,649
of the world we do have another king

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,710
which is more than Anderson the most

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,069
scoring player in the NFL how he is not

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,239

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,740
just going to put it out like that

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,630
anyways if you don't

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,920

company called tech one consulting with

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,570
building big big big complicated web

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,970
sites with a bunch of really good notes

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,330
I used to be the anchor Thema in this

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,820
magazine called the Drupal wats talk and

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,750
I'm also classy maintainer which is our

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,250
one of our core new themes basically if

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,360
you want to ask you anything go with a

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,830
modern DK Drupal quick it's gonna be our

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,630
hashtag for anything to just put out

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,510
stuff on Twitter this kind of our main

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,570
communication stuff and DC NOLA as well

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,100
um so the DK is for diff killer by the

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,780
way just so you know that's how it's

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,970
been for the last many years I just

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,590
launched my website finally on Drupal 8

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,300
and it's kind of broken in multiple

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,490
different browsers but doesn't matter

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,740
it's finally up again yes i sat in

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,480
atlanta and i pushed the code right as i

00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,770
was walking in on the flight and what

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,390
are the first response from people not

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,760
good to see your website up more than

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,550
awesomely put SVG files in line into a

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,620
link no it's broken in my browsers this

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,540
burden supposed to look like that thank

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,650
you for that by the way anyways drupal

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,720
trick is where you're going to put it in

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,370
so for the last three or four years i

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,230
know that's actually alive for the last

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,130
10 years I've been in the tuple world

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,450
for the last nine years and 360 days

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,280
I've been pitching and learning about

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,810
what was wrong in the front end of Jubal

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,670
and I've been actually in this industry

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,810
for 20 years this year which is kind of

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,240
scary anybody here who's 20 years old

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,570
dude you act like you're 13 that's not

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,220
being 20 years old anyways I've gotten

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,570
one question when I've traveled the

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,010
world this is kind of just someone to

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,720
place up and out speaking about this

00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,760
thing and I got one question all the

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,770
time around this whole like drupal 8

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,830
things like how am I gonna do it right

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,390
it's not about can I do it this way or

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,860
that way at this way or that plano

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,959
attacked I just want to do it right and

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,940
my first answer that was rolled you know

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,400
you can just do it this way or that way

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,810
like hey can you just give me one way of

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,690
doing these things and then I'm gonna

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,250
figure out the best of them and for once

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,320
in my life I got a little bit nervous

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,090
cause I was like no I have a whole room

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,000
here front enders that we have google is

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,480
very large system everybody actually

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,860
asked you

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,290
eat this question why are you asking me

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,550
about I don't know I mean or more you

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,960
kind of should know because you've been

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,460
here for how many years how many years

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
if you're doing that who else should

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,060
know i was looking about the room and

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,680
china up and who was just in here he ran

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,120
away because like no no tuple seven that

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,890
was my fault jubilate that's your fault

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,390
models like damn it so no I kind of have

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,640
to take some of this responsibility on

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,140
and but before we dive into that we need

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,320
to do one thing we just need to take one

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,750
step back four years ago 2012 that was

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,870
when we finally said okay we really need

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,730
to fix this theming system this is in

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,340
Munich you see you can see John you can

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,070
see me to see Jen Lambton and in Munich

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,100
four years ago we had a small little

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,020
discussion nine hours at the whiteboard

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,550
where I've defended everybody who wanted

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,860
hug you against not changing the theme

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,870
system happened there but there's one

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,150
session that Jen did where she talked

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,460
about we need at this China friendly

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,960
theme system that is the thing we're

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,330
trying to build we are not trying to

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
build a json parser all kinds of other

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,750
thing we're trying to build a theme

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,420
system that is easy for normal people to

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,190
use or my kind of people you know the

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,460
designers those who like to do pretty

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,990
stuff because at that point we were not

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,240
even speaking to this group we're just

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,980
like nerding out which kind of God

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,080
entropy an issue so we created a bunch

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,210
of different principles first us in

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,590
Drupal 8 will start from nothing nothing

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,930
our base point we don't start with a

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,820
 ton of different classes a markup

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,340
or perspective or can you start with

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,410
nothing and built on top of that built

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,000
on real use cases if eighty percent of

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,350
people is doing this way how about we

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,300
just solved their problem instead of

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,430
trying to solve every problem in the

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,380
world they'll provide tools so we can

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,290
find stuff make it visible so you can

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,960
access to your templates consistency in

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,900
everything and last but not least don't

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,150
dumb it down because believe it or not

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,830
if contenders are not all Themis or

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,530
designers of what we call yourself is

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,330
not complete idiots some are but it's

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,800
not like a status of like you work in

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,510
the front and oh you played with Koreans

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,010
I better like give to this riddle for

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,900
you you can play with it because you

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,270
cannot figure this stuff out I mean it

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,250
is also put the stuff out to these six

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,860
million different devices right that's

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,660
kind of what we do so anyways the thing

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,340
is you need a website so you need you

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,199
actually designing it continuity

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,080
code you need devops you need all these

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,150
things you want good house that's gonna

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,220
come out well here's think there's no

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,370
theme you cannot get anything out of it

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,050
it's not gonna be able to show anywhere

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,120
another thing is that the theme should

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,190
be pretty by default how do we blow up

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,970
these things um because if we have no

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,310
theme this is what we have this is jason

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,630
this is the stuff google would then

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,370
pretty much put out if we didn't put it

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:13,700
through a theme actually this is pretty

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:16,590
Jason this is to Allah Jason here we go

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,210
so when I hear during a keynote that

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,100
like twenty percent things we should

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,910
have like one of the lowest thing is

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:28,290
having better tools for the front end

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:29,760
this is Drupal without a front end it is

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,500
that's the whole thing you want to build

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,289
a better UX experience how are you going

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,210
to build that with HTML and CSS and

00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:38,160
JavaScript at the end of the day that is

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,780
what we put out if we don't have the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,940
right tools if we cannot control this

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,500
from the ground up every little

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,389
inch we're going to control it we cannot

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,889
build these things so it doesn't matter

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,180
that somebody sitting in single

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,250
somewhere dreaming about us building

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,320
better experiences if we don't have the

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,940
tools for them maybe we have a little

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:59,639
light in the dark what do you think that

00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:02,280
is small little thing coming out drupal

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,840
8 tweak that is all light in the

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,970
darkness that is the thing we're going

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,020
to build all these things on because

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,880
fundamental this is about

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,370
controlscontrol of markup and she says

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,870
it is not about the numbers of divs or

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,580
classes we put into it it's about

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,889
controlling every little thing of it

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,590
it's not a hundred control it's 101

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,620
percent control and it's not every test

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:26,130
oh I wish is how it's going to be okay

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,690
any questions nobody have the nuts to

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,050
stand up and say well really think you

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:34,440
shoot alright so let's built this the

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:37,260
right way um let's not about this forget

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,959
Drupal 7 can you can you feel it just

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:44,910
forget about because it looks like this

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:48,210
so let's do this

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:52,010
ah how does that feel how does that feel

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,330
trooper Sammis now all our blood so they

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,280
start where we should start at our pace

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,530
team our basic building block that we

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,010
are building on it's pretty simple

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:04,320
basting stable this is the lowest level

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,300
you can get see how we built you recall

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,730
so up there you have you have caught you

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,830
have stable you have class ii Google

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,940
calm and stable if we look at that then

00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,140
we have come trips Eames and then you

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,600
have your own teams right that's kind of

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,250
a whole family of themes we have and by

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,170
the way I have all of my slides already

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,570
they're already online I'm going to push

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,340
the UL to it that very last and you

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,640
cannot guess the URL so I stopped trying

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,290
to do that um so you don't have to go

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,900
penny more like at them i got to get all

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,520
this data in anyways stable stable is

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,460
this wonderful thing it's a complete

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,990
clone of Drupal core so all of course

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,770
templates are now on the team called

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,480
stable stable is no a replica of

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,760
jubilate which means that we can begin

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,500
to fix stuff in jubilate because believe

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,480
it or not when we came up with jubilate

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,400
like four or five months ago it was not

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,140
perfectly done I mean we might going to

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,700
find it a little issue or two back in

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,570
Google seven country we could not change

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,580
anything so let's say here this is if

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,600
you go into two links that HTML touch

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,670
wake you kind of figure out there's

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,380
actually a hard-coded in line class in

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,930
there that of course you cannot have

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,120
because it can mess with your version of

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,850
you in line class so probably an 8.2 we

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
kind of remove that if you're not using

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,970
so if you look at your theme you got you

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,630
got the inlet class and now make it blue

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,760
crab so if i don't use stable and will

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,950
repair it we remove it from Drupal core

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,890
what's going to happen now your stuff is

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,950
going to be away so don't rely on core

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,990
on anything rely on stable or rely on

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,270
classy and the difference between calm

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,890
and stable and class is basically this

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,550
is what stable puts out a trapper and

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:40,050
the data that's it um classy puts out a

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,000
bunch of classes for you so you have

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,440
some default it's kind of like our way

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,400
of figuring out how we can do this so

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,230
classy is our stable is our way of

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,840
protecting ourselves against all the

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,850
things we did not fix back when we came

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,020
out but you would call so you can do

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,660
whatever you want to do with your things

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,560
and if you go base the in false as you

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,230
can do we're just

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,300
get google cost elements in I promise

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,520
you we will break your themes because we

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,140
will fix whatever goes on Google call so

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,790
just don't do that now you have been

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,380
warned so we're not going to see anybody

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,720
wine in the issue queue likewise my

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,580
stuff broken i will paste the info you

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,589
always have a base theme you have always

00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,570
had a base team back in the days it was

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,690
just called Google seven or Google six

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,560
and now you stable or use class if you

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,370
want to have classes in use that so I'm

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,050
documentation for that and i bought a

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,170
little article on it for on my brand new

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,510
spanking websites um so I'm talking

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,160
about coach of raising a lot so so why

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,660
is that well because no we want to have

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,220
the theme to be in control of the markup

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,339
and CSS that's always been a thing and

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,810
the way we're doing that is basically

00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,010
every time we come into a template what

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,779
you first gonna have this is where we

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,460
define all of our classes we define a

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,380
variable putting it over the class now

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,089
you can merge them around you can build

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,160
whatever you want to do and then we have

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,750
the HTML that is separated down again

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,960
and you can drill into the data and grab

00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,900
the data out because no HTML and CSS is

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,060
is one thing you should always do is

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,740
always put it inside your template don't

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,170
put anything in a variable don't put in

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,760
no don't put a class in your pre pause

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,320
there's always put a variable provide

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,750
the variable for your template your

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,940
future you will help you out with that

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,530
um and this fine gentleman down here he

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,440
put a question to me yesterday it's like

00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:22,350
yo and what if I want to see my stuff

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,839
based on a node ID my answer to that is

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,730
of course no don't do that you are wrong

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,710
we also all know we're gonna Cowboys

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,640
things so let's just start up by calling

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:34,290
this example so my cowboy element here

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,770
is I need to have this hot

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,390
cowboy class merge into my body and it's

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,150
going to put in this image of the trick

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,160
cowboy what you do that is then you go

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,010
into a pre process and the preprocessed

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,589
are going I taste and denote so such

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,540
vanilla vanilla is the theme name

00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:53,280
preprocess is the preprocessed an HTML

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,410
as my HTML template so this is where I'm

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,700
going to send it I didn't go in I test

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,070
on the note going with Drew ball

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,560
Bogaerts get / me to get that note if

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,470
there is a note create a new variable I

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,100
call it in it NID node ID and get me the

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:11,520
node ID fair enough now my node ID is

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,480
ready for my template so this is just to

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,459
sum it up

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,040
so what I'm doing now inside of my

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,579
template I say set body classes that's

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,430
an array within twig I test if there's a

00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:26,639
node ID that's equal in this instance

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,880
158 node ID and then I have now a class

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,529
that is hot walking cowboy which in my

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,389
example when I just doing this code it's

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:36,089
just yanking and this was a hot pink

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:38,070
background basically we can do these if

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,720
else is inside of twix that we can do

00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,769
all over you begin to build your classes

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,529
that way that's when you begin to have

00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:46,560
the absolute control of it so basically

00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:49,680
the girls you know set some level of a

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,360
variable test on something oh are you

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,610
gonna get the cowboy I'm gonna get nada

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,699
that's the two variation of it um and

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,490
that's how oh it's just go back one step

00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:01,199
and that's how if every time you look

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,449
into these predefined classes this error

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,040
set if you think in that way you now

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:09,630
have the control of what actually goes

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,490
on anything so the other thing that we

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,740
have in Drupal and Drupal 8 is that

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,839
everything is a template in Drupal 7

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,029
used to be functions now we took all the

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,069
functions we rip them out and we killed

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,910
them and killing all the function was a

00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:25,319
good thing as you so good i had to take

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,670
a picture that they be removed the last

00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:28,889
function and that is actually the commit

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:33,690
comment that says die theme functions

00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:36,959
die now so in Google aid now out the box

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:40,079
you have at least 135 different template

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,649
files that's a ton of files how many of

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,420
X you work with which you relate so far

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:48,360
ok who has not who's like what are you

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,920
even talking about ok I hope you can

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,069
follow else just they'll ask questions

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,510
later on there's a session on friday as

00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:56,760
well that's it going to be like more

00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,279
fundamentals this is kind of a huge

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,199
situation new idea so if i have 135

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,120
different templates my life is going to

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,550
be miserable if they're all in one one

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,079
file so i go through two different ways

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,750
you can organize this either you can go

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,670
like the normal the way we designed the

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,589
system up first that was like going

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,420
here's you here's my templates this is

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,730
classy inside of class you have them

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,680
grouped in these different groups so one

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,779
for layouts one for the blocks 14 did

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,579
you use one for content 14 edit one for

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,740
fields navigation elements datasets

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,310
forms and so forth so epi element is

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,970
like

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:32,520
by what it does that's all fine until at

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,320
some point you have a ton of files

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,200
because you want to know fix every

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,970
little piece of markup so it's basically

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
like it's thought this way and you have

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,730
these different element you can call

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,830
them in you have different variation of

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,570
them and file names and you're going to

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,490
end up with this this is kind of the

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,779
different templates that you can use you

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,670
can use the site of theme you can call

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,790
them and drop them in fair enough this

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,680
gives you a lot of variations and you

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,450
can we still have we have one big

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,250
library file we call in our CSS files

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:05,220
can go it that way and that's all good

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,900
and the problem can be that at some

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,490
point and you're going to get a little

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,690
bit tired of this curse you know you go

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,760
in and you look at the node and this

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,320
node is now we're so I feel that ok so

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,630
my feelings over my fields fold and so

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,510
forth so I was reading up on all this

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,250
component based front end stuff like I

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,170
wonder what that is because I was

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,670
beginning to put all my stuff into one

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,110
folder here's my note if we put

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,060
everything in my note into my folder

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,740
here's my navigation everything into the

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,970
navigation beginning to group stuff that

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,940
way I ran into some really fun air

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,410
quotes for the mic issues around that

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,510
and that's why some things we're going

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,820
to look at so my whole idea is I have

00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,370
base templates these base templates show

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,230
off me the like basic elements of how a

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,089
thing comes out as you can see there is

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,560
let's see here there's a container

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,990
there's a field and there's a paragraph

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,050
that's like base basic templates they're

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,630
going to put out then and if you look

00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,460
through it that's all my base stuff then

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,050
I have another folder called components

00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,600
and if you look at some of these that

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,699
have leg a folder called comment another

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,740
one called footer the uncle header I

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,380
have a hero ever logo I've missed it's a

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,110
navigation no teacher powered by drupal

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,179
so now I'm not building it within the

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,160
idea of what Google does it's more like

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,900
what is what does this do on my page hey

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,870
this is my navigation just taking all of

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,130
my navigation files put in one place

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,990
because then when I have to work with it

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,030
later on I don't have to go into my

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,800
image folder and figure out what did we

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,940
call those images you know when you look

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,470
at your image folder after three years

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,970
on a project that has like all this crap

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,470
in and you have no idea where it came

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,570
from like she'll be just the leaders

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,000
like let's try and your site just

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,230
explodes in possible way is because you

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,230
have no idea where come

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,059
um it's probably gonna be just as bad in

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,549
six to eight months but right now it

00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,740
feels really good anyway so the next

00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:53,309
vault I'm working on is called layout

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,470
and anybody hear you smacks at the

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:58,740
channel yes can you spot a pattern how I

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,059
built my templates yep exactly it's kind

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,380
of the same thinking of smacks you have

00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,090
a base you have these elementary of

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,890
these layouts have these components I

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,169
don't have themes inside of my theme

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,730
because the man I got to hi there I was

00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,549
trying to figure out some fun way but it

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,559
missed and then my CSS file Jesus folder

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,330
I still have CSS CSS folder but that's

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,760
only for the base and the layout like

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,740
the basic elements then I take all of my

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,570
CSS all of my image files all of my

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,880
elements and need for tip and component

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,470
and I put that all into one folder just

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,840
going to want you the first time you

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,480
have a CSS file right next to a template

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,010
file by next year SVG file it feels like

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,570
you're doing something wrong but I also

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,020
kind of like to do that because I'm a

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,490
bad boy something uh God yeah it's too

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,710
early for that sort of that anyways

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,809
let's go back to the point so here's my

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,730
folder it's like templates components

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,250
note inside of note I had noticed a

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,309
month or two it I feel test note there's

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,049
foo fuel note bar and so forth then I

00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,990
have like the library's file then call

00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,730
in and I inject my CSS and my JavaScript

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,650
files in now if you're seeing here is

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,350
encapsulate in this little folder here's

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:07,140
all of my note stuff the problem is now

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,970
that if I just put my note note folder

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,880
and I have a field template drop that

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,830
field template in things get stupid I

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,299
might have missed used the whole day to

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,370
try to figure out why something didn't

00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:19,350
know right until I learned by looking in

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,419
my sauce that feels get overwritten

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,890
based on the field name your field name

00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,530
needs to be very unique when you do this

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,270
um it's a good example of showing you

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,000
how you can add new thing suggestions

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,929
because how Google does it it goes look

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,880
through your folders as a template /

00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:38,160
abcdefg which template to a hit first

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,350
the first one I hit I take that done and

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,210
I move on which means that in this

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,809
example you know I have my template /

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,850
says set no HTML that way but it's the

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,980
template that is in da folder is going

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,870
to get written how I can do that is kind

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,650
of our whole special city on side of our

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,390
templates

00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,040
so I give it a more specific name as you

00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,350
can see in a temperature distance that's

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,380
going to be hidden in so I begin to do

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:04,450
this pattern instead instead so the idea

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,980
is that on your file name you're going

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,080
to get these long long filename each

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,310
file name it's going to be it's part of

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,800
the file name is going to be separated

00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,480
with three underscores because one under

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,430
store can be inside of a name like a

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,960
field name that would be epic space and

00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,600
the field name would be an underscore so

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,210
we need to underscore between between

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,320
the identifier 101 underscore for the

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,990
name and then three underscores between

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,770
each or going to separate them up so

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,360
you're going to end up with like

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,610
something I feel the name of the field

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,500
bundle the name of the van type the name

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,020
of the time these names are going to be

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,400
long here's the beautiful thing it makes

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,800
sense when you look at them and you can

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,570
act you can see that all the way and the

00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,030
way you do this is using using this

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:47,590
thing the hook theme suggestion hook

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:49,300
alter so many hooks what we do here is

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,040
basically this I have my vanilla is my

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,320
first that's my team name theme

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,630
suggestions the fields and now in my

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,450
feel you can see the really dirty trick

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,820
I do where to above this vanilla theme

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,680
suggestions I put that hit as a theme

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,150
suggestion name the reason I do that is

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,250
now when I look at my source code I

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,720
can't figure out what goes on I'm not

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,300
the brightest person on earth and when I

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,490
have 25 different temperature Jason it's

00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,290
kind of nice to have that in and then I

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,840
begin to group them up so I get them as

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,060
specific as possible so we end up with

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,800
something like this you can see how

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,210
specific I need to go in and find each

00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,790
template because the templates do not

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,410
care where they live so this is my way

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:32,170
of like securing that I do not override

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:34,630
my own stuff a bundle bundle is the

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,450
content type but by the machine name

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,920
Google cultured bundle and up and I was

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,140
like what should I call they should I

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,240
call the contents have like a think I'm

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,340
just gonna use the name Bantle and yes I

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,750
also have confused one there is a clever

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:52,720
day in town there that has an answer for

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:57,110
this ooh it's the entity type as a

00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,180
google front end I really don't care

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:10,500
see now he's for the camera I have an

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:12,510
angry Dane looking at bball like I've

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,290
I've been here for 10 years what do I

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:19,770
know god damn it ok moving fast on this

00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,660
what the first roll you get a sticker so

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,130
you have the same name and then you have

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,810
two hooks the hooks over there is like

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,300
the name of like the fields the page the

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,950
HTML that way and that's how I can grab

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,050
it now we can begin to modify it it's

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,960
really really simple but it ends up with

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,790
this this is my my coach widget I built

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,500
my own code viewer so I can like

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,080
postcode on my blog and it gets like

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,430
pretty color coded with prism so I

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,960
thought hey let's do a matter let me

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,240
show how to build a code viewer and show

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,830
the code for the code view um so this is

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,740
my whole visit and you can see I have my

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,330
coat CSS file the CSS file in the same

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,580
fold I'm so excited because now I can

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,120
find my CSS that's specific only for

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,460
this thing then I have a code SVG holy

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,710
 SVG files because a sweetie is the

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,910
 it's uber awesome and you know what

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,740
i'm going to do with this file we're

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,410
gonna include it directly into the

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,540
template so you're gonna have no HTTP

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,460
requests and built directly into to

00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,470
eight its week then I have some other

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,970
icons because I was fooling around have

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,890
paragraph that's killed i'm using the

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,010
paragraph module to build this paragraph

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,200
module is the bump by the way it's kind

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,620
of saved my life bunch of all times and

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,660
then I have these prism and prism is is

00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,880
the color coding viewer thing that does

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,340
some magic javascript stuff and I just

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,350
jump in so here's my code Bridget my

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,990
code is pretty simple it has f

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,600
field name you know a final name it has

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,330
language my code is on and then it has

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,350
the coat and and basically what what it

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,420
does is this it call codes my little

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,920
code snippet so i can now push little

00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:54,030
code snippets out on my web blog and

00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,460
they are pretty and viewable so what

00:23:54,030 --> 00:24:00,330
does is let's take a look at this if you

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:04,500
want to play as you can see the mark up

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:07,140
here is what's that let's see ooh SVG in

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,790
like e doesn't that just make you feel

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,970
good and I the only one who's crazy

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,250
excited about SVG

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,720
just like one thumbs up like in a year

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,640
you're going to be crazy excited about

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,910
SVG we can do all kinds of crazy stuff

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,580
with it it's amazing anyways this is by

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:26,090
the way Drupal it's not a security issue

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,010
we're going to talk about that later

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,930
this is my own file put in to get pushed

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:34,920
up on my server this is by the way

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:38,910
drupal markup just out the box nothing

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,870
else this is like basic stuff this is

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,190
mike going to be a little bit of a

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,870
change of you to work in drupal 7

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,250
anyways back to this so we have all

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,410
these different files how do we built

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:51,390
this well here's the first is that to

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,770
doc here's those yet I hope so because

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,570
all the code examples is written like

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,310
this it could be like really fun anyways

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,720
so the thing we're going to do here is

00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,730
we're going to stop stop I from the

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,500
template instead of defining a library I

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,120
call in from anywhere else but a

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,860
preprocessor and stuff I do it all from

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,870
my template file that's the whole idea

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,460
if you think you're doing your theme you

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,290
do that from your twig file if I want to

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,080
call in library and the library is where

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,970
we define our CSS and JavaScript the

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,290
reason for that is that modules also do

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,720
that so that this is the way you will

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:20,700
inject know you will add in CSS and

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,930
JavaScript rias to your files the thing

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,430
is when you begin to call them on each

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,500
file this begin to be really really

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,540
sweet because why would I call and CSS

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,670
if it's not needed on a specific like I

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,890
ever something for a forum why would I

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:34,350
add that to all of my CSS like a bee

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,900
reason for that I know but here I call

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,270
in this library and down here I do an

00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,090
inline SVG thingy I actually include the

00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:44,010
SVG directly so I can still edit my SVG

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,260
files from my edit for my whatever

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,960
graphic program i do i just asked each

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,210
way to included and inside of my library

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,680
comes up here so I love my library I

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,860
have a library called code snippet and

00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,230
that is defined to CSS files my code CSS

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,630
and my presence is and a javascript file

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,970
that is also in there and they all is in

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,290
my same folder so I do not now have to

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:11,250
jump around between different folders

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:12,480
it's all right there yes then if you

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,790
want to look at the whole like the

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,560
including so what i'm doing here is i'm

00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:19,200
doing the including and specifying the

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,290
whole path down to wherever my SVG file

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,700
is and now what twig is doing is taking

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,220
that ish VG file you can do this with

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,779
I HTML file as well you can even go go

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,649
keep it down would include you can

00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:33,690
actually take you can do your footer

00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:35,010
with regions inside of the HTML template

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,690
you can take that put that into an

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,830
include file as well and drop it

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,419
somewhere else but you want to drop it

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,490
you can like pass variables in to

00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:44,340
include file system includes are pretty

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,470
awesome it feels like to me like very

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,720
old-school PHP 3 the first time I didn't

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,149
include file that was just BAM this is

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,940
cool I can organize my stuff you can see

00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:55,860
all the old people like yeah yeah all

00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,269
you new fancy JavaScript people you like

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:03,149
why's this so far anyways so here's my

00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,010
SVG file and I can even go into the hand

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:07,710
edit it that's like when you get into do

00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,120
this it is pretty amazing um and another

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,710
thing i doing in this example just to

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,230
show this off it's like normally when we

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,820
include a field you would include that

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,740
whole field and that would then be like

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,330
culture another template if you just

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,980
want to get the data out without the

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,350
attribute without all that whistle and

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,529
bang in this example I just need the I

00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,720
need the exact language because prism

00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:29,159
uses this language variable to figure

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,470
out how to put color code stuff so if

00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,929
its CSS file is a gem file if it's a PHP

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,179
file or HTML file so I only need the

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:37,769
role value I don't need anything else

00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,080
when that I could do content field

00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:43,049
underscore coat underscore language at

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,639
my fields take the first out of the

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:46,470
array and then just give me the mark-up

00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:48,389
then it will only give me that data

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,950
there's probably somebody who's going to

00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:52,500
say that is something something but we

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,880
can get this data out right now anything

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,620
else you want to put out at there's

00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,510
multiple values and so forth we cannot

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,220
get them out this way and we cannot get

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,899
them out with attributes and so forth on

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,510
it so you can have accessibility issues

00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:05,279
around this so it's not always do it

00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,720
this way I kind of like it with it's

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,789
just like a field name or something like

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,470
that I need where don't need to agree

00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:15,750
use a markup components how good are we

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,779
on time right now and only event for

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,700
half an hour good so a people kind of

00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,909
following this whole concept of like

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,740
rethinking like hey my templates deliver

00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:28,490
my template folder but I organize

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,720
everything inside like separate elements

00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,279
good thing is I have one more example

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,690
and they were guys you like I'm not even

00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,159
going to do live coding we do Christians

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,389
and so forth but it's a people like

00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,309
following this whole concept

00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:40,929
it kind of makes sense right that's deep

00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,059
that's this is one of the beauties

00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:46,029
around Drupal 8 which I begin to really

00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:47,709
enjoy by building it is you get these

00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:50,440
idea in your head because everything is

00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:52,479
a this is back to the whole visibility

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,849
thing we want to build systems that is

00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:56,889
usually that's easy for us to use and

00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:59,169
especially of this thing that is easy

00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:01,899
for me to debug in six years or four

00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:03,129
years or so in my example 20 minutes

00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,779
after I've written a line of code I

00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:07,809
cannot remember what I did because I

00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:13,539
moved on to somewhere else so this is

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:15,519
kind of the IDS board all right so one

00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:17,320
of the things the number one question

00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,179
I've gotten besides of how am i doing

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,159
this and this is people hunting me down

00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:22,749
on Twitter and Facebook and all kinds of

00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,269
other players like more than how do i

00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:27,249
how do i add a class into my menu links

00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:29,320
how to do this with many leaves because

00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:30,820
menus a kind of essential for a website

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,799
like we kind of use them to navigate

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,709
around but when you look at them they

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,809
kind of pain in the ass to do anything

00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:40,269
with it's just have that links thing and

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,549
you can't do anything with it and I

00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:43,959
begin to joke around with SVG and so in

00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:45,879
my head I was like wait a minute if I

00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:49,539
can do all this in trick I wonder if I

00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:52,359
can put in an SVG file as my link how to

00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:54,219
do that and not break you exactly

00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:57,759
there's one person here in the front

00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:59,139
will go like do you think you think this

00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,769
is going to be awesome what I

00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:04,479
going to show now ok so this started out

00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:07,209
as a holy crest like three weeks ago

00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:08,919
because and Drupal does things also

00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:10,389
based on security so suddenly now we

00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:12,639
have the front end up versus the

00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:15,849
security team that is always a nice

00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:18,399
fight right so what I wanted to do is I

00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:20,349
want to put in SVG files inside of my

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,539
links and I want to still have a link to

00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:24,609
be active when you click on it it needs

00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:26,919
to get these is active class is active

00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:29,259
is added by JavaScript by tubule I do

00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,659
not know why something about speed or

00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:34,029
something something that's how Google's

00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:37,089
mainu work so I started out by rewriting

00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:38,379
Google's menus completely that was a

00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:41,019
good idea right because now I have

00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:42,849
hard-coded markup inside of my template

00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:46,169
and I cannot move by elements around and

00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:50,440
and then we begin to play around with it

00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:51,100
36 hours ago we fixed this issue and

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,960
this is going to

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,669
little bit advanced but it's so

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,130
cool so let's see here what we're doing

00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:58,720
it is so this is my website by the way

00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,610
and yes it may be going to be broken on

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,200
some sites I've not had the time to fix

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,840
all these things because we wanted to

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,970
inject HPG inside of links and not break

00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:13,210
Drupal so let's see what this does so

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,789
here's my menu and you know you can put

00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,049
a mouse over and put stuff out and I can

00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:18,610
eat this is just to prove that this is

00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,020
not hard coded there's nothing as good

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,280
as like giving an example it's just hard

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,610
coded everything to be like well this is

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,230
how we maybe can do it in three years so

00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,850
what I'm doing now is I'm actually doing

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,789
this kind of crazy thing because I want

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:33,250
to be able to like give my my icon

00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:35,860
surname and put them in so I put it in a

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,510
fancy title and something and I do this

00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,940
pipe I do a pipe and then I put in the

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:44,350
name and now we can save it and I've

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:47,650
moved it around and let's see how let's

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:49,480
see if it actually works tada alright so

00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,780
I've not broken the menus i'm still

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,490
using the menus as they go along let's

00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,610
take next little example so let's look

00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:02,640
at the mark-up what's happening in here

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:05,890
here's my link sale I tagging it damn

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,590
i'm using a use file this is even sexier

00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:11,230
SVG stuff so now my file of all of my

00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:13,990
icons is up on this server and they're

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,120
now cast this makes all the developers

00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:18,070
like whew thank you for not adding six

00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,900
thousand SVG files so it's yes here's my

00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:28,240
one file and now can we use it all over

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:30,220
my side so we like let's see Shh here we

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,750
go so what's going on here up there is

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,460
my is active class is still and you can

00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,080
see the link is pink because I thought

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,580
that would be a good you always use hot

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,950
pink as my chest cutter for anything

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:44,559
it's the best color ever and why because

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:47,200
it makes my themes fancy and so I have

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,500
is active class up on it I have an SVG

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,260
in line directly inside of the link and

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,059
even better I have a pure CSS tooltip so

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,860
now I need to add data attributes in I

00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:00,070
need to add some custom classes in and I

00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:02,200
need to inject and SVG files using use

00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,450
not even just injecting judgment it

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,750
includes because if you do an include a

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,510
break

00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,850
and you do not have to file and click I

00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,800
can't find the file it will it will

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,050
terminate that template that calls it so

00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,760
suddenly my menu disappeared Oh like

00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,260
what happened oh I cannot figure out how

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,320
to spell my own things I'm an idiot

00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,210
because rocket Oh sometimes it's hard

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,800
for me to figure that out anyways so

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,530
let's go over and see we have menu icons

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,720
those bad boys these are the icons look

00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,100
up cutie looks even better here's the

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,440
file for them as you can see there's an

00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,480
ID outside of each of them so here's how

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,010
it's going to go here's my data that

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,510
comes out my description i'm gonna use

00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:41,410
my description and put in and identify

00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:43,630
on it so my day identifier is here and

00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,180
just doing a pipe on it cost normally

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,950
you're everybody in Google will be like

00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,450
well you wanna add like an icon to start

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,460
rhythm you should really create a module

00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,870
and put it into a module and put up to

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,970
Google cause or other people can use it

00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,800
oh thank you but I'm gonna

00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,020
deadline and I'm sitting in an airport

00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,090
and I'm about to push this stuff and how

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,130
many hours is going to take me to figure

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,590
out how to write through blade code push

00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,690
that stuff up we're understanding how

00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:10,300
object orientated coding works when I

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,340
just want to take a path pipe

00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,440
that and put it in and get done

00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,850
with my life right so that's what I'm

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,820
going to do is somebody go like bird you

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,560
cannot do they're like I can't Oh what

00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,889
are you going to do ain't gonna stop me

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,770
publishing my site anyways so here we go

00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:29,320
the idea is I take this like after the

00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,210
pipe and I then use my menu SVG file and

00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,770
I can use that as an IP so now even

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,179
begins like put in the name and then

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:39,129
we'll find that name it'll put out that

00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:40,659
icon exactly one person got it I've been

00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:43,030
a little bit excited about this the last

00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,740
three days and collected can do this

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,379
stuff we can do this stuff so here it is

00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,780
so here I call bucket and you got market

00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:52,540
down there so we got like hold that

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,520
party not the file so how we're going to

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,850
do that well it's simple you know we

00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,410
split up we take the ID we know we call

00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,790
it on SVG file we create the market we

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,400
sneaks that into treat because we had to

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:05,500
sneak it in because security somebody

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,330
thinks that SVG files by default are

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,910
insecure even if I put them up on my own

00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,650
server it's in my own git repository and

00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,720
that's where combo still ignore to

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,370
secure geez you that was the first the

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,650
first reaction I got on this when I put

00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,250
the code out I thought I'll get like the

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,130
front end

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:26,110
of the world go like damn this is sweet

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:27,760
no SVG files it's a security issue like

00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,520
thank you for that thank you for killing

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,380
my mojo on it so here's the here's the

00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,500
whole file on it it a little bit

00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,410
complicated but this is where it's at so

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,760
we start up here we split up our

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,500
variables and they create three new

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,900
variables and one of those variables i

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,310
create the whole markup part that takes

00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,860
all this stuff and put in the name and

00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:50,470
put in the elements that are put inside

00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,320
of my link then inside of my link now i

00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,770
do an inline template we create a trick

00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,180
template inside of the template yes I

00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,980
didn't get it at first either like what

00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,040
the is dis Lowry and loud like he's

00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,750
finished like you don't even understand

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,310
but we have a trick simply inside of a

00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,440
trick save it now we can begin to pass

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,390
in whatever we want so sorry security

00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,740
guys but I found a loophole and here's

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,320
one of the things this is how we work

00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:16,240
you know and why do we work this way

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,160
because i have an end result the end

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,530
result is the layout is this sign of

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,420
this my client do not care about all

00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,160
these other issues I don't get paid

00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,660
unless I get this stuff and I do know

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,510
that if we break it all down and this

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,220
security and stuff the server burns well

00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,260
then we're gonna have a whole nother

00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,090
issue but if the first thing I imagine

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,800
when I go into Jubal is while Google

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,630
can't do these things I probably gonna

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,700
leave Drupal again I mean how many fun

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:44,020
tenders have been happy in Drupal 7 they

00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,610
begin a raise of hands yes exactly why

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,140
because you could not do what we wanted

00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,700
to do so it doesn't matter all these

00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,290
things doesn't matter your first

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,910
experience with Drupal 7 is this smack

00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,440
in the face and it's some kind of

00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:57,520
technical description of why you cannot

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,320
do this like that pretty please

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,780
with sugar on top give them my

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,160
coda lipid do my job yes I have six

00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,740
million different browsers out there I

00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,570
need to fix so sorry for the rant but

00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,610
we're doing in that template and then

00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,920
down here we do a vendor and then we add

00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,690
in all of these special classes and day

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,630
that stuff it's going to come up bigger

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,460
so first of all here is my split I do a

00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:21,280
variable set description I take item

00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,990
original dings get description then I do

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,400
these trig function split and then I

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,730
search for the pattern I want to split

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,010
on a search for two spaces and a pipe

00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:31,720
feel enough then I take the link title

00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,230
that's description dot 0 that's the

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,900
first part

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:42,250
the pipe and then description dot one

00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:44,440
that's my icon ID all it yeah speed is a

00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,660
trig function so every time we do a pipe

00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,220
on something you can do crazy stuff with

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,100
it it's basic here's my variable named

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,180
pipe make awesome and pretty that's kind

00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,500
of like and then you can pass it it

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,390
depends on all kinds of stuff and you're

00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,580
pretty much every pee its pee function

00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:00,130
you can actually type in here you can do

00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:03,310
like make this make this variable

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,810
uppercase remove not sure if you can

00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,670
actually do regular expressions on it

00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,109
but I'm oh yeah okay we can actually do

00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:12,520
regular expressions on it so we can let

00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:17,290
go Cove that some people can this

00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:19,210
particular Dana up here cannot i have to

00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:24,430
i actually the first theme i built in

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:26,830
drupal 4.5 4.7 saw it to get menus menu

00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,240
link no menu images the images

00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,430
intimating that way back when we did

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,040
like sliding doors and stuff anybody

00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:35,470
remember those good days yeah image

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,150
images directly into the menu good times

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,550
now we're kind of back now it's just

00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:42,220
these sexy SVG files to do that in two

00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,990
will 4.27 I had to do hook regular

00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:48,430
expression under on the whole menu

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:50,890
structure yes we come far away anyways

00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,930
so here's why I can name right rocket

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,730
and take that so this is basically what

00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,280
we do we just take this thing and now I

00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,200
can begin to passing Peter my infuser

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,670
can passing data I can pass the stuff in

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,380
without writing this thing yes I know

00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,020
the end user could not figure this out

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:07,570
well if I explain it to him and the end

00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,460
user in this case is me so I will put up

00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,530
a little sticky note back on back home

00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,690
on my computer modem remember the first

00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:16,119
part is your icon because apparently I

00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,310
cannot remember that right anyways he'll

00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,920
go to the next one the SVG i can so i

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,560
have my my smile span with a class on

00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,340
have its Rajee view box to show how big

00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,090
it's going to be in the neighborhood

00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:31,780
used link and then x link href and then

00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:33,430
the path to my whole to my SVG file this

00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,340
is simplified because the file name is

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,260
so long they couldn't see it but if you

00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,030
grab my coat it's all up and github by

00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,560
the way I kind of need to remove the

00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,020
icons because I think their licensing

00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,010
but we can go to that later on then I

00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,410
take my HP g icon ID and I used

00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:55,420
and then I just print out my title clean

00:39:48,410 --> 00:40:00,710
and sweet mm-hmm all right let's and

00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:03,290
here we go so and then my SVG is going

00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,790
to use so this is BG file calling that

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,560
in does that make sense by the way you

00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,200
have an SVG file has all of these IDs

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,240
and then with using use I can like pipe

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,430
in and call it directly it doesn't work

00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,350
on ie of course because that's how life

00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,840
is there is a there's a JavaScript

00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,250
library that can fix that and this is

00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,690
just on my side and I was kind of you

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,340
know what I don't care i'm just

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,720
going to walk this stuff and this is all

00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,150
if somebody goes like well why don't you

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,580
just put it in with the clean CSS that

00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:31,400
is not the whole issue here the issue is

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:34,520
i can inject SVG tie directly into my

00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,190
menus that makes me happy and then

00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:39,110
inside of my in my template so what i'm

00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,240
doing here this is where it tricky right

00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,610
you can see i do a variable set menu

00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,590
link i do type in line template and then

00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,900
inside the template i has my HP g icon

00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:50,030
the SVG i can we just created and then i

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,670
do a context for the SVG icon and now

00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:55,310
i'm going to get it in whoo here's the

00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:58,400
next step this is the link link menu

00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:01,220
link pound render pound mentor now takes

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,900
this menu link and vendors that through

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,880
Google's normal way of doing it she will

00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,950
just inject all of this stuff into it

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,450
then I have my item that URL which is

00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,550
just the URL for whatever we've got a

00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,620
cool dislike menu stuff and then the

00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,330
next thing is inside of the variable you

00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,210
can see I have a curly bracket there to

00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:25,310
class colon and then I put in the

00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:30,620
classes I need what so I will come to

00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:32,810
that because security they basically and

00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,580
we don't in in front end we don't call

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,580
it cockblockin we call it towed blogging

00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,400
and that was kind of what happened got

00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,200
to come to that in just a second and so

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,790
here you know I put in this specific

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,290
class I want to put in so if you want to

00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,000
put specific classes into your menu

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,500
that's a link just hey I just want need

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,760
this class in this menu that's how I

00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,310
going to do it the next thing I'm doing

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,590
I'm doing data desk balloon I put in my

00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,660
link title a balloon if you go and

00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,030
search for balloon that CSS balloon is

00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,930
like this sweet little CSS library that

00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,910
just adds but

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:04,130
two links and stuff in it if it has the

00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,510
data test balloon it will take that data

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,430
and put it into that little balloon you

00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,190
saw on my menus came out black and then

00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:13,220
I also do the position for it and chose

00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:16,070
it it should go down I would prefer

00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:18,470
though to do it this way instead just

00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,270
doing a set available passing mark up

00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,830
and push it in the problem is that we

00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:24,290
have a white list for what we accept

00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,970
through markup and SVG is not one of

00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,520
them the reason for that is like if you

00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,290
upload if you have SVG uploaded that's

00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,060
like a gaping security hole it's kind of

00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,620
like saying hey just upload your

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,270
JavaScript you outside we're just going

00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,190
to execute it because what kind of dumb

00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:39,140
things could you do so yes there is a

00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:41,390
security issue I'm not gonna like not

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,400
accept that but here it is on my own

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,770
server it's me who created the file it's

00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,630
hard coded in line this is not a

00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,490
security anymore I mean even that I did

00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:54,290
get this one from the security and it

00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,910
the answer as always is no this is a

00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,560
true one of the other points is like

00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,090
when we do these kind of things by the

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,270
weighted that'll all that crazy

00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,710
that I've made any kind of sense kind of

00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,180
the good thing is you can take it you

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,770
can feel and you can play around with it

00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,450
and that's kind of this thing that we

00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,460
really should begin to do this tuple

00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:13,520
world like do all these crazy things as

00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,740
we want to do them gasps no the

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,660
basically the thing I did you know take

00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,190
a description spit it out I move it

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,440
around play around with it and figure

00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,880
out how to get it in the big hurdle here

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,980
was like I could not just do regular

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,230
Google stuff to it I needed to create an

00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,150
inline template so Jubal it didn't even

00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,520
know what kind of mike i found this

00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:34,280
basically a whole how to inject stuff

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,070
that's kind of bad we need to create

00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,840
these tools so that's kind of the one of

00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,550
the things that i think we really need

00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,700
to work around to figure out how to do

00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:45,830
better so i see the theme system as our

00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,720
system that is how we as fun dennis can

00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,840
begin to build stuff to think stuff and

00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,400
and make it work and so we need to

00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,630
figure find these things so we don't

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,150
constantly block ourselves so as the

00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,890
last thing let's talk about the future

00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,070
this is like just crazy examples of what

00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:06,350
you can do to me adding injecting stuff

00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,940
into the links and controlling the links

00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:09,380
and figure out what goes on to them has

00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,210
been like kind of a little bit of a Holy

00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,550
Grail quest for me actually for almost

00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:15,350
10 years I'm so sad I couldn't find

00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,900
site-built 10 years ago with the regular

00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,580
expressions of the menu because back

00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:22,130
then why would I use you know that whole

00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,500
github kind of thing if you as he'll my

00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,750
code works the first time and stuff

00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:31,010
there yeah yeah I'm the kind of

00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:35,390
developer who you know I Misha once and

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,680
I caught 25 times so it was a good thing

00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,530
yes there's people here have been

00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:41,420
working maybe like this we know um

00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,100
here's the thing i saw that you saw some

00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,380
of the trees note this morning and i saw

00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:48,500
it hey we want to have preprocessor into

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,120
core and i was sitting over in the green

00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,770
room i think it was a good thing that i

00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,120
was there was only me and Davina a

00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,160
German developer in the room that was

00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,870
there because the level of cursing that

00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,910
came out of my mouth came up to whole

00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:02,900
new levels here's the reason for it and

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:05,990
four years ago we had seriously talks

00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:08,480
about pushing can anybody remember 960

00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,790
grid system all right how would that be

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,340
that was forced down your throat Andrew

00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:15,410
blade now we've been fun right because

00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,030
that was future proof because the things

00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:21,290
we write right now is future proof

00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:23,810
forever forever ever no they're not I

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,060
mean I've been a big fan of pre

00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:28,010
processes for years I don't use

00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,870
preprocessors anymore why not because I

00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:34,930
figured out I don't need them because I

00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:37,340
don't build websites for 246 anymore I

00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:39,260
built google sites in Peru blade where I

00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,030
can control my classes I can build my

00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,280
stuff in another way if we begin to

00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,990
inject epic kind of new kool-aid camp

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,120
that comes in we're beginning to make

00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,890
some seriously dumb mistakes what we

00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,350
need to do in their futures we need to

00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,910
clear everything out so we can build

00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,620
whatever the thing is that we want to

00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,330
build on top of it not the other way

00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,640
around not putting new stuff in the

00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:01,100
first thing is I put it as a comment

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,310
here to trees it says how about we also

00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:06,950
put 996 TGS into cone now we are at it I

00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:08,990
might add a little bit is it called snog

00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:11,120
years it's ashley this kind of company

00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:14,600
is so here comes nathan smith the author

00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,190
of 960 he goes like what no it's always

00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,320
possible period sure this is a joke

00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:22,490
right and we talked back and thought he

00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,530
got like okay pound small call small

00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,180
cone was a thing we had up six or seven

00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,960
years ago the whole idea is like making

00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,000
Google as

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,710
as possible out of the box so we can

00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,960
build on top of it that's kind of what

00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,940
we want to do in the front end and

00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,880
that's been like the the whole concept

00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,580
of this so i can say just now that i

00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,560
will use every inch of my body to make

00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,359
sure that absolutely no element of cool

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,609
eights get into the front end I will

00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:49,490
battle it I will burn it down I will

00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:51,740
find my ex and yes I have an ex I will

00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,020
find a Viking ship and we will go to

00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,089
 town wherever it needs to be

00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,220
removed from because every time we put

00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:00,230
these things and how many use underscore

00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:04,250
you know understall we put into jubilate

00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:07,910
call sweet now we have that to move

00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:10,460
around contact module wonderful thing to

00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:14,180
move around the discussion board hey do

00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:16,849
we still have vote anyways we cannot put

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,320
whatever new kool aid in into coal as we

00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:21,320
need to do it because then we need to

00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,109
maintain it drupal 7 was said to be what

00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:28,520
a two-year release cycle Google seven

00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:30,109
came out January 2011 my watch don't

00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,290
have years on it but i'm pretty sure

00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:35,570
it's five or six years ago and drupal 8

00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,250
is going to be around for a long time we

00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,470
are not just going to put whatever you

00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,330
think right now is the solution for

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:43,970
everything the front end constantly

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:45,560
changes that's the only thing we know we

00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,300
also know we do not know what kind of

00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,339
browsers we are going to theme this

00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,339
stuff for so we also need to be able to

00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:54,859
change that so every time every time we

00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:57,050
put in any idea this is how you're going

00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:59,180
to do it we are going to fail so if you

00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:01,160
want to build whatever this end user

00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,470
experience is going to be and you think

00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:08,300
you can just ignore the fondant here's

00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:10,760
your Jason feed work with that and with

00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,250
that and that like kind of

00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,290
comment on it no it's more like hey we

00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,030
need to think above this thing I know

00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:19,130
that as an end user you hope to get

00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:20,510
these easy solutions if we can't build

00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,460
them it's also going to build these

00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:24,500
things at the end of the day and if you

00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:29,210
give me like this chunk of markup I

00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:31,609
can't build anything on it so that was

00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:37,160
my first 45 minutes of friends can we do

00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:39,000
45 more no here's the thing it has been

00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,980
an enjoyment

00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,690
for years this is this is actually

00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,600
couple years ago this is jen Lambton is

00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,460
in the room jen is here somewhere you

00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,680
find her go and hug her she's like one

00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,990
of the initial check is this day we got

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,290
we got tricky inchicore she was very

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:56,520
happy I had a session and a bad camp

00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:59,160
that year's called the and Christina

00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,170
which was an full 60-minute full on

00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,000
grant that yelled at everybody in the

00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:05,460
room by triple seven sucked ass and what

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,130
we needed to change I went from being

00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,810
the anchor it tema to the grown-ass man

00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,250
walking tall chew off my boo my head

00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:14,600
like take a teacher because i had a

00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:16,620
little tea in my eye yes sensible viking

00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,450
this is the group that i've been working

00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,040
on this so far a bunch of disputed we

00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,440
need more people we need more people to

00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,660
come and help us out I'm all of this

00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,320
stuff we've been building has been it's

00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:29,970
very much uphill constantly I don't feel

00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,650
that the front end gets the respect in

00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:34,260
our community that we should get I get

00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,750
 pissed off when I see these kind

00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,280
of surveys coming out and is like at the

00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,450
end of the day it's also have to build

00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,030
this stuff and you're not giving me the

00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:44,910
tools for it I know that maybe people

00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:47,610
thought that I've been there I don't

00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:50,130
hate develops I love my develops I love

00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,810
the fact what they're building I hate

00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,280
that I cannot build the beautiful

00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,990
product that we should build for them

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,790
and that's the thing we need to change

00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,310
and we can only do that by getting more

00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:01,230
people in so you know come and join our

00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:04,610
little army this is me and Joelle on our

00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:07,530
weekly tweak Thursday meetings we do and

00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:08,820
we do a skype call where we sit and

00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,290
discuss where we're going to be where

00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,420
we're going to be at how things are

00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:14,550
going around we have done another thing

00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,110
which I got a lot of flak for you know

00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,360
that how everybody else in the world

00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,130
they're using iOS CSD like the main

00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:24,330
communication communication channel

00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:26,100
because our seas just ace right if you

00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:27,810
are developer with like 10 20 years on

00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:30,270
your back you know IRC is just the

00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:32,280
um here's the thing we tried then I

00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:34,050
wonder if these designers and funding

00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,300
people as using this thing called slack

00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:40,380
or there may be is let's set up a slack

00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,380
channel I got a little bit of slack for

00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,230
it yeah i've been i've been having that

00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:48,000
in my head for a week but I care anyways

00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,140
we set up the slack channel we got a

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,880
little bit of for it because it

00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,780
this is outside the normal world this is

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,420
a commercial product that does this

00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,710
I really don't care this is about haces

00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,780
Londoners having a place where we can

00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,970
communicate so this is all slack channel

00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,640
you jump in on this a drupal Google

00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:05,200
trick that slack that hero crap combi go

00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,720
in there and you just put in your

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,400
credentials and you go there's like 10

00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,860
20 different rooms this is where we keep

00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,210
the majority of all the discussions

00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:16,030
they're like hey can you help me out

00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:17,290
with this we are still using IRSC we

00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,240
still have that channel we have not

00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,850
abandoned that we just know that by

00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,520
default there's a ton of special new

00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,860
people coming in that uses slag instead

00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,630
so let's not ignore that as a fact else

00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:32,350
Iowa see is the place we are also

00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:34,570
hanging out we did plan this night to do

00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:37,720
like a front end meetup kind of thing

00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:41,500
somewhere but as usual at rubicon like

00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:43,720
fixing anything and I got I might have

00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,460
used a week of my life to figure out how

00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,490
to inject SVG iconic it's a true

00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:52,780
foucault to a to blink and so we kind of

00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:54,670
is canceling that thing but find find me

00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,050
I would help you pointing out to the

00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:01,930
right people doing especially during

00:51:56,050 --> 00:52:03,550
lunch and and let's talk because this

00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:05,770
front end we've finally at a place where

00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,720
we can actually build it the way we want

00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,100
to build it and to me that's very

00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,380
exciting but we need more people to come

00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,210
and help out cuz it's else I mean at

00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,040
some point you get a little bit tired of

00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,860
working uphill or pillow uphill all the

00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:21,000
time so with that and ten minutes left

00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,000
any questions

00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:43,869
all right so no questions we just mean I

00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:46,450
there was a question see I'm so happy

00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:49,119
you asked me that question um first of

00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:52,630
all use twitter is a thing i personally

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:55,509
use a lot use pound drupal trick to like

00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:58,299
yell stuff out and questions comments

00:52:55,509 --> 00:53:00,999
feedback please sent them to me if this

00:52:58,299 --> 00:53:04,089
does not make sense whatever it was how

00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:05,979
you feel about it a modern DK the happy

00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:09,299
themer you can hear them all happiness

00:53:05,979 --> 00:53:13,630
right my slides is on tinyurl.com

00:53:09,299 --> 00:53:15,279
theming desti eight deaths nola this is

00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,019
this whole slide set is up there the

00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:19,329
video is not up there i am going to pop

00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:21,069
this all of this code on my brand new

00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,390
block when i got it to work in all the

00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:24,279
browsers because now i have time for

00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:27,039
that i'm gonna post that hopefully

00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:28,660
during this conference i'm gonna keep on

00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,720
posting more and more these things kiss

00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:34,930
a lot of this is new thinking and at

00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,519
this point as cutter our core committer

00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,680
said that more than you do know that

00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:40,450
you're kind of like our idea man it's

00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,150
kind of out of my brain stuff comes from

00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:45,190
which is kind of terrifying because you

00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,690
know only my head i mean we need more

00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,999
people to come in and help out think

00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,049
discuss these things playing around with

00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:52,569
them especially when you have the

00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:55,719
discussions on friday doing coach

00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:57,219
sprints really want to see you all there

00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:58,479
coming in and helping out and helping

00:53:57,219 --> 00:53:59,950
others also just sitting down and

00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:01,989
discussing where do we want to push this

00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,579
what our wish is what do we work with

00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:07,029
right now how can we change these things

00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:09,519
all of these things is important coming

00:54:07,029 --> 00:54:10,779
up to me cottage oil whoever else have

00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,670
been active in this and actually

00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:15,489
commenting on these things means a lot

00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:19,269
to us because a lot of this coding is

00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:21,789
done at very late night hours very much

00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:22,569
alone just you in front of my laptop and

00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:25,059
figure out actually means something

00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:27,400
means something to us so pretty please

00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:29,410
come with some feedback to it a couple

00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,229
of moldings i have here is the theme

00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:36,339
guide the standard for CSS snacks and

00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:38,729
the trick documentation there's coming

00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:41,349
out a new bunch of also of tools to use

00:54:38,729 --> 00:54:43,359
which I unfortunately didn't have time

00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:46,150
to because I got banned it up increases

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:50,779
keynote but it did not put in

00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:53,390
so this is the same slide haha anyways

00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:56,390
and with death and actually as far as i

00:54:53,390 --> 00:55:01,970
can see seven minutes left five minutes

00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:04,759
left any last minute questions the

00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:07,640
inline templates and okay so the idea in

00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:10,759
90 m is basically you create and you can

00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:14,180
render that template so you can you can

00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:15,529
put other you can kind of like it's kind

00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,029
of having one similar having another

00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:19,730
template then you whatever comes into

00:55:17,029 --> 00:55:20,990
that template you can then I work around

00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:23,119
that that's why I did that whole

00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:25,420
horrible hack by putting all the the

00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:29,180
SPG's things and so it begins to come

00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:31,519
and inline templates that didn't make

00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:35,089
sense maybe I don't even understand it

00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:45,440
but I made it work sorry for that other

00:55:35,089 --> 00:55:46,910
questions and so what do you do about

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,650
the administration team one of the

00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:52,339
things we really have not worked on

00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:54,740
Andrew Palladius is forms forms is kind

00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:56,630
of tricky to work with and I'm sorry for

00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,299
that but we only had that much time we

00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:02,029
chose to fix the fields first forms is

00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:03,410
definitely then it's in forms and

00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:05,180
component-based theming with a new

00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,920
concept bilious and especially Johnny

00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,450
helping up in working on it's coming is

00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,789
that one of the big things we're

00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,980
expecting to see soon I personally have

00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:14,539
forms as my number one goal to fix so we

00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:24,099
can begin to reblock the end user

00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:24,099
experience yeah

00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:34,109
so so the question is what ever think

00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,029
about contributing is your back and

00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:38,760
Google seven you lost download a country

00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:41,099
module to fix stuff the thing is in

00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,019
Drupal 7 we needed to have all these

00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:45,000
base themes to clean out all the stuff

00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:46,559
that came out of Drupal I created one

00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,049
John ALP and I created on there's like a

00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,309
whole ton of them base team Andrew blade

00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:53,039
is a complete other thing because they

00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:54,960
do not need to clean out and a base

00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:58,650
theme like bootstrap is just going to do

00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:00,420
bootstraps thing and the themes and what

00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:02,309
I hope to see is we actually gonna get

00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,170
pretty themes so instead of they just

00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:06,630
leak here's how I modify all my markup

00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:09,569
is going to be here is my pretty pretty

00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:11,970
ice cream theme that looks pretty on all

00:57:09,569 --> 00:57:13,829
these browsers and has this design so we

00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:16,549
can actually go back and have design

00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:18,990
themes that's my secret little dream

00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:20,789
which I know a lot of people would

00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,380
really like because hey I want to have

00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:23,990
my can i get my site to look pretty

00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,279
really fast and just keep going and

00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:28,650
that's kind of a thing we can finally

00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:30,299
begin to do and the other things when

00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,490
you start your theme basically what i

00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:35,069
normally do i just take like stable or

00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,289
classy i cloned that whole folder i move

00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:39,599
with oh i rename the few files need to

00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:42,210
be renamed done another job then i go to

00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,250
challenge that's kind of the my normal

00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,990
workflow so I don't even think about

00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,430
there's a base theme I just think about

00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:49,289
like here's all my template files

00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:51,150
because that is the kind of number one

00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:53,609
thing in Drupal 8 it's everything is a

00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:54,809
file and there's a ton of them no

00:57:53,609 --> 00:57:55,890
matter what you do and if you don't

00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:59,400
organize them in some way you're going

00:57:55,890 --> 00:58:00,839
to be like this is an issue and it was

00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,089
kind of the joke was like when we killed

00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:04,680
the last theme functional like so in

00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:06,839
about six months everybody gonna hate me

00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,119
because we have 200 template files and

00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,440
what they're going to do with them

00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,869
hopefully this is an inspiration of how

00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,390
you can be thinking it's kind of pre

00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:17,460
sinking the whole component thing I

00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:19,589
don't even know if this is a component I

00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,089
called it the component because that was

00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:23,579
the name in my head so maybe we need to

00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:25,470
give it another name I don't know know

00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:28,190
where this gonna go on I hope this was

00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,190
oh yes

00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:39,849
no so here's the thing yeah I have I

00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:41,589
have no idea how people who you i don't

00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,969
so here's thing I don't hate hate says I

00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:45,609
just figured out that my life got easier

00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:47,559
without using and gulping all these two

00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:50,799
hundred other tools like hey I just ride

00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:53,890
my trick file on my CSS and I'm I'm done

00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:55,569
hey I'm happy I don't have a grunt built

00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,299
that suddenly that gets destroyed

00:58:55,569 --> 00:59:00,549
because some some developer ragequit

00:58:58,299 --> 00:59:02,049
somewhere and remove his repositories

00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:04,690
and then suddenly nothing works anymore

00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:06,940
note world yes that was a cheap cheap

00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,579
staff and note I know but hey she's like

00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,900
what can I do no I do think that the all

00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,579
the things that sass and pre-process

00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,559
have done over the years is amazing it

00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:16,749
has pushed away were thinking CSS it

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,160
pushed away what we can do is the reason

00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:19,329
we're going to get variables into the

00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,459
browser now we actually have them

00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:23,049
Firefox have had them for a year CSS

00:59:21,459 --> 00:59:26,349
variables is available now the last

00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:28,059
chrome which is amazing it's not

00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:29,079
available yet in Safari we're waiting

00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:31,119
for that it's going to come at some

00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,650
point and that's like one of the reason

00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,199
I'm like hey i don't think i'm gonna use

00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:36,729
sass in a year maybe you are built at

00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:38,259
your own way that's the thing we can do

00:59:36,729 --> 00:59:39,489
in jubilate now you can build your stuff

00:59:38,259 --> 00:59:41,170
as you want if you think this is like

00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:42,699
hey mode this is too complicated i'm

00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:44,440
gonna build all my stash things this way

00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:47,079
or that way i'm gonna do it in another

00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,079
way go and do that I know that Johnny

00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:53,049
open on thursday has his new version of

00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,459
his sin theme which is he's doing things

00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:55,930
I don't even understand what he's doing

00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:57,489
he's also rethinking the whole thing and

00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:59,170
that's the thing we can do now we can be

00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:01,959
think the way we are building our stuff

00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:03,969
and as we do that we can build actually

01:00:01,959 --> 01:00:06,699
an amazing front end instead of this

01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:08,140
media call kind of like I don't like to

01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:09,729
work in the front end I want to have it

01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,940
to be a wonderful experience for all of

01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:15,719
us so did that answer the crazy no did I

01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,719
just begin to rent

01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:26,550
yeah and you kind of can't yeah yeah

01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:29,100
yeah I know it's going to be a

01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:33,110
completeness so it says fanboys I showed

01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:37,530
your technique with you I am superior oh

01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:41,340
man oh this is all recorded right man

01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:43,110
I'm I'm not trying to remove says I'm

01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:47,040
just saying that I live a simpler life

01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:48,480
now it's kind of like you know yeah I've

01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,190
used to ask for it for years i think it

01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,770
was wonderful but here's the thing i

01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:54,120
begin to drink old fashions right like

01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:56,970
old-fashioned is the best drink in the

01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:59,490
world you got a glass you got a big

01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:00,930
 rock you got bourbon got a

01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:03,390
little bit of sugar a little bit of

01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:06,630
bitter and then you know orange peel and

01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:08,520
if you're really fancy a cherry BAM when

01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:10,080
old-fashioned came back when they really

01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,900
begin to start up back anything in

01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,550
nineteen twenty one of the reason they

01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,080
the Barton is begin to make them again

01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:17,880
was they were so child of making these

01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,650
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger

01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:23,430
cocktails so they kind of want to like

01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:26,670
go back to just do the simple clean like

01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:29,160
drink that just works out and that's

01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:30,450
kind of my thing I'm on right now I'm

01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,050
kind of like this we go back to the

01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:35,460
roots funnily enough the CSS framework

01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:38,070
I'm fighting right now is called

01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,660
old-fashioned I call my technique get

01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:44,300
this you know how its modern when you

01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:44,300
use sass this is postmodern front end

01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,510
and I know yes that they had a

01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:53,790
bothersome guys even coming up with a

01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:55,350
hashtag for it then so if something

01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:57,300
suddenly explodes and I'm in the middle

01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:59,880
of it some of this is kind of dumb it's

01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,260
yeah it is but it's just rethinking some

01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,610
of these ways and we can do that in

01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,110
Drupal 8 that's the beauty of it like

01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:06,420
hey let me do it this way let me do it

01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:10,950
that way do that yeah pomo what's the

01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:12,930
word it's pomo I caramel but we're it's

01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:21,740
going to come out I like more questions

01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:21,740
or should I let you all go there may be

01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:32,130
no so the library is what the libraries

01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,080
do is that they you can like built them

01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:37,620
in and they should be aggregated based

01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,240
on base or theme or layout that whole

01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,430
smacks way they should be aggregated

01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,770
that way there is going to be issues

01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:45,420
with this I know by default because that

01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,610
was on how we thought the system from

01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:50,040
the ground up and the reason I'm doing

01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,570
these things is also to figure out like

01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,680
how can we build these things the best

01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:54,570
way because front-end nurse will

01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,420
constantly come up with new ideas to fix

01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:58,620
stuff and we need to figure out how we

01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,870
could do in the best way without

01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:03,240
breaking Drupal and making our dev up

01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:04,140
boys and girls angry at us because then

01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,790
they're going to be like nope I'm not

01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,860
going to publish that it'll be like well

01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:10,200
we kind of then you have this whole

01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:11,850
yelling thing and I kind of I actually

01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,830
just want to be happy right and just

01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:15,150
when I walk down the street don't have

01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:20,070
to find a develop and threaten him with

01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:22,650
my ex no but they did you get aggregated

01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:24,330
and they do get compiled and that is as

01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:26,010
a whole thing that Drupal does for us so

01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:28,470
as soon as you go the CSS aggregation

01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:31,110
jsf grazing in in case this is out for

01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:33,300
you so and the the whole thing about

01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:34,950
adding all the files definite you add a

01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,020
library for them each times I so if you

01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:39,540
rebuild them to rule if you have like a

01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,850
form CSS file a pajama and put in the

01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:43,710
phone template i call my form library

01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:45,660
and put that in drupal doesn't care

01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,250
because it's 6,000 times because it's

01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,920
already there that's kind of the whole

01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:51,300
idea behind the libraries and if you

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,910
have a module that says hey if you use

01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,440
that that library you can then do

01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,649
something else with it or your theme can

01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,059
even do that as well

01:03:57,649 --> 01:04:02,609
David Hernandez wrote a blog article

01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:04,849
about it blog article an article about

01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:09,239
libraries and what you can do with it

01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:11,399
yesterday afternoon as a developer who

01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:12,659
actually wrote a debugging tool to

01:04:11,399 --> 01:04:14,130
figure out which kind of libraries is

01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:15,839
available on your page so you can get

01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:18,089
control over that so we beginning to get

01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:20,880
the tools we also need now like five six

01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:22,380
months down the road and I'm pretty sure

01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,089
this is like just the first time we're

01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,829
seeing somebody beginning to think stuff

01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:28,049
outside of the normal trouble circle and

01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:30,109
I know what John is doing thursday it's

01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:33,419
a buff so go down and check it out

01:04:30,109 --> 01:04:35,519
thursday afternoon i think is i'm really

01:04:33,419 --> 01:04:38,130
excited to see what he came up with up

01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,959
crazy ideas and we need to see more of

01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:41,880
these ideas so our front end becomes

01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:44,339
epic and we can build the user

01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,739
experience for our content editors

01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:48,749
alright with that little rant and

01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:50,729
actually going over time so I'm keeping

01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:52,949
my own tradition our now let you set you

01:04:50,729 --> 01:04:57,859
free come and fight the front end with

01:04:52,949 --> 01:04:57,859
