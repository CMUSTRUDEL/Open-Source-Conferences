Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	First the issue will give a short overview about different kind of testing: Unit vs. Integration/Functional testing

After that let's talk about the current status of testing of our javascript (which will be more and more important in the future).

Functional testing (is the PHP based approach what we want?)
How do we integrate javascript unit testing (https://mochajs.org/  | https://jasmine.github.io/) etc.
Visual regression testing
How to scale the Drupal testing infrastructure for that
