Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications— functionality that would normally require a native application—are coming to the web. Service workers provide the technical foundation that all these features will rely on.

Service worker is collection of APIs, that come together to give web applications a set of new and richer capabilities that brings it on par and in cases like offline support trumps over native capabilities.
