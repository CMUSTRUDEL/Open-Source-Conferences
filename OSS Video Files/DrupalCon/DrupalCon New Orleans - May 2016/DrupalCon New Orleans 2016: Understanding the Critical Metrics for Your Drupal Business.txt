Title: DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Understanding the Critical Metrics for Your Drupal Business
Publication date: 2016-05-10
Playlist: DrupalCon New Orleans - May 2016
Description: 
	When you first start a Drupal-centric business you will get a lot of well-intended advice like "know your numbers." The problem: existing, more established competitors are naturally apprehensive about sharing key data points or industry consultants are not in the trenches of actually running an agency - their information is purely anecdotal, oftentimes sounds like preaching or is based on inconclusive surveys.  
In this session, two active Drupal business owners and entrepreneurs will open their curtain and share the critical metrics that have worked for them. More importantly, the execution of these metrics has led to successful growth-based strategies.  We will address a core set of topics predicated around creating greater operational efficiency. The subject matter will include:

* Financials: revenue, margins, EBITDA, utilization, and managing cash flow.
* Sales/Marketing: business development, creating brand awareness, and the best tools and resources to leverage.
* Human Resources: culture, recruiting, and benefits.

The target audience of this session is threefold: (1.) pass the torch and help new Drupal owners be successful (2.) assist established owners to benchmark their data and (3.) provide insight to those who work at Drupal companies to provide a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes.

good afternoon everyone we're we're

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:10,190
really humbled that you are taking time

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:15,360
out of your drupalcon scheduled to

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:17,460
attend this one just continuing on along

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,119
the lines of what Michael was asking a

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,789
quick straw poll how many are sole

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,109
practitioners maybe just have one or one

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:35,700
person consultancy okay how many maybe

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:40,920
one to ten employees 10 to 25 10 to 25

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,870
okay in a 25 or higher 50 more more okay

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,090
great that helps give some context

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,110
there's a few more open seats up here if

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,110
anyone wants to come in

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,860
and just so everyone knows they are

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,020
trying to record the session so even

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,930
though we probably don't need the mic

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,630
they are asking us to use it so if you

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,380
see Michael and I passing the mic or

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,940
coming behind the podium that's why so

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,590
all right well why don't we go ahead and

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,360
get started the title of the session is

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,810
understanding the critical metrics for

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,340
your Drupal business this is the least

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,780
favorite part of the presentation

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,470
because we're forced to talk about

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,490
ourselves but I think one of the unique

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,650
differentiators for Michael and I

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:41,280
presenting the session is that we're

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:45,150
active owner-operators in Drupal centric

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,580
agencies so I know a lot of times when

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,660
you're given advice it's from the author

00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,710
of a book or consultant who may not be

00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:57,210
actively involved in the day-to-day

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:59,460
operations of a Drupal business so we do

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,680
want to give you some framework around

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,730
the lens that we're looking at some of

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,670
the issues through so for media current

00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:11,700
we're a bit of a hybrid the majority of

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:15,570
our team is distributed across 23 states

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,360
we hire all US base w to full-time

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:22,350
employees we have an Operations team

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,940
that's based in Atlanta I am a

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,180
co-founder and partner have been

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,380
involved with a Drupal community since

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:34,560
2007 this is my ninth drupalcon North

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:39,540
America and it's always great to be able

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,000
to share and give back I was also very

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,440
active for a long time in the regional

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,209
Drupal community in the southeast it was

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,700
a primary organizer for drupalcamp

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:54,299
Atlanta if anyone would like to talk

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,900
shop the rest of the week or have us go

00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,730
more in depth about a particular topic

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,430
we'd be more than happy to do that I'm

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,290
really passionate about sales and

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,650
marketing and just open source software

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,700
and culture and those types of topics

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,709
and

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,550
hopefully we'll have enough time in the

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,810
end for Q&A we really want to listen to

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,300
again continuing to what Michael was

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,120
saying you know covering what you want

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,120
to hear in terms of subject matter so we

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,700
have a ton of data points and content

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,680
that we're going to be covering with you

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,800
today and i'm going to let Michael kind

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,769
of segue over introduced himself and

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,330
can't I we do have like four or five

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,250
single seats up front here if you guys

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,440
want to find a seat but I'm Michael

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,970
Silverman I think this presentation kind

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,890
of grew out of the fact that you know

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,720
dave says he happy to talk and share

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,060
about this stuff we've been doing this

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,950
for years so I think the idea here was

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,410
okay some of the stuff that I think we

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,090
figured out our the right metrics for a

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,980
business let's try and share them so

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,730
myself I've got about 30 years in

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,579
business I started duo in 2009 so I've

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,250
been doing that business for just going

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,920
on 17 years now just seemingly like a

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,319
long time and we went all drupal as a

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,790
company in 2009 I've probably been

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,109
coming to drupal cons I think this is

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:20,180
probably my sixth so I found into a 99

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:23,490
so duo we're about 25 people in Chicago

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,320
other unlike Dave we basically had

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,690
everybody coming into the office every

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,479
day duo's been changing because net we

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,550
now have an investment in an affiliate

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,910
with a firm in India so we're sort of

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,760
going to a hybrid model and I can talk

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,070
about that a little bit but just from

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,610
where this is coming from is duos been

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:47,130
around about that size 25 to 35 people

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,010
over the last decade or so you're about

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,020
double that size 65 your distributed

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,810
where we have everyone coming into the

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,520
office but otherwise we're pretty much

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,380
all Drupal focused so these are the

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,240
areas that we wanted to cover so we've

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,460
tried to pick out a number of different

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,500
items that we thought were key areas to

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,000
focus on as business people we're going

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,889
to give be giving them somewhat short

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,950
shrift because we're only spending five

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:17,190
minutes or so on each one but let's go

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,700
and do it so I'm starting out by really

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,470
saying that before you figure out how

00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,240
well you're doing you need to figure

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,040
out if you know where you're going so

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,630
you got to know where you're going and

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,410
then keep your eyes on the dashboard and

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,570
that's what a lot of this is about is is

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,010
knowing what your goal is so what is the

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,080
goal of the business are you looking to

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,450
grow the business you know I wasn't

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,370
really looking to grow duo much larger

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,040
than it became when I started the

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,510
company for various reasons you probably

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,460
were looking for a fair amount of growth

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,200
and have probably grown yep I mean

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,860
you're five years younger than us and

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,510
twice our size so so knowing where you

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,270
want to end up is really the key point

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,070
to start and there's so many good books

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,800
business books that will be recommending

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,260
some of them today good to great by jim

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,330
collins is one of these sort of books

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,210
that everybody reads it's a great book

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:12,780
it has a lot of good things to cover and

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,270
there's so many great books that what i

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,130
got into was this by Verne Harnish

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,190
mastering the Rockefeller habits so what

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,350
Verne Harnish did is he kind of took all

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,960
the best practices from all the latest

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,970
business books of the last 10-15 years

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,190
and put them into kind of an operating

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,290
system for a small business and he

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,780
called it the Rockefeller habits and one

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,250
of the outcomes of this structures that

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,740
you have something called a one-page

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,370
plan it's actually two sides of a page

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,919
but the one-page plan is going to start

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,780
out by you know what are the core values

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,070
and and the purpose of the company and

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,600
you notice here is is hard so it's

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,600
asking you to look out three to five

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,790
maybe seven maybe ten kind of depends on

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,870
where you are in your career of where do

00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,280
you want to be where do you want to be

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,919
when you grow up where are you heading

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,870
to and then you break that down to okay

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,169
where do I need to be three years out

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,879
where do I need to be

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,770
one year out and then where do I need to

00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,960
be every quarter so that's how this

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,909
operating system works there's a couple

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,800
different ways to look at these

00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,449
different operating systems but they

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,370
basically say begin with the end in mind

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,949
and many other books talk about this

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,650
understand where you want to go so both

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:26,229
Dave and I have recently also had sort

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,249
of exits or the ability to sort of exit

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:31,419
from the company or in the process and

00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:34,150
that's also part of what you need to

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:37,120
consider at this point if that is a goal

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,889
for you so rockefeller habits is a great

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,620
book on this there's a guy that worked

00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,629
with Vern on rockefeller habits and

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,020
wrote his own book called traction I

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:49,419
kind of like the traction book as well

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,939
it's a little bit more of a story line

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,789
but it's really the same ideas the same

00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:57,370
kind of one page plan and focus and then

00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,740
another tool that you might want to do

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,629
is join a group like this de jour eyo

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,909
eyo is the entrepreneurs organization

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:07,659
but if you can get together with a group

00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:09,279
of CEOs or you know business people

00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:11,729
within your area usually these groups

00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:15,189
are 8 to 10 people and you sort of share

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:16,930
best practices with each other it helps

00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:21,849
to reinforce a lot of things that are

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:24,580
coming out of these books so we wanted

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:27,370
to purposely start out with culture

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,330
because both Michael and I believe that

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,820
culture is truly the only competitive

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:38,680
sustainable advantage any of us in this

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,899
room have so a very popular topic lately

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,130
in the business world how many are

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:48,940
familiar with simon Sinek so yeah maybe

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,490
twenty five percent so simon Sinek has

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,670
done one of the top five I think now

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,050
most popular TED talks in the world so

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,870
for some of you this is going to be

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,389
reinforcements for most of you it will

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,399
be new so simon Sinek in this TED talk

00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:06,069
talks about a theory called the Golden

00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,699
Circle and he says that most companies

00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:11,800
can tell you what they do so if I asked

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:14,050
many of you in the room what you do you

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,630
could tell me that you do development

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,510
and you do design you do strategy most

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,730
companies can also articulate how they

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,760
it so many of us on a website probably

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,370
have that same you know flywheel diagram

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,460
that shows we do discovery in a defined

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,040
phase and then design and it looks

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,580
pretty similar where companies really

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,160
struggle is telling you why they do what

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,080
they do what's the purpose of the

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,090
company what makes you tick what makes

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,930
your employees want to come and work for

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:49,480
you and cynic has some great

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,960
metaphorical references one that I

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:57,850
really love is many of us have heard the

00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:00,400
story of the Wright brothers and wright

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,150
brothers originally from Ohio I think

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,220
they moved to Kitty Hawk North Carolina

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,790
they were tinkerers they were engineers

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,310
but cynic says they really had this idea

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,350
that they could revolutionize the way

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,960
that we thought about the transportation

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,610
industry but what he says is that a lot

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,910
of people didn't know is that in

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,790
parallel so the Wright brothers was the

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,820
government funding a pretty elite team

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:32,920
of Harvard engineers with unlimited

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:37,060
funding unlimited resources and they had

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,820
all of the again resources budget at

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,740
their disposal to work on a project that

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,980
was very similar to the Wright brothers

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,960
and cynics says we all know kind of how

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,880
the story ends the Wright brothers are

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,650
I've seen it disputed a little bit

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,320
lately but are generally credited for

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:56,710
getting the first you know plane off the

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,870
ground and revolutionising the way that

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,650
we you know think about transportation

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,450
the guys at Harvard the team at Harvard

00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:07,000
was collecting a paycheck they really

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,370
didn't know the purpose of what it is

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,690
that they were working on so why am I

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,810
telling you that I think when you

00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,210
analogize that to your own agency or to

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,340
open source software it's pretty darn

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:22,870
exciting to think when Michael and I

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,450
were first starting 2007-2009 how few

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,860
people had even heard of open source

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:32,259
software only about twenty percent of

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,229
organizations in the world even uses CMS

00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:37,389
so we have the ability we feel like it

00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:41,019
media current to really revolutionize

00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:43,029
the way people think about software and

00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,489
the open web and that's pretty exciting

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:49,600
to think about the impact that our work

00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:52,209
has on organization so the

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,239
recommendation the takeaway is make sure

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,939
you have a mission and a purpose at your

00:11:55,239 --> 00:12:00,309
agency and you're able to articulate

00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:02,139
that to your employees that's one of the

00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:07,539
first things that we do at media current

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:10,779
from day one forward so again this is um

00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:13,600
us looking at things through the prism

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:16,929
of a distributed team model but in terms

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,449
of suggestions on how do you strengthen

00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:23,139
your culture these are some things that

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:26,199
we do I'd highly encourage you to do an

00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,910
end-of-the-year survey for us we've been

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,519
doing it three years and it's great to

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,819
get you know a sampling of seeing where

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:37,989
from the employees eyes we're improving

00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:41,399
or maybe where we're dropping off we do

00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:44,769
for our leadership team quarterly kpi's

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,499
every week at media current during our

00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:50,649
staff meeting we do a knowledge here so

00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:52,839
we'll pick somebody's favorite topic it

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,480
could be about a module that they

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,970
learned it could be about financial

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,910
planning but we're really trying to

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,539
share knowledge across the company every

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,759
week we have a 24 by 7 anonymous

00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:09,399
suggestion box that's so easy to

00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,769
implement it's a simple Google you know

00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,139
template but really surprised how many

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:17,739
organizations don't do it some of our

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:19,929
best ideas have come from employees that

00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:22,720
have given us some good thoughts through

00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:26,470
the suggestion box we do organized team

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,759
building events we schedule a lot of

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:33,729
one-on-one meetings try to find out you

00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:37,539
know what is the morale of the company

00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:40,480
and I know there's tools that you can do

00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,879
that but for us it's not a substitute

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,649
for actually being able to have you know

00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,990
good communication in one-on-one

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:50,350
time with our team we do an annual

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,899
company retreat being virtual again

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,069
being primarily distributed we feel it's

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,519
really important to get everyone

00:13:54,069 --> 00:14:00,850
together in the same room at least once

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,990
a year we have a 2500 dollar continuing

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:08,290
education stipend one of the core parts

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,240
of media currents culture is making sure

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,439
that we are helping our team

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,499
professionally grow and develop so what

00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:19,360
we have heard it from a lot of other

00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:22,300
some other agencies or companies is

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,040
they'll say they encourage professional

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,720
development and growth but they don't

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,850
always you know put their money where

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,459
their mouth is they don't sort of you

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,369
know if they're asked to they asked

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:35,709
manager to attend you know a conference

00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:38,439
or a drupalcamp they might be given you

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:41,589
know push back or resistance so we

00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:45,069
encourage continuing learning that's a

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:48,939
big part of our culture we have a we use

00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:52,600
slack for communication as our primary

00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:54,429
communication tool so we feel that it's

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,199
also important to have be able to have

00:14:54,429 --> 00:15:01,929
private discussion groups maybe you like

00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:05,620
you know have a book club or a certain

00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:08,040
movie interest and we have private slack

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,449
channels that people can join for that

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,660
one of the suggestions that we got

00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:17,139
recently was we don't feel like we have

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,839
enough visibility into you know what's

00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:22,449
going on at media current we'd love to

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,290
hear more announcements and we also

00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:29,860
incorporated doing public praise for

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,160
employees that are doing an above and

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,559
beyond effort so that's something we

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,319
recently implemented and we archive all

00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:42,069
of those company announcements every

00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:45,279
week we also do once a month at a

00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:48,910
minimum for people who have four

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,490
employees or who are in a state with

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,209
multiple employees we will formally set

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,920
up a co-working day for them to just be

00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,270
able to you know get out of their house

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,010
break the monotony

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,940
break the routine so these are some of

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:07,750
the things that we do at media current

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,880
so i mentioned simon Sinek highly

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,810
encouraged it's a seven or eight minute

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:16,740
talk it was pretty real eye-opening for

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,170
me when I first saw it a year or two and

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,540
it's a it's a really really good speech

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,120
the other that has had a lot of

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,620
influence on me personally as well as

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,740
thick michael has read the book as well

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,550
as Daniel pink and drive I'll share one

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:40,000
quick story out of dr that you know

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:45,210
Daniel Pink's basic theory is very

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,160
aligned with simon Sinek he says that

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:52,150
employees generally aren't motivated by

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,720
money and he gives a really neat example

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:59,880
of a restaurant and the restaurant was a

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:03,250
franchise they looked at two line cooks

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,890
two cooks who performed pretty much the

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,600
exact same duties and responsibilities

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:11,470
and had the about the same amount of

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,709
experience they made ones they made to

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:18,430
subtle differences they paid one of the

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:20,560
line cooks thirty percent more twenty to

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:24,130
thirty percent I forget the exact

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,250
increment they paid him more and then

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,660
the other cook they'd made a subtle

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,230
change to the back of the restaurant

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,720
they set up a TV monitor and they set up

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,260
a camera system for different tables

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,900
within the restaurant and he could see

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:44,040
people eating his food that he was

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,670
preparing in the back of the restaurant

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,860
so Daniel pink says guess who has higher

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:53,050
retention in the restaurant that

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,050
implemented that simple strategy and

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,390
it's about purpose right the line cook

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:02,080
was able to see the results of what he

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:05,410
was doing and the person who was making

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,440
more money was more likely to turn over

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:12,049
so great books um that's a couple of

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,940
recommended resources on culture

00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:17,690
yeah culture really is is important it's

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,190
really one of the key differentiators

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,740
especially as we're all sort of chasing

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,360
the same talent pool so it's something

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,610
that you definitely want to focus on I

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,899
think there's different things that you

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,649
need to do if you're a distributed

00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:33,059
organization verse local now if you're

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:35,419
going to keep operating though you need

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,710
to have gross profit so one of the first

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:40,559
metrics that I'm covering is really

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,360
gross profit just briefly to mention

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,090
something about financial statements I'm

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,850
really looking at the profit and loss or

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,620
the income statement you might do these

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,659
on an accrual basis you might do these

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,909
on a cash basis depending on the

00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:56,419
structure of your business you you you

00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:59,220
might essentially just be doing cash

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:01,710
financials because that is what you need

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,380
to pay taxes against but you really

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,750
should be looking at accrual which is

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,279
sort of your operating financials within

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,890
a month and that's where many of these

00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,080
metrics are going to be coming from the

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,110
gross profit target that I think you

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,480
really need to hit if especially with

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,909
all on tour resources is going to be

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,649
about fifty percent and when I talk

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,720
about gross profit I just want to be

00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:27,480
very clear I think that a lot of time

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,190
these metrics get passed around but you

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,440
need to know exactly how people are

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,779
calculating these metrics so when I talk

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,850
about gross profit what you want to do

00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:38,610
is you want to take your sort of net

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,350
operating revenue so if you've got a lot

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,630
of pass through revenue let's just say

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,340
you're doing you know a lot of SEO work

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,350
and Google advertising so you're

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,830
collecting money from your clients and

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,539
giving it to Google obviously that is

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,880
revenue but I'm not counting that

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:56,730
revenue so I have total revenue here on

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,620
the top of 120,000 which might be the

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,390
total revenue take away that pass

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,419
through revenue where you're really just

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,880
not providing a whole lot of added

00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,169
service there and that means that your

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,740
actual revenue for services provided

00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:12,510
would be saying $100,000 a hundred

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,549
percent cost of services would be the

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,130
variable cost of providing those

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,889
services so the people all the costs

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,090
that are involved primarily for

00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:23,159
organizations like us it would be people

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,330
that are used to provide those services

00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:28,190
most of your

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,350
you know accounting systems can can

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,030
manage this for you and you can look at

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,600
a project by project in person by person

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,460
but overall is an aggregate you don't

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,590
really want your variable costs to

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:44,360
exceed fifty percent of your revenue if

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:46,940
you want to be profitable so passed

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,560
through cost is money that you're kind

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,770
of collecting from your customer and

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,350
paying to a vendor and not really adding

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:57,080
value so the example I used was buying

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,520
Google AdWords for people if they're say

00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,840
giving you five thousand a month and

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,080
you're and you're spending that on

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,730
Google okay the consulting services to

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,920
figure out which ad words to buy would

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,870
fall into your consulting revenue but

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,330
the pass through money like you know we

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,520
spent 5 grand on Google and we collected

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,130
five grand for that from the customer

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,420
that would be the pass through class so

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,790
I'm really looking at your operating

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,160
costs fifty percent gross margin for any

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,610
services that you're providing and don't

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,480
fool yourself with those pastor costs

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,340
sometimes it makes you think you're a

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,710
bigger business than you are and you

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,960
might not make the right decisions

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,990
because of it what I'm showing here is

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,190
if you've got fifty percent margin

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,320
operating costs usually shouldn't exceed

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,330
thirty percent so you've got a chance of

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,200
hitting twenty percent growth which is a

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:49,220
nice target to shoot for so segwaying

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,260
over to sales again this could be an

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,120
entire session on itself and we're going

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,360
to try to give you a brain dump on and

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,570
just some key pointers so tools that we

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,570
use I know slept my hand we don't use

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:05,270
sugar we do use Salesforce as our see

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:08,030
our CRM we use something called a gecko

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,490
board as a software I'll show you a

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,570
screenshot later of what a gecko board

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,470
looks like for proposals we still use

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:20,630
Google templates for weave for estimates

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:24,290
in collaboration still find that it's a

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:26,780
viable tool for that so some suggestions

00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:30,050
if there's one thing that you take away

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,640
that's a critical to sales it's around

00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,870
it should be around positioning I'm

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,040
going to go into a little bit more in

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,260
depth in that in a second but

00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,390
positioning is critical if you're out

00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,180
the business summit the other day

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,850
I threw out a few acronyms but one thing

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:47,480
that we try to be cognizant of on every

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:50,090
sales call is qualifying and learning

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,540
about bant bant is an acronym for budget

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,720
Authority need timeline so anytime that

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,400
you talk to a prospect you should be

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,620
establishing what it is that their

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,930
budget is who's the authority or the

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,330
decision maker to be able to approve the

00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,920
sale what's the need what's the pain

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,910
point what kind of problems are they

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,980
trying to solve in is there a time-bound

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:15,590
element to the engagement to the

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,580
initiative you know is this a must-have

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:22,130
project or a nice to have so band

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,170
establishing mlo esm loa is a Wednesday

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,510
where they can give you the answers to

00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:30,290
the band it is not really a prospect

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,520
yeah I we um so budget is always the

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,200
tough one right because you're going to

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,450
ask for budget and then there's this

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,960
back and forth and tug of war nobody

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:41,660
wants to give the first number but I

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,250
would if the prospects afraid if they

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,300
give you a number you're going to come

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:51,380
in a dollar under it right so budget is

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:56,990
probably the hardest one I'm a advocate

00:23:51,380 --> 00:24:00,020
of trying to establish ranges so if you

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,970
come out and say is it a hundred to two

00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,970
hundred thousand is that the range that

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:09,290
you have in mind and try to bracket the

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:11,720
best that you can establish ml Louise is

00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,730
minimum level of engagement one of the

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,200
big mistakes we made early on at media

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,970
current is we were trying to be

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,040
everything that everyone when it came to

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,200
sales we were going to use her group

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,030
meetings we were well-intentioned there

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,810
was a small business who need a Drupal

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:30,320
help and they just weren't a good fit

00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:32,510
for the type of service offerings and

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,720
the type of value that we could provide

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:38,390
so establishing that minimum level of

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:43,540
engagement for us it's a six-month term

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:45,740
and the minimum is 20 hours a month I

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,810
was surprised when I heard that from

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,810
Dave because they're twice our size

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,820
they'll come in and I got so take over

00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:03,150
existing so you need the 20-hour of them

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:08,610
okay I'm support in 20 hours so that's

00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:10,740
pretty small yep what's our man I mean

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:14,040
you look at it in a couple ways right so

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,500
how to project minimum we we're probably

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:40,140
fifty sixty thousand I like to keep it

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:42,919
above that and but exactly so I want to

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:46,919
illustrate the importance of positioning

00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:49,440
through the airline industry of all

00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:53,700
verticals right the airline industry so

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,500
positioning I'm picking on United

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,610
because Michaels from Chicago but I

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,429
could have chosen any probably airline

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:06,419
to plug in here and a lot of people will

00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:08,370
remember post-911 just the amount I'm

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,440
from Atlanta busiest airport in the

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:13,590
world but always when I walk through the

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,410
airport how many airlines were going out

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,679
of business consolidating merging going

00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,770
bankrupt it was a very tumultuous time

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:27,650
in the 2000s for the airline industry

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:31,049
and a lot of um you know consultants

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:33,210
pundants began to research there was one

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:36,330
airline though that sort of stayed

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:39,240
profitable say stayed sustainable and

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,340
was able to persevere through the

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,650
airline industry only one and it was

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,110
Southwest Airlines and they started to

00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,600
look at how it was southwest different

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,510
from Delta or United or all these other

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,970
airlines and they looked at united and

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,549
united would serve every kind of

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:59,640
destination they would serve every kind

00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:01,779
of traveler first class economy they

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,559
would offer every class of service they

00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:08,559
would operate many different aircraft

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,259
and they were unprofitable for most of

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,059
the past decade I think they've recently

00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:15,580
emerged from bankruptcy and are doing

00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:18,609
better but when you compare that you

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,499
can't rast that to Southwest Airlines if

00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:24,009
you've ever flown southwest you know

00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:27,359
they only go to well travel destinations

00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:30,759
they only serve one kind of traveler

00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:34,599
they only offer one class of service

00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:38,169
they only operate one kind of aircraft

00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:41,019
so they became specialist at doing what

00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:44,440
they know and they've been profitable

00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:46,539
again every year when I compared that to

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,929
the business model that we were trying

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:53,200
to establish at media current we've been

00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:56,469
tempted like probably many of you during

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,499
peaks and valleys and times and sales to

00:27:56,469 --> 00:28:02,649
become like United right become more of

00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:06,099
a generalist but we stay down a path to

00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:10,119
singularly focus exclusively in Drupal

00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:12,009
we want to offer like Southwest and some

00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,259
of the other you know companies that are

00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:18,159
known for customer service we want to op

00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:20,979
offer a really high bar when it comes to

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,339
customer service and most successful

00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:26,769
organizations like Southwest aren't

00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:29,109
afraid to be a little different you know

00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:33,570
Southwest commercials around you know

00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:36,509
baggage fees and you know constantly

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,969
trying to think about different ways to

00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:41,889
improve or improvise and we try to take

00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:44,469
that same you know approach and

00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:46,389
mentality at media current and i'm proud

00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:50,289
to say you know we've been profitable

00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:51,700
for nine consecutive years really from

00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:55,539
day one we've had double-digit

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:58,830
percentage growth so i'm sharing with

00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:02,619
you metrics that we actually use in our

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,119
company state of the union so if again

00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:06,159
part of the hope what we were hoping

00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,799
you'd get out of this session and we

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,559
will share this in the end is for you to

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,950
be able to compare things like how are

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,730
we finding new business why were we

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,440
selected

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:25,450
for a project how many new clients did

00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:29,140
we help adopt on to Drupal so again

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:31,600
we'll share this in the end we also look

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,970
at where are we seeing the most industry

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,400
or vertical momentum I think if you are

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,110
at the Aqua summit they valid they

00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,190
validated some of this we're seeing a

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:44,110
really big spike in higher ed our

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,430
conversion rate this surprises some

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:51,730
people there's only twenty six percent

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:54,220
that is somebody who we decided to

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,800
engage in a conversation with and we

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,110
didn't win the deal for whatever reason

00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,090
one of the reasons we lose a lot of

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:05,290
deals because is because of the upper

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:07,720
right we require some kind of discovery

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,060
typically so we have a well-defined set

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,750
of requirements and if the prospect is

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:16,360
unwilling to do that then we'll turn

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:20,790
away the projects we have about a 20

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,440
again twenty six percent conversion rate

00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:25,240
yeah it's a good question um the

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,480
question was do we set ourselves a

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,860
target for conversion rates we'd like it

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,850
to be probably a third thirty-three

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,440
percent but the higher the better i'll

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:42,690
talk about conversions in the marketing

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:46,750
segment though to recommended resources

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:49,540
I'm a big advocate I like the sammler

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,680
methodology the Sandler model I will say

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,380
it's going to be a little bit hit or

00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,840
miss they are franchise some locations

00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,680
are much better than others will

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:03,360
reinforce good to great Jim Collins book

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:07,390
there's a consultant Michael and I

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,550
Michael's gonna has talked a lot more to

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,470
him that I have but they're both sort of

00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,550
out of the same camp called Blair ends

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:20,620
enns Blair is really big around how you

00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:22,360
win deals without ever answering an RFP

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,780
so he has a really great perspective

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,340
that I found very intriguing and Stephen

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,540
Covey seven Habits of Highly Effective

00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,110
People which a lot of people probably

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,210
heard

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:36,030
if there's a lot in this section to

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:38,290
comment on Blair I'm smiling because

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,090
Blair talks a lot about positioning too

00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,230
if you guys could maybe come in in the

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,030
back and we could shut the door I'm

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,370
hearing some noise from that other one

00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:49,570
just sneak up the sides or something

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,710
here come on in so the positioning you

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,630
know one thing I'll say with the

00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,090
positioning is you you definitely need

00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,470
to go narrow it's really hard to do

00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,150
positioning because you're turning away

00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,040
business and especially in the early

00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,080
years of business you kind of want to

00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,700
take everything that you can get but I

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,490
think it is one of the most important

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,110
things to draw a line in the sand on and

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,000
it does take a few years before it'll

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,850
really take hold so if you want to

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,370
switch your positioning every few years

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,799
you're chasing a moving target Blair did

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:20,650
write this book win without pitching and

00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,270
and he's really against answering RFP so

00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,190
I'm like what if you know part of your

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,169
positioning you're going after say the

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,390
higher ed market where there's always

00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:34,179
rfps and he said pick another market

00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:36,940
okay so but you got you got to get the

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,280
sails out there once you got the sails

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,870
out there you got to be able to staff

00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,850
right to support those sales so that's

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,870
the big utilization question and to me

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,669
this is actually the the key to sort of

00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,090
business and business profitability it's

00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:54,400
it it surprises me when when I talking

00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,440
to prospects because you know it seems

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,240
too often times be all about the rates

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,070
you know what your blended rate or what

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,200
are your rates versus other people's

00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,000
rates but it's really sort of efficiency

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,320
with how you get the work done that I

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,570
think we all know as business owners

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,080
that makes you know is really the most

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,280
important thing so utilization I'm

00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,900
really talking about company-wide

00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,120
utilization I've got a picture here of

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,610
Dave Baker he speaks a lot in this area

00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,520
and if you're unfamiliar with him I put

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:23,890
up recourses calm which is his site got

00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,260
his he's really smart he's not very

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,720
personable and not very friendly but

00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,490
he's really smart and he works with you

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,530
know maybe six seven hundred different

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,900
agencies maybe a hundred of them are say

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,030
interactive agencies where we would fall

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,040
and then he compares metrics against

00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,350
best practices so this is where the

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,000
utilization is coming from and you know

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,010
we're looking for utilization on

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,740
companywide level at seventy percent or

00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:51,250
higher okay now let me talk to you about

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,410
company-wide level you you can look at

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,050
say revenue per employee this is another

00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,490
way to do it it's just another way to

00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,310
give you an idea of what I'm talking

00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,230
about so if you've got say a 10-person

00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,780
company and say you know seven of those

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:08,429
people are billable okay so that ten

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:11,560
person company if it does 1.6 million

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:13,450
you divide the 1.6 million by the 10

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,179
people not just the billable people and

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:19,330
get about 160,000 ahead the numbers that

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:21,490
I here in this area are maybe 160 to 180

00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,710
are what you really need to look for for

00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,600
every person in your company so if it's

00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,909
much lower than that you've got too many

00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:32,919
people in your company and you private

00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:35,649
okay with utilization you know a highly

00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:39,669
productive worker can maybe can generate

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:41,980
16 1700 billable hours in a year that's

00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:44,409
that's about what both of us are getting

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,060
out of highly productive workers have

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:48,610
were able to keep them busy some

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:51,010
organizations I understand actually get

00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,179
about 2,000 hours of year billable and

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:55,810
maybe they're at the eighty-five percent

00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:58,720
level this I got this from one of one of

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,580
greece's articles I don't see frankly

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,800
how they're able to do that unless

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:08,050
people are just constantly working more

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,190
than you know 40 45 hours a week so what

00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,320
you want to do is you want to take the

00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,240
total number of billable hours that you

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,600
generate billable hours not internal

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,790
projects okay not cost overages that you

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,090
didn't charge for okay total number of

00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:24,280
billable hours for the time period so

00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:27,970
let's say there's 1700 you know for a

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,160
staff of let's say a staff of 15 people

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:32,410
12 of which are billable so I take the

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,500
12 billable people times the 1700 hours

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,480
gets a 20,000 hours then you take the

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,550
total number of employees and you're

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,930
going to multiply that by around 2000

00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:45,160
hours per employee that's sort of the

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:48,910
theoretical maximum we use 1920 which is

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,310
based on 40 hours a week and 48 weeks so

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,260
the denominator doesn't change I don't

00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,109
change this number if somebody goes on

00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,630
vacation

00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,400
alright so I'm taking the numerator

00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,039
which is the billable hours divided by

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,140
the denominator I'm including every

00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,119
person in the company and that's where

00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,130
you want to be above seventy percent and

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,380
i'll tell you i spent about five years

00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,579
just trying to figure out utilization

00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,519
because everyone talks about it

00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:15,109
differently you can calculate it

00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,239
differently just stick with how to go

00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:19,640
with it but it's it's really important

00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,749
to look at this number to see how your

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,749
staffing if you want to be profitable

00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:31,609
yes so for this example we're looking at

00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:39,410
maybe a you know a million six company

00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:41,329
and something like that so yes you

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,609
wanted least seventy percent utilization

00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:46,069
when you're counting every person in the

00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:49,039
organization you take every person

00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:55,549
organization basically found 40 hours a

00:36:49,039 --> 00:37:04,119
week times a 48 weeks for the people

00:36:55,549 --> 00:37:04,119
that you can do this for a month

00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:14,619
so next topic is recruiting and we

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,809
looking at the time we want to make sure

00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:18,369
we cover all the subject matter so some

00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:19,599
of this we make loss over but definitely

00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,450
want to leave time in the end for

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,420
questions so recruiting tip one of the

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,480
these are just again suggestions things

00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,839
that we leverage it at media current one

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,660
of the bigger mistakes that we've seen

00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:36,190
newer agencies make especially is

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,450
they're looking for that silver bullet

00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,250
they almost have that slot-machine

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:42,039
mentality when it comes to recruiting

00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:45,460
what do I mean by that if I post that

00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:48,099
one job on a Drupal job board or

00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,230
LinkedIn I sit back with a catcher's

00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,089
mitt on and try to wait for resumes to

00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,210
come in you know stop doing that

00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:57,250
recruiting is I don't have a secret

00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,260
honey hole Michael doesn't where we can

00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,109
go and tell you to find you know great

00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,700
talent that nobody else knows about

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:05,710
recruiting is really just a concerted

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,900
effort if there's one thing I would say

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,329
to focus on it's incorporating and

00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,289
networking into your week to try to find

00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:15,490
great people and for us employer

00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:18,339
referrals have been the number one

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:23,230
source for hiring the last four or five

00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:25,200
years I get asked this a lot like so

00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:29,380
what if we don't have the immediate

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,329
sales to support a great person would

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,859
you recommend hiring them even though

00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:34,839
you don't have the production to

00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:36,700
necessarily keep them at the capacity

00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:40,240
that you need my recommendation will be

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,279
yes don't bypass great people because

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,529
you don't have the immediate need you

00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:47,470
should try to align you know finding

00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:49,720
that person and rectifying and leveling

00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:53,289
off later if you have an opportunity to

00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,390
find somebody hire them don't skip

00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:58,960
reference checking really surprised how

00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:01,390
people take for granted that every

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,190
reference is going to be good anyway so

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,500
I don't need to check references we have

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,049
a very formal reference checking process

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,200
we require at least one of the

00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:15,029
references to be a former manager or

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,319
direct supervisor of the person of

00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:19,630
course when we talk about

00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:22,359
rooting you have to do a lot less

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:25,319
recruiting if you're able to retain

00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:29,589
great people and you have low turnover

00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:31,319
the key for really retention for us is

00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:33,549
going back to what I said about

00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:36,339
professional growth and development it's

00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:39,849
taking a vested interest in your team's

00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:41,709
success and then we also the first 90

00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:44,229
days I think first impressions are

00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:46,029
critical we have a three day onboarding

00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:49,779
where everyone in the company comes to

00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:52,930
Atlanta we then do a formal checkpoint

00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:55,539
at 45 days and we do another check-in at

00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,920
90 days again we wanting to make sure

00:39:55,539 --> 00:40:02,019
they're getting assimilated they're

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,420
getting effectively on board yeah so

00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:07,239
that's coming up next yep so tools

00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,579
quickly that we use I'm not we don't get

00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,999
any kickbacks Michael and I from these

00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:15,339
tools this is just what we use we like

00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:18,579
jazz okay I think the name used to be

00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:22,180
resume tur we use disk for personality

00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:24,729
testing operations people like sales i'm

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:29,099
in the process now of evaluating a tool

00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:32,319
for employer reviews called perform yard

00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:35,920
this is a sample the purse that

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,779
gentleman was asking what is a example

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,109
of questions that we ask for the check

00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:43,529
in so i know this is small print again

00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:46,479
we're going to send you the deck but

00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:48,849
this is just you know an example of the

00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:51,069
template that we use to do the 45-day

00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:53,529
check-in you know are you familiar with

00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:58,269
the company's business model do you know

00:40:53,529 --> 00:41:00,219
how to file pto silly it sounds do you

00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:01,719
know who you report to you know these

00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:05,039
are just questions that we want to

00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:08,410
validate during you know the check-in

00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,140
recommended resources it's about 10 year

00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:14,709
old book now but top grading is one that

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:17,259
I really like and then this is a an

00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:19,599
example chart of what a disc profile

00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:22,089
looks like and we could talk about that

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,310
later just for everyone or just for sale

00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:26,820
just for

00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:30,090
yeah just for sale here early and and

00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,440
when he mentioned you know employ using

00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:35,040
your employees for recruiting it's

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,890
really the best source we both pay a

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,790
bounty on that I think thousand dollars

00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:43,020
yep we do do yeah ours is a thousand so

00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,820
we're both paying a thousand-dollar

00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,950
referral bonus I actually went to two

00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,020
thousand dollars for referral bonuses

00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:52,310
for a bit and then I realized that a

00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:55,500
thousand was enough to make my point I

00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,330
think with a number like that it's not

00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,010
like people you know want the money so

00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,990
bad but it kind of keeps the top of mine

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,210
and they really think about people for

00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:05,070
recruiting I also find the camps are

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,630
gonna good for recruiting because you

00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,030
know the people that maybe come to the

00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,460
camps are or may be different than the

00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,500
people that will come to the cons all

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,240
right labor efficiency is my next metric

00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,370
so this is kind of a little bit more of

00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,830
an advanced metric but we use it and I

00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:21,540
kind of like it it sort of looks at

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,610
utilization but remember when I talked

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,650
about utilization I talked about it on a

00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,720
company level and we're really looking

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,400
at say you know one thing that that will

00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,790
tell us is if we have too much overhead

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:38,850
relative to our our number so this idea

00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:41,100
of le our labor efficiency ratio it

00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,110
comes from a guy named Craig Greg

00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,870
Crabtree who wrote this book simple

00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:47,490
numbers straight talk and you're

00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,890
basically taking the revenue on an

00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:51,900
individual level and dividing it by

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,060
their wages so you don't have to figure

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,400
in taxes or benefits you're you're

00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:00,090
looking at individual productivity here

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:04,380
by looking at somebody's cost on the

00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:06,690
time revel in their cost on the bottom

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,430
okay and then the big thing here is that

00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:11,640
you're really looking at this over time

00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,590
so we would be looking at this day on a

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,720
monthly basis and just to give you an

00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:17,130
idea of how this number works you know

00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,080
let's just say you've got a developer

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:22,080
that you're paying $80,000 to and

00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,720
they're generating 267,000 this is of

00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,760
course annualized just so it may seem a

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,970
little more familiar you just take the

00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,560
267 over the 80 and you're at 3.34 so

00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,840
that's what these lvr numbers are going

00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,420
to look like it'll be you know two three

00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,050
four one something like that so maybe an

00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,070
architect

00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:42,180
that costs more is is generating a

00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,920
little bit more money but they're

00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,560
costing more so you can see how their

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,750
lar is going to be lower so you might

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,670
you know it may be there rid of your

00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:53,520
developers in a sense that have a higher

00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:56,390
lar unless you're able to gets a higher

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,980
price points for higher-priced employees

00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,110
somebody like myself who might bill very

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,920
little is going to have a very low lar

00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,600
it's just the case a project manager our

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,120
project managers bill at around fifty

00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,980
percent or that's sort of their goal so

00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,950
there lar is going to be closer to one

00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,930
and a half then say two and a half so

00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,990
it's a it's an interesting way to look

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:20,970
at an individual person and then what we

00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,560
do is we look at that metric over time

00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:26,400
so I'm saying that you want your le are

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,070
to be above 2.5 now again I'm not

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,260
including people that are only a portion

00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,840
billable I'm really looking at the

00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,220
billable people here but it's a it is

00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,860
important that you look at this over

00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,930
time because how billable someone can do

00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,930
does depend on the work that's in-house

00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:44,820
so certainly in any single period there

00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,710
might be somebody who's le are drops

00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,510
because they don't have billable work to

00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,220
do say that month they're spending a

00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,710
couple weeks on the bench but when you

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,290
look at it over time okay so you look at

00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,330
the le our overtime per employee you can

00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,040
see you know who is on the bench more

00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,660
and who isn't because what I find is

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,300
that kind of what i call the best

00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,830
employees they tend to sort of attract

00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,260
the work and it comes to them and they

00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,120
can stay highly billable and then I

00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,630
think you also have to take into account

00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:15,300
cost which is what this quotient comes

00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,430
in and this this comes in handy so we

00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,380
can really see who's driving sort of the

00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,270
profitability through for the business

00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,540
it helps me when I'm looking at raises

00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:27,480
for individuals and makes me understand

00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:34,580
you know how to use my most expensive

00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:37,950
people so next topic is on marketing so

00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:41,460
just a few again tools and suggestions

00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:44,850
we use a media current part out as much

00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,620
for marketing automation so one of the

00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,940
big reasons we chose part out in all

00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,100
honesty was the geographic proximity

00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,390
they were headquartered in Atlanta but

00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,119
we

00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:55,400
really we really like par not probably

00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:00,380
the single most important marketing

00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:03,619
metric for us is conversions so while we

00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:06,230
generate a lot of content we want to

00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:10,039
make sure that content that's generating

00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:12,890
the leads is actually converting to cuss

00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:15,500
paying customers so I would say make

00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:17,960
sure you you become less focused on how

00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,690
much traffic your site's getting or how

00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,430
much how many Twitter followers you have

00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,380
what's really important is how many of

00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,049
those people are you converting to again

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,940
actual customers so I mentioned

00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:30,920
Geckoboard earlier if you walked into

00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,130
media currents office this would be on

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,260
display this is our actual monitor from

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:41,539
I guess a few weeks ago but we're

00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:46,430
tracking real-time results of what kind

00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:49,460
of impact our content is having this is

00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:53,289
just again from our company overview I

00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:57,230
see agencies make a lot of mistakes

00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:59,000
around they will tell their employees

00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:01,750
their team that everybody should do

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,250
sales we don't believe that

00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:08,390
philosophically we feel that sales is a

00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:11,960
very separate skillset from those who do

00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:14,569
engineering or marketing or different

00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,390
areas of the company what we do believe

00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:21,170
though is that everyone at media current

00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:24,319
is a marketer everyone can be engaged in

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:27,470
creating content that helps with leads

00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:30,190
and we track everything they're related

00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:33,319
to that so last year we blogged

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:36,500
literally every two or three days 126

00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:39,200
blog post we published six ebooks we did

00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:43,400
six things like video testimonials with

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:45,980
customers we drafted for case studies we

00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,410
look at who are the most popular so some

00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,910
of you who are in the development side

00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,579
probably know Damien mechana he's

00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:55,240
probably one of the top 20 contributors

00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:59,269
to Drupal in the world he was our top

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,839
contributor last year at media current

00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:03,550
we look at what kind of blog posts

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,250
generate the most

00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:09,850
traffic so for us we have a employee

00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:12,970
puts out a top 50 module list a ton of

00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:15,580
exposure ton of visibility we look at

00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:18,340
who's downloaded the most content so

00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:21,460
those ebooks I mentioned you know which

00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:24,640
ones are getting the most exposure so

00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:27,540
some recommendations you know content

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,920
marketing audit Institute contagious

00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:34,420
shameless plug michael has written a

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:37,360
book on community forums capture

00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:39,460
capturing communities so you can check

00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,280
out his book online as well I'm working

00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:45,570
so we're both doing content marketing I

00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:48,250
think that's important and we're both

00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:50,980
using the data and the results from the

00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,260
content marketing to sort of bet do

00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,610
better marketing okay so i think content

00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,400
marketing is definitely a good way to go

00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,930
i just wanted to go back here top on the

00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,390
top right there for you guys organic

00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,740
search is sixty percent of where their

00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,240
traffic is coming from and that's

00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,920
because of the content marketing that

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,870
they're doing and then they're moving in

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,760
through the funnel to conversion so if

00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,800
you're into this stuff cmi content

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,660
marketing institute is a great place to

00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,510
learn more they also put on an event

00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,460
called content marketing world hubspot

00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:22,030
is writing like five times a day about

00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,980
this stuff recurring revenue though if

00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,930
you're is a marketing engine gets going

00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,580
you know we talked about the importance

00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,500
of getting new sales keeping the sales

00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,380
that you have keeping the clients that

00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,600
you have for many years is really key

00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,700
and Jim Collins talks about this in good

00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,650
to grade he talks about the flywheel and

00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,840
as the flywheel gets moving and for many

00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,790
of us I think the flywheel is recurring

00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,580
revenue that comes from subscription

00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:47,920
services in the early days of duo I used

00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,450
to put hosting into this category and we

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,340
used to do hosting for people but it's

00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:53,800
really become relatively you know

00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,410
commoditized but having service

00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,300
agreements that with clients we try once

00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,010
the client finishes a project with us we

00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,390
do try to get them involved with a

00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,920
service agreement where there's a set

00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,140
number of hours per month and it really

00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,490
much just recurs and renews every

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:10,840
quarter every year and that is the goal

00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,850
there i think is about to get about

00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,890
forty percent of your revenue from

00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:16,270
recurring revenue because that'll just

00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:18,400
about cover your nut

00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,290
so you really want to focus on that

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,000
another goal you could have in mind to

00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,190
say a million dollars of recurring

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,320
revenue ok so that would be your about a

00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,000
two million dollar business if you know

00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,180
forty percent a million eight whatever

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,640
so once you hit that goal it it really

00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,950
makes it really changes the way i think

00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,050
you feel as far as security moving

00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:41,950
forward as far as the business

00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:44,650
continuity emphasize enough focusing on

00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:47,950
so client services um if you were at the

00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:50,260
Aqua a-- event something that they

00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:52,960
reinforced i found interesting and i

00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,670
wish i had i could articulate this but

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,440
for whatever reason it seems like after

00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:59,950
about five years at being at an agency

00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,380
maybe the 30-40 employee mark net new

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:05,500
logo growth and sales becomes much

00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,750
harder you begin to pivot to more of a

00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,390
land and expand model so you're trying

00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,820
to generate more business from your

00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:16,330
existing accounts because it becomes

00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:18,190
harder to attract new newer customers so

00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:20,560
some of the things that we do on the

00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:22,870
client services front client health

00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,750
survey we have a post-mortem template

00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:28,450
will have a welcome kit so during the

00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,910
kickoff meeting will make sure that

00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:33,730
there's a familiarity with the project

00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:35,350
team who's assigned to the client so

00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:38,230
we're trying to build you know that

00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:39,760
strong partnership relationship from day

00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:41,620
one with the welcome kit and i'm going

00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,040
to show you a screenshot of what that

00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:46,270
looks like for us suggestions

00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:49,120
established a formal cadence of touch

00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:51,580
point touch points creating credibility

00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,950
and Trust by you know adding value this

00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:56,650
is something that aquia talked a lot

00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:59,860
about as well everyone's now is trying

00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:04,510
to become more full service right you

00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:06,460
can no longer land work in many cases if

00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:08,950
you're purely a hardcore Drupal

00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,950
development shop you know customers are

00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:15,490
demanding more the buyers becoming more

00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,960
sophisticated and one thing at media

00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:18,610
current we try to emphasize is just we

00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,450
should understand our customers problems

00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:23,980
better than them that's just a

00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,210
philosophy you could think about and one

00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,410
thing we did I mentioned this at the

00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,990
Business Summit a couple of years ago

00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,710
that added a lot of value is higher a

00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:31,630
third party

00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:34,690
market research firm to gather

00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:36,310
unfiltered feedback so a lot of times if

00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:39,400
you ask the customer in the middle of a

00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:40,420
project hey how's it going they're not

00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,089
going to give you that unfiltered

00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:47,710
feedback like they would if it was done

00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:50,260
by a third party this is the welcome kit

00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:53,230
I mentioned just with our sort of table

00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:57,180
of contents again we'll we'll share our

00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:57,180
information where you can get the slides

00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:05,380
recommended resources I think my quant

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:08,950
are both fan of a Zappos around customer

00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:10,510
service if you've read any books or know

00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:13,359
anything about their culture they have a

00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:14,890
very they have a lot of culture camps

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,410
that they do a lot of customer service

00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:23,410
workshops so that would be one to look

00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:25,420
at so finishing up with ebit ah you got

00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:27,790
to have earnings and what are the

00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:30,730
earnings and what are you shooting for

00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:33,339
so the earnings ebit ah is earnings

00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:35,320
before interest taxes depreciation and

00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:37,150
amortization so it's a standard

00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,619
accounting form it's going to be the

00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:42,420
bottom line the net income on your

00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:45,130
income statement you can add back the

00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,320
depreciation or amateur ization you do

00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:50,619
need to kind of normalize owner salary

00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:53,740
here so it's hard to say what's normal

00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:55,330
for Omer over salary what would you get

00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,680
paid if you were working elsewhere is

00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:59,470
one way you could answer the question

00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,180
when I asked what owners should be paid

00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,589
the numbers always seemed higher than I

00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,260
was ever able to take out of the company

00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:07,390
myself but you really want to look at

00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:09,099
profits I used to you know I used to

00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,330
think like okay we just you know want to

00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:14,200
make sure we're profitable and certainly

00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:16,270
pay me a salary the goal really is you

00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,150
could hit twenty percent I know Dave

00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:22,210
hits twenty percent profitability on an

00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:24,430
ebit basis I don't want to say regularly

00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:26,589
but he he has duo hasn't been quite that

00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:28,300
profitable for us ten percent Slyke the

00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:29,950
minimum that were comfortable with we're

00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,480
probably more in the ten to fifteen

00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,190
percent range it may be a little bit

00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:36,070
different because of the distributed

00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:37,050
model versus the local model and then

00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:39,120
the value

00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:41,580
of your company is probably going to be

00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,290
about five to eight times that ebit uh

00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:48,000
number and they're going to look at it

00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:50,130
over a few years so again if you're if

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,230
you're you know let's just say making

00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:54,540
fifty thousand dollars a year that's

00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:57,900
going to value the business at probably

00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:58,830
about 300 350 thousand dollars okay so

00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,960
they're going to look at your

00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:03,150
profitability in any person that's

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,410
interested in investing or acquiring is

00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,360
going to be looking at your

00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:09,270
profitability over at least a three year

00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:11,130
period okay so understand you can't have

00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,360
like good news numbers one year lousy

00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,400
numbers the next year good numbers the

00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,290
next year you got to put together a few

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,890
good years they'll probably wait the

00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:21,270
most recent year heavier but I'm saying

00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,830
this because again you got to think

00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,960
about where it is you're trying to do if

00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,280
that's not part of your plan and it may

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:31,290
not be something that you need to focus

00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:32,700
on so just and if we Michael and I both

00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:35,460
mentioned in the beginning we have both

00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,920
kind of klein dough climbed over a

00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,830
certain wall we've been through some

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,050
exit strategies and here are a lot of

00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:45,060
common questions like what size do we

00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:47,880
need to be to be attractive to a buyer

00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:50,910
should I use a broker if I'm interested

00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:55,170
in selling my company my agency what

00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:56,820
kind of terms should I expect we want to

00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:59,160
cover those questions we're running up

00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,870
against it on time hopefully no one may

00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,650
be will kick us out if you want us to

00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:07,560
expound on some of these questions but

00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:09,960
the really one of the key thoughts we

00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,150
wanted to leave you with was just focus

00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:17,400
on what you can directly influence or

00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:19,380
control right don't let selling your

00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,730
company be a distraction you can't

00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,500
control who's going to win the next

00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,240
presidential election you can't control

00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,310
if the economy is going to tank there

00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,130
are things you can control like your

00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:32,790
attitude your activity within the

00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:34,560
company and have an influence over

00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,420
things like your culture so that's what

00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:40,550
you should really focus on and usually

00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,550
an exit is the byproduct of those things

00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,660
email is a really good way to reach us

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,550

open to share is the next presenter here

00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,730
any questions we could try to fit in a

00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:47,080
bit of before do trust taxes and
