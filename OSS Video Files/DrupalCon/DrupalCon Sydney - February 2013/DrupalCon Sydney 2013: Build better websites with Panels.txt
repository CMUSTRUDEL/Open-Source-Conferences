Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Build better websites with Panels
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Drupal is somewhat limited in how it handles the layout of content on the page. It assumes every page on any given site will use exactly the same layout, and that the only really important content on that page will sit right smack in the middle.

Fortunately, we can use the Panels module to build smarter displays of content than Drupal can handle on its own.

Panels offers a variety of layouts for us to choose from, and also allows us to provide our own. After a layout is selected, panels allows us to position our content into that layout however our hearts desire.

In this session you'll learn the basics of the Page Manager user interface, and how to implement some of the the most common uses for panels: including:

a custom home page layout
unique landing pages
strategic content layouts
better category pages
useful user profiles
I'll also show you some great examples of Panels solving real-world problems in interesting ways, and explain how the same result can be achieved on your own site.

Time permitting, I'll also show you how easy it is to provide your own panels layouts, write your own custom content panes for panels, and even create your own access rules.

Come see how much better your live can be with panels, and find out why I put panels on every site I build!

um all right so uh you just heard a

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,429
little bit about me my name is Jen

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,010
Lampton would be a little longer story I

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,500
started building websites back in 2006

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,780
and with Drupal um started building

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,670
websites in 1997 it's a lot longer than

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,160
that but when i first started building

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,230
sites with drupal i was a site builder I

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,490
just wanted to click all the blocks

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,789
together and have it turn into a

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,800
beautiful tool for my clients to use and

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,539
so I like to approach how I build

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,820
websites today with that same kind of

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,010
perspective of are the tools i'm using

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,180
as a developer friendly enough for site

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,149
builder so i'm going to talk a little

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,829
bit about why that leads me to love pin

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,710
else as much as I do I started helping

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,300
the local Drupal community in berkeley

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,770
in the san francisco bay area in about

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,170
two thousand seven which was here we had

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,699
our first Bay Area drupalcamp I'm now

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,930
the lead organizer for the Bay Area

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,460
triple camp along with a lot of other

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,109
really great community members who

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,660
helped put on this camp every year for

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,820
free which is pretty cool and in 2010 I

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,489
was also one of the organizers for

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,780
drupalcon San Francisco that was held in

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,369
Barry as well um I've been writing

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,799
modules for Drupal since about two

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,600
thousand eight I stumbled across some

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,830
need one of my client had where a module

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,540
didn't exist and I was like I'm not

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,799
really sure if I can do this but I guess

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,479
I've got to try it because they need

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,240
anyway and it turns out it was really

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,720
easy and I kind of had really high

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,009
expectations for what modules of l'a /

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,329
furred Drupal was and when I started

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,710
mucking around in the code and realized

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,509
that all you had to do is write a couple

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,680
of functions in the right way and you

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,049
can make sure will do exactly what you

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,659
wanted to I kind of fell in love so in

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,700
2010 right after we held drupalcon San

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,500
Francisco we had our first training day

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,810
in association with the drupalcon and we

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,520
trained over 500 people and all of a

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,869
sudden became clear the Drupal needed

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,219
training there was this huge market for

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,159
all these people who wanted to learn

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,570
drupal and needed help and so I was

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,590
working for chapter 3 at the time and

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,590
they decided to start a training

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,509
division and I started writing a bunch

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,770
of training materials on Drupal so how

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,160
do you teach people how to use Drupal

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,540
and we were mostly trying to train site

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,410
builders we wanted to train the people

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,630
who are going to be used

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,010
drupal to build websites as opposed to a

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,050
bunch of developers and theme developers

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,640
we focused on later but initially i

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,470
started writing a bunch of training also

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,720
on panels because I wanted more people

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,490
to know how to use panels in 2011 I had

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,500
spent a year training people on how to

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,940
use Drupal and I felt that most of the

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
time I was pointing a Drupal saying we

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,000
know that this doesn't make any sense

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,890
and at some point we're going to fix it

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,690
and I felt like I could have been one of

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,220
those people who was fixing it so I got

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,930
myself involved with a usability team

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,580
and we did a bunch of usability tests

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,210
both at the University of Minnesota and

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,610
then later in early 2012 at the Google

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,560
usability labs to try and figure out

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,570
what it was about using Drupal it was

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,610
quite so hard and making some changes

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,830
and how we named things how we organize

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,750
things that just made site builders have

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:05,370
a much easier time working with Drupal

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,740
and shortly after that we realized that

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,150
not only is using Drupal from a site

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,010
builder perspective really hard but

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,590
trying to teach people how to theme for

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,900
Drupal particularly Drupal 7 was way too

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,020
hard and so I started focusing not only

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,090
on what we call usability but also

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,620
something i call learnability which is

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,920
trying to make Drupal easier for people

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,450
to learn and a big part of that to me

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,800
was replacing our theme layer with

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,780
something that made a lot more sense to

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:37,350
people so now I'm involved with trying

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:39,090
to get twig in for oblate so I'm

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,400
obviously very heavily invested in this

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,810
Drupal business I really love it I think

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,550
that what I do every day is a lot of fun

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,770
I get to wake up and play with toys

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,959
basically all day long and then deliver

00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,160
products to clients who need them and I

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,320
feel like that's a really good place for

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,150
me to be every single website i build I

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,770
put panels on that doesn't mean you need

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,860
panels on every single website that's

00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,630
out there but I find a use for it and a

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,459
benefit for doing that so panelist is

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,459
also my favorite module in all of Drupal

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,850
so now that you know a little bit about

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,070
me I want to try and take a poll and try

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,510
and figure who's in the room just so

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,100
I've got a couple of examples at the end

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,200
I need to know how technical I should

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,209
get with them so of the people in room

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,470
can we get a show of hands how many of

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,780
you have been building Drupal websites

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,750
for less than a year so I'm assuming

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,200
most of you are all working in Drupal 7

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,700
okay so

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,760
how many people have you been I've been

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,560
welding websites for more than a year

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,910
okay how many of you also built websites

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,070
in Drupal 6 okay and so what I'm going

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,080
to try and do is is it's a little bit

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,690
easier to relate some of what panels is

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,880
trying to get you to think about how we

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,860
used to do things in the past things did

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,080
not change very much front an attempt

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,540
layout perspective between Drupal 6 and

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,550
Drupal 7 I actually think they got worse

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,350
so panels is pretty much the same

00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,060
between Drupal 6 in Drupal 7 solves all

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,910
the same problems in a lot of the same

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,120
ways so well we'll do some comparisons

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:07,000
between the two of those two so

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,830
originally this is like flashback to how

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,860
Drupal got into the problem that it's in

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,170
now with layouts Drupal assumed that

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,270
every website made in Drupal would use

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,070
exactly the same layout and that would

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,250
be sidebar on left side one right

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,660
content the middle and back in 2001 this

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,070
was really great because everybody had

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,450
websites have lots of content that were

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,450
going to use this kind of format and it

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:32,110
was trendy and whatever and that's fine

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:34,420
but there's a couple of problems with

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,060
this for starters this assumes that the

00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,500
content for any given page is always

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,750
going to be in the middle of the page

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,580
and the way the templating system works

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,260
is it actually treat to the content as

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,370
like a single variable it just prints it

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,780
out it also assumes that the stuff stuff

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,330
that goes around at this would ripple

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,070
calls blocks is always not really gonna

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,390
have anything to do with your content so

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,920
that when Drupal renders the page it

00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,990
puts out the content and at six a bunch

00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,970
of stuff around the outside and as that

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,040
stuff is being prepared it doesn't have

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,590
any idea what's going on in the middle

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,210
of page so the stuff has no clue what's

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,490
next to it which makes it really hard

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,780
for you to make your content relevant to

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,300
each other on different parts of the

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:17,560
same page so that was a happy for a

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,180
little while we're like okay that's fine

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,350
we can print make websites like that and

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,700
there are a lot of web sites on the web

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,160
today that still work like this and

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,530
they're perfectly fine but there are

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,620
some people who want it to do something

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,230
different a lot of people need different

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,520
layouts for different pages homepage is

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,780
something really common if we're just

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,040
like I don't want my homepage to have

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,600
exactly the same layout as every other

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,130
page on my site it's different it's

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,440
special it needs more attention

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:45,350
so we're like okay well we can give you

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,810
some tools for your blocks to control

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,000
where they appear you can decide okay

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,620
this page should this block should or

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,910
should not appear on homepage you can

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,640
say this block should or should not

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,870
appear for a specific user role or hey

00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,350
here's a box so you can throw in some

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:03,620
PHP code that's a good solution right

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:06,200
and we decided to make the one layout

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,450
that Drupal comes with flexible so we're

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,890
like okay if you tell all the blocks on

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,050
the right sidebar not to appear that

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,550
page can just adjust and say hey there's

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,350
no sidebar I'm wider guess what I'm a

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,610
two column layout haha but it's not it's

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,540
really a three-column layout just with

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,550
nothing in that column um well that's

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,050
fine until you have like 18 blocks in

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,580
your right sidebar and you add a new

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,590
page it doesn't want to right sidebar

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,060
and you're like oh I've got added 18

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,650
block configurations that I don't show

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,180
on this page so in this panel in this

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,290
picture and after about the fifth time

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,740
you're like screw this I need a better

00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,480
solution all right so let's look at our

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,100
template files we've got code we can

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,960
change the code let's just go into the

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,760
template file and create a special one

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,950
just for some specific page for example

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,950
here's the home page and say let's just

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,320
not print the sidebar right no sidebar

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,330
on this page no problem well actually

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,740
that's problematic too because even if

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,600
you're not printing the content of the

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,070
page drupal still goes into the database

00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,630
retrieves all the content wraps and its

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,460
theme functions sticks it together and

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,810
then just doesn't do anything with it so

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,980
you've wasted all of this time we're

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,840
drupal's gathering information in

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,500
getting ready for display and then just

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,020
not playing at the end so okay that's

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,640
not good enough either um we also rented

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,450
some crazy problems with the user

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:22,010
interface on the block's page where what

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:23,420
if you want some block to appear on the

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,310
Left sidebar on the home page on the

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,960
right side bar and a subpage you can't

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,670
it's either in one region or it's not

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,310
you can't have it in two regions with

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,780
conditions but guess what we're running

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,310
out of time to solve this problem and

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,600
we've got a ship Drupal 7 so that was

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,280
Drupal 6 land right right now with me in

00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,050
pupils heaven so what are we going to do

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,480
to let people have more flexibility and

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:49,460
how we deal with this in core we can add

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:52,010
a crazier starting layout so we changed

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,610
our default from garland which is our

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,339
previous

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,829
to bar pick and bartok has lots and lots

00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,700
and lots of regions and this is great

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,709
because it gives you a lot of

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,060
flexibility you can say Oh on one page

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,440
we're going to use this triptych region

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,180
and on another page we can use the like

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,430
for column footer regent and then it's

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,649
kind of different you can like puts like

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,750
a different layout only it's still one

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,180
layout you're just putting stuff places

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,190
and not and it came with some other

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,810
problems now where we have this giant

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,040
drop-down of like what region do you

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,269
want this content to go when people look

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,740
at that in there like what I don't know

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,100
where these are what the hell is it trip

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,329
right there's just stuff in here that it

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,010
cluttered up or user interface and

00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:30,620
didn't actually solve the problems we

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,810
wanted to solve one of the problems here

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,880
is that our content is still just one

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,279
giant content variable in the middle of

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,630
your page so that didn't get solved

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,399
either so what is the solution well as

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,660
it turns out there are five ways to

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,490
solve every problem in Drupal you

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,500
probably all discovered that already a

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,769
solution that I love more than any other

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,720
is panels um so panels lets you control

00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,950
layouts that's the big thing there's a

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,019
lot of other stuff that it does that

00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,300
we'll talk about to but layouts is that

00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,540
is the big one and the easiest place to

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,190
jump into it um it requires that you

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,959
change the way you think about the

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,279
architecture of your site oh and there's

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,589
a couple of different ways you can use

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,089
panels there's kind of what i call the

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:12,470
half in way which is where you still

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,790
kind of use blocks and regions and then

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,350
there's the all in late or just like

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,480
screw blocks turn off the blocks module

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,740
just jump in and use panels and it's

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,899
it's a different way of thinking about

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:26,600
stuff so i'll walk you through how we're

00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:28,820
going to do that today oh sorry okay so

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,709
you have to think about controlling the

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,449
layout of your site like whether you

00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,890
have sidebars or not whether you have a

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,380
triptych or whether you have a footer or

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,180
header um instead of thinking about that

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,160
as a layout in which your content is

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:45,260
placed you're thinking about all of that

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,750
stuff is your content now so if you take

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,949
the garland model here where you used to

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,510
have a header and a footer and left

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,399
right sidebar and content in the middle

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,890
panels lets you take control of that

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,660
content area and say okay where this

00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,540
used to be one giant block of content

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,339
one huge column with you know your field

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,079
order letting you control how it appears

00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:04,850
and now we're going to split it in two

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,310
different areas in this

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,079
it's going to be two columns well what

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,699
if you wanted your site to have a two

00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,130
column layout instead of your content to

00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:15,860
have two column layout you just don't

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,839
have sidebars and now your content is

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,720
your site and so you've got everything

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,040
in two homes same thing with a

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,509
three-column layout right this is a

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,399
layout very similar to about Garland's

00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:28,160
trying to do you want to rebuild garland

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,519
with panels you build that same layout

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,160
in your content area and then you don't

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,290
have sidebars so what we're doing is

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,759
removing the stuff that blocks does with

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,860
your layouts and your regions and

00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,089
replacing it with panels and we'll walk

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,230
through a couple of examples how you can

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:46,519
actually do this later so this changes

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,639
the way you're fundamentally building

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,230
your websites now it means that you

00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,350
don't need very many regions in your

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:58,910
theme your theme becomes look and feel

00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:01,220
style font color it doesn't dictate

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,410
where your content goes and this is

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,660
really hard for some people because Rena

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,130
developers want to build layouts and you

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,389
can still do that with panels you can do

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,670
it in your theme I don't recommend it

00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:12,439
the reason I like to separate the idea

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,360
of layouts from the idea theme is

00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:15,889
because if i change my theme i don't

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,300
want my site to break I feel like a

00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,920
theme should be a skin you should be

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,149
able to stick any theme on any site and

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,889
it should skin it and it should be fine

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,630
and shouldn't explode when you change

00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:25,639
your theme and so I like to think of

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,769
layouts as separate so you can have a

00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,829
layout and you can have a theme and you

00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,300
can mix and match them so panels is in

00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:33,529
charge of your layouts your theme is in

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,180
charge of what those things look like

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:38,050
and you can add styles then panels will

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,730
talk about that a little later to

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,019
another thing you can do is or think

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,759
about it you're not really going to be

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,769
doing anything with blocks anymore my

00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,790
big thing is walks toward um they don't

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:48,709
really know anything about going on

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,480
around them so I use them it turns out

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,550
that if you use panels panels gives you

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,990
access to all of the blocks that every

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,189
module that you're using provides so if

00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,449
you want to use a block that's fine you

00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:58,600
can use it in panel so you don't use it

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:00,800
in blocks turn use the block see why and

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,240
Matt not sure if he's in your not wrote

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,189
a patch again scores allowed you to turn

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,389
off the block module in Drupal 7 so if

00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:07,160
you don't want to use box you don't have

00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:12,139
to turn off your fine using the panels

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,399
and then the last thing that that's the

00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,559
biggest thing is that everything is

00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,329
content right it's not just that thing

00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,540
in the middle of your page everything on

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,950
every page is

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,590
and one of the things that we learned

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,780
and doing our usability test two years

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:27,450
ago now is that this is the way most

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,740
people think about a page anyway users

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,600
don't think Oh a block is an

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,550
administrative tool but a node is

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,770
content right but that's how a poll is

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,180
trained us to think and so for the

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,280
longest time we didn't understand this

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,990
was a conceptual problem for people but

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,960
now it turns out everything is content

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,970
so in panels a block is content node is

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,440
content a user's content a little piece

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,880
of text you drop in there is content

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,110
everything is content you can put every

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,730
piece of content wherever you want

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,110
inside your layout so it's a it's just

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,760
kind of a fundamental change in how you

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,290
think about building your website but it

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,520
turns out it's like a lot more true to

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,050
how you would naturally think and a

00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,880
little less true to how Drupal people

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,630
think which i think is good but it's

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,970
different all right so I'm going to show

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,560
you a couple of pages in Drupal the

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,580
Drupal does scruple does things for you

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,900
right yay it makes it really easy

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,820
because most of stuff is already done

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,310
but I don't think it does things very

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,290
well it just kind of does them and so

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,820
what I like to do is go through all the

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,350
stuff that Drupal normally does and make

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,450
it a little bit better and you can do

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,620
that by using panels and all of the

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,730
suite of modules that goes along with

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,340
that which I'll talk about so the first

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,690
thing that here's the list of the pages

00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,040
that we're going to build we're going to

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,530
build a custom homepage this is the

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,820
first place people usually find a need

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,020
for panels does they want to make their

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,090
homepage difference so it's a really

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,050
good example to start with we're going

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,700
to change the layout of the home page

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,110
we're going to change the layout of two

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,880
different node pages we're going to show

00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,950
you I can make patterns that will apply

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,570
to different types of nodes we're going

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,220
to talk about these or profile pages the

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,360
page Drupal does really badly out of the

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,790
box it's like you've been here for two

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,830
years oh yeah just what I want to know

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,120
about all my users so we're going to

00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,220
replace that with some better displays

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,290
of user information we're going to go

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,940
over the text on Oh me turn page out of

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,650
the box the home page in that taxonomy

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,120
page are really similar in Drupal it's

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,230
just what what i call a river of news

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,570
right where it's like post post post

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,280
just fine if you're writing a blog but

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,230
most people using drupal these days are

00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,120
not just writing a blog if you're just

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,010
writing a bug but use wordpress but

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,570
you're not you're building website and

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,620
it does more stuff and you want the page

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,670
to look different so we're going to

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,750
replace those two pages with some

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:28,350
examples of how you can leverage panels

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,510
and views and views custom content pains

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,800
to make those better too and then I'm

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,250
going to talk a little bit about custom

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,560
landing

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,480
pages so you can build your own custom

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,780
layouts we'll talk about that too and

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,030
how to manipulate them even from a kind

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,550
of at oriole experience supposed to an

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,990
administrative experience and I have a

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,370
bunch of code I can show you two at the

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,740
end we'll see how much time there's left

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,260
so you can add your own stuff two panels

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,540
too so I'm going to start with wire

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,520
frames I don't know what youre your

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,880
usual development processes like I

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,650
usually run into two different processes

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,330
number one is I'll get a finished design

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,220
I'm not a designer no design skill

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,510
whatsoever so some fabulous designer

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,610
will hand me something beautiful and say

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,620
make Drupal look like this and then it's

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,150
a matter of deconstructing that design

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,560
into its component parts and you're like

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,850
this is a node and this is a view and

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,970
this is I don't know what that is I'll

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,220
build it later right or if the design is

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,450
a long painful process and they're

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,010
working for client like go through

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,030
iterations or whatever sometimes they

00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,140
just give you the wireframes they're

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,880
like they signed off on the wireframe so

00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,990
you start building this so this is the

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,460
process that I'm going through now where

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,900
we've got a bunch of wireframes and

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,310
we're just going to build this in a

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
wireframe no theme right we're going to

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,640
use Bartok or whatever is on there

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,680
already it just make Drupal do these

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,060
things and then later on when signs get

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,630
approved you can stick a theme on it and

00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:45,240
it'll be fine so here's a home page we

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,100
have a fancy rotator thing at the top we

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,990
have a left-hand side article just going

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,820
to be an article node and we have a

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,520
right hand side article which is also

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,310
just a note so very simple homepage but

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,180
you'll notice that this layout is

00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,400
something even though it looks really

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:07,970
simple is something that's really hard

00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:10,770
to do from here right this is our Bartok

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,110
base whatever so how would you turn this

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,089
into a standard two column layout with a

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,990
giant thing on top it's hard right and

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,839
you think well it's a really simple

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,250
layout surely I can like use maybe maybe

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,750
like the left sidebar and the right

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,010
sidebar with nothing in the middle oh no

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,800
can't do that kind of a page is no

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,319
content yeah so it's hard so we're going

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,170
to start there a very simple example of

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,840
using panels so there's two ways that

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:38,520
you can access panels in Drupal um there

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,930
is a panels dashboard that lets you

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,060
manage all of your panels right from

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,700
here which is fairly straightforward

00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,490
there's some handy stuff on here but I

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,890
never

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,020
is this page I actually deal with all of

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,809
my panels through page manager which is

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,350
a requirement and this will show you all

00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:58,300
of the pages on your Drupal site so page

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,820
is one of my favorite words what is a

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:05,500
page really I mean it's a content type

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:09,250
it's a view mode it's a views display

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,360
it's a I don't know maybe whatever you

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,520
want so one of these words that we use

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,410
all the time and Drupal right we've now

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,760
added a page manager module it's what

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,020
you manage your pages it's a different

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,059
kind of page this is a page that

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,890
actually has to be like a path with some

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:23,350
kind of context associated with it and

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,300
what you're seeing now is a list of all

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,890
of these pages that come by default and

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,480
Drupal they're all currently gray

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,920
because the page management module

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,350
provides you a way to override butcher

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,880
bulldoze by default and panels page

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,860
manager in particular is very

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,270
heavy-handed about how it deals with its

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,920
display of your content it basically

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,210
says Drupal I don't care what you're

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,700
trying to do thrown it out we're doing

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,960
it my way so if you want like a little

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,250
bit of what Drupal does a little bit

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,360
what panels does you've got to kind of

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,520
be careful about how those mixed

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,550
together so what we're going to do here

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,960
is start by adding a custom page that's

00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:56,790
this link here at the top add custom

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,790
page we're going to give it a title

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,750
administrative description we're going

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,010
to give it a path and then there's a

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,929
handy little check box here that says

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,370
make this site your homepage so guess

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,270
what most people start using panels

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,980
because they want to custom homepage

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,780
there's a checkbox here to do it does

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,580
anyone have any guess what this checkbox

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,580
might actually be doing on the back end

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,130
right so there's a setting under like

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,140
site configuration somewhere that says

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,980
what's your homepage right and then if

00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,150
you were going to build it some other

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,640
way you'd have to like go in there and

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,140
type in like home and then hit save well

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,580
panels is like let's just do that for

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,860
you so there's little checkbox here does

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,600
that same thing we're going to come back

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,059
to what some of these other things are

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,770
here a little later for now on this page

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:44,410
I'm just going to tell it to make it my

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,730
homepage and click continue and right

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,530
now what we're doing is walking through

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,600
a wizard so this is like this nice

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,670
friendly simplified interface to kind of

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,840
get you into a panel kind of like views

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,250
like when you first build a view it's

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,720
like what do you miss a list of how do

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,700
you want to see it you click Save and

00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,840
it's like BAM airplane dashboard

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,200
that's exactly the same thing since

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,059
we're doing now okay so category this

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,519
will come back to later it always starts

00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,470
at builders most of the time you do not

00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,730
want a builder's lay out what that means

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,830
is it's a flexible layout you're going

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,299
to build yourself this is good for rapid

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,860
prototyping and we'll walk through it in

00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,899
a minute but most of the time that's not

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,730
what we want so instead I'm going to

00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:21,039
look at the list of two column layouts

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,870
that are available here it comes with a

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,120
bunch of like these are common layouts

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,289
shoes from here you'll notice when you

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,029
start trying to build your own panels

00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:29,440
that usually the layout your designers

00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:31,090
have like carefully thought-out handed

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,350
to you aren't in this list you can add

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,840
your own and I've got some code at the

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,860
end I can show you on how to do that too

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,330
so I'm going to choose this two column

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:43,720
stacked layout because it looks an awful

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:45,519
lot like my wire frame and we're going

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,500
to click continue and go to the next

00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:51,789
step so now we're configuring panel

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:54,820
settings um most of the time I don't

00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:56,559
have sidebars in my theme and I don't

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,039
have any blocks positioned anywhere

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,500
other than like the main content block

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,230
and that means that i can kind of ignore

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,970
this checkbox but if you're doing a half

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,039
in version with panels where you're like

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,510
sometimes i want books in my sidebar and

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,769
sometimes i want a page it doesn't have

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,510
anything there's this little checkbox

00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:15,789
that lets you turn off that blocks in

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,380
regions business so for example if you

00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:18,789
have an existing site and this is your

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,559
first dabble in the panels and you want

00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:22,059
a panels homepage you can just check

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,860
this box and on your homepage you won't

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:26,049
have sidebars and it work exactly how

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,730
you want for the example I'm doing now

00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:30,789
I'm not ever going to have sidebar so

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,889
I'm just gonna ignore that checkbox so

00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:35,110
there's also it like some interfaces in

00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:37,269
here for adding CSS I don't think it's a

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,409
good idea to put code in user interfaces

00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:40,330
so I try to avoid that as much as

00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:41,649
possible but if you need to add like a

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,750
unique identifier around here or

00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:48,309
something you can they're people like

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:49,870
that all right so now I guess you can

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,340
see a pretty well over there um you get

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,450
kind of a wireframe of what your page is

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,549
going to look like or it's like hey

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,690
content goes in here and it looks kind

00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:58,090
of close to what we want which is pretty

00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,429
good so I'm going to fill some stuff out

00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,409
here let's say it's like a welcome so

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:05,260
the little title on it the top we're

00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:07,510
going to add a fancy rotator thingy

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,870
which I've created before it's just a

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,690
view slideshow no big deal on the

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,240
left-hand side we can

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,740
at a node so when you add things in in

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,509
panels there's like a little cog wheel

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,779
at the top of every region where you can

00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:21,710
drop stuff in so you can drop in content

00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,480
by clicking on the COG wheel and

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,710
clicking add content guess what panels

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,509
everything's content doesn't matter what

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,220
you're adding and then there's

00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,019
categories on the left hand side the

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,750
dictate where this content is coming

00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:34,669
from so this is like a smarter take on

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,950
blocks where in blocks everything's just

00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,090
in one giant list panels tries to divide

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,039
those blocks into different categories

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,740
like activity these are like blocks

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,029
added by the user module and menus or

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,710
like these are blocks added by the menu

00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,789
module so you can actually find stuff a

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,559
little bit more easily if you have a

00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:50,059
giant site lots of models letting lots

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,039
watchman's is really hard to find your

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:53,559
blocks in the blocks list so panels is

00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,909
trying to make it a little bit easier

00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:58,340
I've added my own category here called

00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:59,509
jen stuff I did this through the views

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,730
interface if you guys have questions

00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:03,230
about how to do views configuration for

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,909
panels the end I can show you a lot

00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,559
about that but I'm worried about running

00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:09,470
out of time so just say hey look

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,669
Jeanette at a thing that's cool it also

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,409
gives you the option here to add

00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,210
existing content so if I just want to

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,950
add one node I can click on this

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,350
existing node option and it says hey

00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,570
enter the title or the NID of that node

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,759
that you want to add so say ok let's see

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,500
if I have a node starts with a we'll add

00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,330
that one and then it gives you a bunch

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,179
of options on how you want this node to

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,500
actually appear so if the title of this

00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,230
node is different than I wanted to

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,419
actually come here I could override that

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,860
you can link the node title to it snowed

00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,149
so for example if I'm only going to

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,070
display a teaser here and I want people

00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,629
to get to the rest of the content you

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,059
can do that gives you an option to

00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:45,440
include or exclude those node links that

00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:48,110
usually print out at the bottom I'll

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,879
leave those two and then if you wanted

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,649
to use a specific template file to

00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:53,629
render this node this is like a theme

00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:55,190
hook suggestion you can type it right in

00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:58,070
here panels I'll use that to render your

00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,779
note 2 again I tend to let like to let

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,820
Drupal do as much as it can by default

00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:03,889
but people really like changing stuff

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,509
here so you can do that and there's also

00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:07,399
a drop down here for your build mode so

00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:09,769
if you added your own custom build modes

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:11,809
and you wanted a front page view of your

00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,629
node you can you can do that too I'm and

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:15,980
only this is teaser and quick finish so

00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:18,669
we can do the same thing on the right

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,110
hand side if we want to add another node

00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:23,750
instead I'm going to add some custom

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,820
content this is panels equivalent of a

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,500
block so it gives you

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,670
an administrative title so if you wanted

00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:41,690
this to be different from the actual

00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:45,170
title you can and then title fake it

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,390
some dummy lipson and then the way

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,700
panels content pains work is you have

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,830
the option of making them individual or

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,510
reusable so if this is a piece of

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,800
content that will only ever appear on

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,390
the homepage and I want it to be sound

00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,770
like welcome to my website thank you for

00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,300
coming to visit it's not important and I

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,700
don't want it indexed and it's just some

00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,350
little bit of content I can just click

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,450
finish and this will embed itself right

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,400
into this page and only exists right

00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,680
there but if I want this piece of

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,000
content to maybe also appear on my

00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,490
landing pages like maybe it's a

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,770
promotion for some feature that exists

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,650
in my company for a little while I can

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,540
click this little checkbox this also is

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,550
provided by a different module that

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,400
comes with panels called custom content

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:30,410
pains and this will let me save this

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:37,670
block it's called the content pane for

00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:40,580
later so I can call this so this

00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:43,280
category box right here is asking me

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,310
which category on the page where we

00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,020
choose content this will fit under so I

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:52,790
show you this in a minute but if i call

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:55,420
this something like um smart stuff we'll

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,420
see that in a minute

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,380
okay so I've created a smart block I've

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,120
added some standard node on the

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,150
left-hand side and my slideshow at the

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,370
top so something is a little confusing I

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:12,250
just click to finish button but i'm not

00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,810
actually finished panels is a lot like

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,250
views where it's got that two-stage safe

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,450
where you can click update update update

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,190
update and then when you're done with

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,480
all of your updates you click Save it's

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,330
the same thing with panels where you've

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,260
gotta update update update and save only

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,270
occasionally you also have this update

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,850
and save button but you don't have it

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,040
when you click finish it's confusing so

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,090
we'll fix that but you click finish and

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,810
then you're not finished and then you

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,160
click Save and then you're finished

00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:39,970
alright so now if I go and look at my

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,560
homepage I should have a rotator at the

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:46,180
top which will rotate if I'm not on it

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:48,370
and then a node on the left and piece of

00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,590
content on the right so one thing you'll

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:53,290
notice is that right now I have a block

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,270
in my sidebar right old school drupal

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,340
block drupal sidebar and it's messing up

00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,660
my layout right so there's two ways I

00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,800
can solve this problem one of them is

00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,260
just take the block out of the sidebar

00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:06,160
the other one is that checkbox on the

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:08,230
panel's page that says disabled Drupal

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:13,240
blocks and regions so if i go back to

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:15,760
pages and we edit the homepage think

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,850
it's under general disabled ripple box

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:23,290
and regions click update and save and go

00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:25,750
home now it's gone okay I thought I was

00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,130
exciting um so this is one of those

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,300
things where if you have a need for

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,530
regions they're already built all over

00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,850
the site you've already got blocks in

00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,500
them and you want one panels page you

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,390
can use that I don't actually recommend

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,950
doing that because what this is still

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,120
doing is going into the database in

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,290
getting your block and wrapping it your

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,760
theme function and part getting it ready

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,870
for the page and then panels go screw

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,130
you I'm doing my own thing we're not

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,930
printing this block and then all of that

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,820
time is wasted and that's just kind of

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,170
how the block system works so we're

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,510
going to ignore the box system entirely

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,400
you turn it off if you want and just use

00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:54,880
panels so I'm going back two blocks in

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,470
this case I will just remove my main

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,300
menu from the first sidebar and then

00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,090
every other page I builds will not have

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,130
a sidebar unless the layout I choose and

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:06,580
panels has a sidebar in which case i can

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,450
put that stuff in so we can talk about

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,160
that later too

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,620
alright so now we have a home page that

00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,980
has a fancy rotator kind of going really

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:18,710
fast but and the content I wanted on a

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,730
page let's do another page shall we that

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,890
doesn't seem so scary alright so the

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,320
next thing we're going to do is

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:28,790
configure a blog page and what we have

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,230
here is blog post on the left hand side

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,150
and we're going to put some information

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,190
about the blog author on the right hand

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,280
side so this is something where if you

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,020
had your standard Drupal block system

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,910
you'd say okay blog post in the content

00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,440
area no problem go and configure every

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,730
block on my site not to appear in the

00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,710
left sidebar now the left sidebar is

00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,990
gone now I need to go and add something

00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,120
to the right-hand sidebar that will be

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,820
some kind of blogger profile information

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,620
so you can either write a custom module

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,850
and put in your own hook that leg builds

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,770
whatever this is and there's a block

00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,540
there and you can add that or you could

00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,850
try and figure out what combination of

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,230
other modules would let you turn a node

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,850
into a block and then you can put that

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,710
in your sidebar or you can try and

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,540
figure out how to like stick a whole

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,610
bunch of individual fields in there but

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,200
the biggest problem is that the content

00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,490
that's in that sidebar doesn't really

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,020
know anything about the content that's

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,870
next to it so how do you make sure you

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,950
get the right author for your node and

00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,770
there are some ways you can do this by

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,900
like checking the URL string and pulling

00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,190
out the ID that comes after node and

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,510
then loading the node and then pulling

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,790
off the author information and loading

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,380
it's like it's kind of a mess but Drupal

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:32,150
already knows who wrote that note it

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,040
loaded that node it has all that data

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,050
why can't it just tell the side bar next

00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,120
to it that's who it is and that's what

00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:41,870
panels does that's the concept of

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,460
context this is another word like page

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,990
where we use it to me lots of different

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,240
things are some module called context

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,770
it's solving the same problem Drupal

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,360
knows stuff it's not telling you about

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,890
there's stuff going on in the page knows

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,810
who you are who is looking at this page

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,940
do I know your user information are you

00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,680
logged out it knows the content that it

00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,120
just loaded it knows information about

00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,310
the user who wrote the content that it

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,110
just loaded it's just not printing all

00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,880
that stuff out on the page and so most

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,280
websites are trying to be smart and

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,380
dynamic and this stuff on the page knows

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,270
what else is on the page but it's just

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,340
really hard to get Drupal to do that in

00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:15,110
blocks so panels are a little bit

00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,370
smarter all of their content pains know

00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,260
what's going on in the rest of the panel

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,030
and they can talk to each other so we're

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,890
going to build this page now by using

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,930
the node context it's

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,310
I did by the page manager module to put

00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:33,020
all the stuff about the node on a page

00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:35,720
all right structure your pages so you'll

00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:39,770
notice that one of the grayed out

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:43,640
options here is node percent node this

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,260
is a panels kind of token thing that's

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,080
saying there's going to be a path node /

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,990
10 / 2 natash whatever whenever that %

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,520
node thing is that's the thing in the

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,590
URL string the panels will use to build

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:58,100
its context and in this case it's a node

00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:00,830
context you can use these to you can add

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,630
these contexts to anything you want so

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,630
for example in this case there's a node

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,830
% node that's the view of the node

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,290
you'll notice there's another one here

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,900
that's a node % node edit that's the

00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:14,030
edit form for the node so if you wanted

00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,980
to provide a layout for your node view

00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,660
that exactly match the layout for your

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,610
note edit you can do that you can

00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,530
leverage both of these things if you're

00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,960
using some kind of module like web form

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:26,360
where the path is node percent node /

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,280
web form or something like that you can

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,510
do that too with panels you can just say

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,100
hey here's the node we're going to use

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,140
and I'm going to use this layout on my

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,790
live form so you can leverage these

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,650
things too and what we can talk about

00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,480
this more at the end if people start

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,930
getting all glazed over and don't talk

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,850
right now um but panels provides these

00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,710
for you by default so you don't have to

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,540
understand what that crazy context is

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,360
you can just use it so that's what we're

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:52,040
going to do now for one of these ones

00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,430
that's provided you've got to enable it

00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,810
or it won't work so this is now this

00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,130
interface has changed for the first time

00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,600
you click this one it always does enable

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,250
so it's a little bit more helpful but if

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,780
you ever find yourself editing one and

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,640
you're looking at an Oden you don't see

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,290
it actually doing what you thought it

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,790
was supposed to be doing make sure it's

00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,290
enabled because it's really easy to

00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,840
build something well that's disabled and

00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,660
never actually realize that your code is

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,510
working um so when it's enabled it turns

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:20,450
black so that's a helpful and I'm going

00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,940
to click Edit so we have enabled this

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,860
thing but it still isn't actually doing

00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,320
anything because we haven't added what

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,910
panels calls a variant so this is

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,800
another one of these crazy panels

00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,320
terminology words that means a variation

00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,360
on the same thing so you can have one

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,790
version of a node display that works for

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,080
or a blog node and another version of a

00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,480
no display that works on an event node

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,010
and that's what we're going to build but

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,690
you can also have something like a page

00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,280
node that isn't affected by panels at

00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,320
all and it will fall right through so

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,720
the default behavior here for panels is

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,870
to say I'm going to do nothing until you

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,340
want me to tell me what to do so we've

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,260
enabled it but it's still doing nothing

00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,790
I haven't told it what to do so we're

00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,070
going to start by adding a variant here

00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,410
which will use this context we're going

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,490
to like add variant and there's a couple

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,110
different ways to do that but I like

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,299
this tab at the top and we're gonna give

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,190
it a title and this first title here is

00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:12,140
a sanity thing for you after you've

00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,370
added a bunch of variance you're going

00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,679
to need to know how to tell them apart

00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:17,059
when you first just add one it'll say

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,460
something like panel which isn't very

00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:21,320
useful so just think about what you want

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,799
to call this in this case we're building

00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:28,340
a variant for a blog type node so i'm

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,280
going to call this blog there's only one

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,679
option or well I guess we're only going

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,650
to use panel for variant type but you

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,780
can do other stuff like if you had some

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,980
blog where only the blog posts were

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,500
publicly available and every other

00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,210
content type required a login you can

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,520
like put a response go down there to do

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,540
an access denied message crazy stuff

00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,059
like that but we won't do that today

00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,610
alright so the next thing we're going to

00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:55,220
add here is a selection criteria so if I

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,750
don't add any selection rules this would

00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,340
fire for every single note on my site

00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,620
but I don't want that to happen I want

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,059
to only fire for blog nodes so I'm going

00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,980
to choose this option and in the next

00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,929
step when I click create variant it'll

00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,960
ask me what the selection criteria are

00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:10,429
so this is very similar to using context

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,139
or rules or anything else where there's

00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:14,480
conditions that you're adding when

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:17,000
should my thing I'm configuring actually

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,090
happen so here we're just going to add a

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,700
check for a node type so I'm going to

00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,679
click node type ad and then say when

00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,570
it's a blog I want this variant to be

00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,250
used and click Save it also gives you

00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,810
options to say like you know do it when

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:34,129
it's not a blog however you want to

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:36,379
handle it so we've added a node type

00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:38,510
variant for when it's a blog entry we're

00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:40,970
gonna click continue and now it goes

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,580
back into that standard wizard thing

00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:46,159
what cat what category of layout do you

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,800
want I think it was a two column layout

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,280
oh but looky here so the layout we're

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,150
trying to be

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,590
is like 60 30 right in a split but if

00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,179
you look at the layouts that are

00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:00,320
provided under two columns we don't have

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:02,480
a 60 30 option so now we can actually go

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,300
back to that builders category and build

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,560
our own like well you know I just need

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,600
to show this to the client and make sure

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,740
it's actually what they wanted so I'm

00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,610
just going to build this really quickly

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,350
right in panels so again we don't need

00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,520
to disable blue purple box and regions

00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,820
because we've already turned off that

00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,350
block so the first thing we get to when

00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,880
we get to this wire frame is kind of an

00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,110
empty wire frame that's like we're going

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,480
to give you one area we're going to call

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,670
center but there's a little button here

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,310
that says show layout designer and this

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,360
is what lets us build our own layouts so

00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,830
there's a little bit confusing because

00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,330
there's a lot of different elements you

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,760
kind of can think about it like an HTML

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:40,280
table don't worry won't print an HTML

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,480
table but that's how I like to kind of

00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,640
try and figure out where I'm adding

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,140
stuff and in this case I really just

00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,640
want to add one column it's going to be

00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:51,460
like a sidebar on the right so under the

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,810
canvas option which is the outermost

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,390
container here there's an option to add

00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,710
a column on the right and so you can add

00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,690
a class there if you want but if you

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,730
just let it be fluid and click Save

00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,710
panels gives you this handy little like

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,810
who I can drag it to whatever percentage

00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:11,620
I want which is pretty cool so I'm going

00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:16,940
to make it like 66 maybe close enough um

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:20,210
and I've got a 60 40 ish maybe close

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,310
enough layout and then in the column on

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,330
the left hand side I need to add a row

00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,100
because you guys think about like a

00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,140
table table as a row in a column and

00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,000
then inside that row I'm going to add a

00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,860
region so this is equivalent to the

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,750
regions from your template files that

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,440
you're used to working with the region

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,420
is the only thing that absolutely

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:41,300
requires a title i'm going to call it

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:43,490
right sidebar and so now i've got a sort

00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,240
of a layout here i can work with and if

00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:49,310
i click create variant it'll give me a

00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,560
wireframe that looks like the layout

00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,970
that I just built so really easy way to

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,790
just drop stuff it in whatever you want

00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,950
so now I can go ahead and add my content

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,500
on the left hand side I'm going to add

00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:02,190
the node that I'm looking at so when I

00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,960
go and click this add content

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,660
well we've been using before you'll

00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,760
notice that there is a new category on

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,580
the left-hand side called node this is

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,370
only there because the node context is

00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,570
available to us in this page this is

00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,790
something the tribbles added for us

00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,680
we're using the default node % node

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,330
thing it has the node context there if

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,160
you wanted to do another one of these

00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,290
things for yourself you need to add node

00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,540
as a context to the thing and then nodal

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,520
appear in the left-hand side so under

00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,920
node there's a bunch of stuff in here

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,540
that you can use you can use node

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,880
content which is what i'm going to use

00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,020
and this just renders your node like it

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,850
would normally render it lets you choose

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,560
a view mode and just drop it in but if

00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,270
you wanted to do something like pull out

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,220
individual fields and display them

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,380
differently you also have the ability to

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,700
do that here and this interface is smart

00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,760
enough to know that i have already

00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,800
limited the node type to blog so it's

00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,170
only going to show me the fields that

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,120
are on the blog node type so it's kind

00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,340
of you know panels knows this is a lot

00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,720
this is a another crazy interface that

00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,830
are 0 miles this invented to do

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,780
absolutely anything you could possibly

00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,580
imagine that makes it hard to use so

00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,790
it's trying to kind of thin out some of

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,450
the options that are not anything that

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,970
there will shouldn't be anything on

00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,380
there that's going to break anything so

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,120
I'm gonna use node content and just drop

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,760
in my entire blog note on the left hand

00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,560
side gives me some options like which no

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,510
do you want to see well I want to see

00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,580
the node that I'm looking at but if you

00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,620
had added some kind of relationship like

00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,360
if you had a node reference field or an

00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,340
entity reference field you could choose

00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,780
to show the node that this node

00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,650
references instead of the know what

00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,250
you're looking at getting all

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,510
complicated but crazy stuff you can do

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,800
I'm not going to link the titles in the

00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,910
node because I'm looking at the node so

00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,550
just like to itself which is little

00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:46,740
silly I'm going to include the links and

00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:52,350
no extras is a little confusing right

00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:54,630
here it has some information that's

00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:57,690
actually wrong I like to think of no

00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,760
extras as showing stuff like comments it

00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,920
says you're like cck fields but that's

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,080
obviously is Drupal 7 there's no cck

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,840
fields anymore just hasn't helped X here

00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,790
hasn't been updated so I'm going to show

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,110
comments and then it gives you an option

00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,570
here of what how would you like to see

00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,850
this content it's a little bit silly to

00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,150
put a teaser display of your content on

00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,760
the

00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:21,150
display page unless you had some use

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,620
case where you wanted people to pay for

00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,420
a subscription service to your website

00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,500
and if they weren't paid you want to

00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,670
show them a teaser and then after

00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,260
they've signed in and paid then you can

00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,440
show them the whole content most of the

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:36,420
time here on the full node page you want

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,920
the full content to display here alright

00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,290
so we've added our node con to the left

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,970
hand side in the right hand side we want

00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:44,340
to add some information about our

00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,890
blogger so maybe their photo or their

00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,560
whole user profile so we're going to go

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:52,590
ahead and add some content and illness

00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,050
there's a user option here so under user

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,940
we don't have anything available because

00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:00,180
we haven't added any information about

00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:03,120
any particular user here so under node

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,590
we've got like the author name which i

00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,390
think is just called author this is

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,370
something that comes when Drupal 7 loads

00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,930
a node you know who created it so it'll

00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,030
load like the theme username function

00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,350
and load that but it's not our profile

00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,840
it's not all the information we want

00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,300
about our author so we're going to go

00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,100
ahead and close this window um save this

00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:28,080
just you know it's always good to save

00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:30,060
stuff and then under the this is not

00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,100
where I want to be under so we're going

00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,100
to go back to the page manager interface

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,260
and we're going to try and add a

00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:44,910
relationship this is a little bit

00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:46,470
confusing so views has things called

00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,880
relationships panels has things called

00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,260
relationships they're not quite the same

00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,360
thing but what we're basically trying to

00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,240
do is take information we don't know

00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,730
from information we do now in both cases

00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,990
so what we have here that says the

00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,270
context available we have a bunch of

00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,830
information about our node we need to

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,440
add a relationship between this node and

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:06,750
its author so under relationships I can

00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,460
go to user from node you'll see this is

00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,500
a very common thing people want to do so

00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,970
that's provided here you can add your

00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,180
own to we can talk about that later and

00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,320
add the relationship so it'll say okay

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,880
which node well obviously the one I'm

00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,080
looking at what do you want to call it

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,400
I'm going to call it something a little

00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,600
bit more useful like author and then it

00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,640
says what do you want to call it keyword

00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,759
this is just for your own sanity user is

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,159
going to be fine for me so I'll

00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:35,589
leave it there and so now we have a

00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:39,819
relationship for author user on node so

00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:41,919
this should give us a second context

00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:44,229
available so now we have all of the

00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:47,409
information about the author here also

00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:49,599
so if we go back to the content display

00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:51,579
where we were adding stuff into the

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,499
sidebar click on the COG wheel and click

00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:55,989
add content we should have a bunch more

00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:57,429
stuff available under user so this is

00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:59,499
all the stuff that Drupal knows about

00:41:57,429 --> 00:42:00,849
that user for our example the user

00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:04,389
profile information is also available

00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:07,659
right here so if I click finish update

00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:10,719
and save we should be able to look at a

00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:12,729
blog post so actually I'm not sure which

00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:19,649
of those are blog posts so we're going

00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:23,259
to go here and grab a blog here's one

00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:25,449
and we should have a giant blog display

00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:27,309
on the left the fancy devel generated

00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:29,259
image and some content on the right with

00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,209
our user and how long they've been there

00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:38,429
you know standard user profile

00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:41,319
information yeah right alright next task

00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:43,749
so we've now created a page for a

00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:45,549
blogger if we wanted to do exactly the

00:42:43,749 --> 00:42:47,589
same thing for an event it's the same

00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:50,019
process here this does not actually have

00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:52,599
a context provided but you could do

00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:54,369
something like if you had I don't know

00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,869
you are offering trainings and all of

00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:58,359
your trainings were offered in one of

00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:00,579
eight locations you could have that

00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:01,869
location be another node where you're

00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,519
like this is a facility where we train

00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:06,099
and you could do exactly the same thing

00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,229
by adding the event information on one

00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:09,489
side and then the reference node

00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:11,769
information on the other side by

00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:12,880
building that relationship in my demo

00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:13,959
site I don't have that kind of

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,369
relationship so we'll just really

00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:16,599
quickly walk through adding a second

00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:19,029
variant so you can see what that looks

00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:23,199
like we're going to skip the location

00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:27,219
plus map step here on the sidebar so

00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:28,509
back to structure pages and we're still

00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:30,789
editing the node template because we're

00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:32,289
changing the way nodes look but now we

00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:34,449
have one variant here it's called blog

00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:37,119
we're going to add a second variant for

00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:38,019
events so again the ad variant button at

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,319
the top we're going to call this one

00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:42,729
event we're going to add a selection

00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:47,079
volks we still want to apply it only the

00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:48,819
event content type under selection

00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:57,099
criteria we're going to choose node type

00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:59,410
we're going to select event and then if

00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,940
we go back and look at our two column

00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,769
layouts you'll notice our two column

00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,680
layout from before isn't actually here

00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:07,869
right we built one it's not here so what

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,219
I'm going to do I'm just going to choose

00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:10,719
I one column layout with nothing in it

00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:14,650
for now but I'm going to go back and

00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,239
edit that other layout so really quickly

00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:17,949
we'll just create this variant so we can

00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,630
come back to it later if we go back to

00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:22,559
our blog content type and look at its

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,849
layout you might have noticed this

00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:28,719
before there's this button here that

00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:30,279
says reuse layout so in the real world

00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,019
if I was going to build us on an actual

00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:33,309
website what I would have done is built

00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:34,660
one prototype showed it to the client

00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,859
that is this what you want they would

00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,440
have said yes and then I would have

00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:39,549
written my own HTML and CSS to create

00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,199
this layout rather than using this

00:44:39,549 --> 00:44:43,449
layout builder thing there's a couple

00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,650
reasons for that number one anytime

00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:46,209
you're saving information in the

00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,059
database when you can be reading a file

00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:50,650
from disk it's slow and I don't like to

00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:53,289
build anything into my website that I

00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,690
know is unnecessarily slow so if you can

00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:57,009
have a HTML template that's really fast

00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,479
to read that from disk especially if

00:44:57,009 --> 00:45:00,789
you're using a pcs just here's your file

00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:02,499
no problem what we're doing here is not

00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:03,969
even just saving my configurations

00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,529
there's like a bunch of calculation that

00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:07,180
has to go on it's like where did you

00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:08,559
drag that thing to what value is saved

00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,940
in the database how do I write the CSS

00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,529
file to put it exactly where you'll it's

00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,269
just a messy process to build a layout

00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:14,859
using a drag and drop ur so it's really

00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:15,969
cool for rapid prototyping because you

00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:18,130
can build anything you want really fast

00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:20,229
but in the real world as soon as the

00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,489
client sends off on that I know most

00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:24,339
front-end developers would be like don't

00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:25,839
show me any markup output by panels and

00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:27,880
this is just another place where you can

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:31,959
make your own nice pretty layout at the

00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,430
end but people need it here's a reused

00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:35,259
layout button so in this case we're

00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,190
going to take our previous layer that we

00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:40,509
created where you can give it a title

00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:44,349
something like a right sidebar or to

00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:46,390
call whatever you want to call it and

00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:48,009
here's the category so if we want this

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,019
two column layout to appear in the same

00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:53,829
category that was on the little drop

00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:55,030
down for two column layouts you can but

00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:56,950
you've got to get exactly

00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,960
right which i think is columns colon

00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,630
space too if you forget the colon or the

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,920
space something it'll add a new category

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:07,600
so we'll see if that is going to work

00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,580
alright so we've tried to be used that

00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,160
way out go back to event I'm going to

00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,760
choose a layout let's see here columns

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,010
colon space too and we should have a two

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,590
column right sidebar now does anyone

00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,240
notice anything wrong with this picture

00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,790
there's a picture there and it is not a

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,350
two column right sidebar picture this is

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,300
really frustrating i have there's an

00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,790
issue against panels we're trying to fix

00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,560
it or urls like fine make me a picture

00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,490
that's better and then like none of the

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,190
people know shook you knew how to make

00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:37,510
pictures so we're like a okay maybe

00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,160
someone here knows how to make a picture

00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:40,960
anyway so it's going to show you this

00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,360
picture for every single layout you've

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,920
built using the flexible layout tool so

00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,150
if you have like a custom layouts or

00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,230
I'll gonna look exactly the same and the

00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,400
only way you can tell them apart is this

00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:50,650
little tiny bit of descriptive text to

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,740
the bottom um when we get to the end if

00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:55,000
there's time there might not be I can

00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,170
show you what a custom layout looks it

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,880
looks like and you can add your own

00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:00,100
icons and like make them match your

00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,270
website design it's really fun um but

00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:06,340
we'll see that might not get there okay

00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:08,950
so if you change layouts and panels

00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,910
it'll ask you okay well we're changing

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,200
from one layout to the other one where

00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,760
do you want me to move your stuff from

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,380
so you can grab stuff from one region

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,850
and drop them into another in this case

00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,930
we didn't actually have any stuff so

00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:21,010
it's asking us where do we want to move

00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:22,900
our stuff but it's not there but you can

00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,430
if you have to move in it you'll notice

00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,010
it's pretty cool alright so we're going

00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,960
back to content we can add some stuff

00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,430
into the center column again this is

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,660
just our nodes wonder node we're going

00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:38,650
to choose node content full node we're

00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:44,530
going to uncheck this link box or leave

00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:46,840
the extras okay right sidebar and this

00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,660
is a case where we could add you'll

00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,450
notice that this is not tokens this is

00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,950
the event type node so the fields that

00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,270
are available here are different than

00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,250
the fields that were available on the

00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,690
previous node type so if i wanted to do

00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,810
something here like add the date field

00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:04,030
separately on one side bars opposed to

00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,220
the other one you could do that you can

00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,280
choose like oh I don't know can either

00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:12,310
override the title you can use the

00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:16,119
label from the field settings if you

00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:17,680
wanted control that here you can choose

00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,290
a formatter that's different than your

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,940
field settings for matter all of that

00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,430
crazy stuff that you control through

00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,080
field UI is also most into your panels

00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,580
interface so it's messy but everything

00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,850
you could ever possibly want to do is

00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,320
possible okay so we've added a field now

00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:36,100
one thing you'll notice if we go and

00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:38,140
look at an event node is that we're

00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,180
going to have the date on the right hand

00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,220
side bar where we wanted it as well as

00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,510
in the left hand side so there's a

00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,160
couple of different ways you can solve

00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:48,700
this you can either add like every field

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:51,100
individually onto your node layout I

00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,660
don't like to do that because I think

00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,430
that in the future someone will add a

00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,810
field to my content type and if it

00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,369
doesn't display on the page then that's

00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,619
bad I wanted to be there automatically

00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:01,570
so instead what I do is I every time I

00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:03,760
display an individual field separately I

00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:06,990
pull it out of the node display and I do

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:11,410
that using field you I so um yay

00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:14,260
structure content types event manage

00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:16,450
field the display and so here you have

00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,830
the display of date information so we

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:23,369
can just say you know don't show me a

00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:27,220
date save and then if you go back to

00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:32,050
your node display your date won't show

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:33,910
in your full node view and your it will

00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,320
show in the sidebar another if you

00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,609
really like view modes you can create a

00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,320
view mode that's like this is what my

00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:40,690
node looks like in its panel or you can

00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,950
have like a left sidebar view mode in a

00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,090
right sidebar view mode and group the

00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:45,420
stuff together there's like lots of

00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:49,980
different ways you can anything you want

00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:52,840
alright so running out of time next one

00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:56,109
so use your profile page this is like

00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,660
the worst page in Drupal by default you

00:49:56,109 --> 00:50:01,270
can obviously rearrange this to look

00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,010
however you want it to it works exactly

00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:06,609
the same as a node there's a context

00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:08,619
provided and Paige manager user user

00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:12,760
right if you enable this you can

00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:14,200
override it define your layout to find

00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,640
your content I think we should skip this

00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:21,280
one because there's cooler stuff I want

00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,930
to show you a taxonomy term page

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,670
this is really cool too okay will do

00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,680
this one really fast same thing here

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,810
where there's a taxonomy term context

00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,240
provided all the stuff in core is

00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:32,260
duplicated in in panels so you want to

00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,700
override this tube so we're going to

00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:37,120
click enable here and do the taxonomy

00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:40,690
term one so texana me term tate term

00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,760
complete at it again no variance so if

00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,200
you wanted to have your reverb news

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,560
style this is all the posts in the

00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,390
category whatever be different for your

00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,650
vocabularies you can do that so if i

00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,060
wanted to leave like the default display

00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,230
for tags you can do that but if you want

00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,870
to change it for categories you can do

00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:59,680
that in this case I'm going to put an ad

00:50:55,870 --> 00:51:01,150
in the top left events only in the top

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,100
right and then the rest of the articles

00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,600
underneath so I've got an events content

00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,730
type I've got an articles content type

00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,400
and I want those things separated out on

00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:11,230
my listing page so people can see oh

00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,580
here's events that are relevant to san

00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,720
francisco bay area and here's all the

00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,160
articles that are relevant to the san

00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,530
francisco bay area and maybe like yours

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,970
photo gout like people don't really just

00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,980
want a river of all content in a

00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,870
category so this is a good way to split

00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,910
those out so we're going to get add a

00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,200
variant here in the same way still going

00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:31,450
to add selection criteria we're going to

00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:33,490
call this one i have a1 vocabulary

00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:34,840
called category in one called terms so

00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,620
i'm just adding one here called category

00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:40,720
so this will match my vocabulary name

00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:42,100
we're going to add a check for the

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,250
vocabulary here and make sure we're

00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:48,490
using category stuff tags and then we're

00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:52,020
going to continue choose a layout looks

00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:52,020
like two columns stacked again to me

00:51:52,170 --> 00:52:00,310
keep going okay so in the left-hand side

00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,630
we just had some kind of add so i'm

00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:09,910
going to use a custom piece of content

00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:12,220
and say this is an ad not going to reuse

00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:15,690
that right hand side events in this

00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:18,450
category so i've already created a view

00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:21,130
that shows only events in this category

00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:24,730
it's called the term events so i'm just

00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:29,670
going to drop that in and bottom we have

00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:32,200
our standard taxonomy term view OOP

00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,790
which is called term content and this

00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,180
view has been configured to exclude

00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,180
events

00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:45,729
so finish and then save okay so now if I

00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:49,209
go back to my taxonomy list find a

00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:51,400
category and look at it we should have a

00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:53,410
list of events the top right and add the

00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,630
top left and stuff at the bottom now

00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:58,029
taxonomy is pretty interesting because

00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,829
not only did we override a panel that

00:52:58,029 --> 00:53:01,900
was provided from page manager to get

00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:04,959
that context but I also had to override

00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:07,269
a view so the views module provides a

00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:10,569
view that overrides the default behavior

00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:12,400
of Drupal right so there's a lot of

00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:14,679
stuff going on here by default the

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,319
taxonomy module provides a page that

00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:19,119
gives you a river of nodes then the

00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,400
views module says hey people like to

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,589
change that here's an override of that

00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,329
core page that spits out all of these

00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:27,279
modules and then the panel's module

00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:30,489
gives you a panel to overrides the views

00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:32,289
page so it's a little nuts the way that

00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:34,509
I deal with this is I come into the pant

00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:36,309
the views interface enable the view

00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:38,140
that's provided and then the only thing

00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:40,929
you have to change is the page display

00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,999
the views module provides has a path

00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:45,069
then in order to get panels to work

00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:47,109
panels needs access to that path so if

00:53:45,069 --> 00:53:49,150
you change the path that the view

00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:51,069
provides panels then can use the path

00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,289
that core provides so all I did was

00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:55,209
change this from taxonomy to taxonomy

00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:56,589
old and that also gives me way to test

00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:58,329
to make sure the stuff I'm doing in my

00:53:56,589 --> 00:54:00,249
panel is doing the same thing that the

00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:05,380
view used to do and then that make sure

00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:07,839
stuff is actually working so views also

00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,849
has a special type of display called a

00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,009
content pane that is meant specifically

00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:14,259
to work with panels so just how views

00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:16,059
pages have individual settings that only

00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:18,849
relate to page is like a path in a menu

00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:21,309
content pane has particular settings

00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:23,979
that only mean anything to a panels user

00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:25,479
interface so in this case we have a way

00:54:23,979 --> 00:54:28,509
to label this view which is called an

00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:30,219
admin title a category this relates to

00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:32,439
the category that's in the side when you

00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:35,709
add a piece of content to a panel page

00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:37,420
and you can create all of your views to

00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:39,329
match to the kind of things that that

00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:42,130
you want them to go so in this case i

00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:43,449
named the category here taxonomy term so

00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,549
that would appear with all of the other

00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:47,119
stuff that panels provides for by

00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:49,220
default for taxonomy term

00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,440
um there's also other ways you can think

00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,869
about it if you have depending on what

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,069
your site administrators or editors are

00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:56,809
going to be dealing with you might have

00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:57,980
500 views that have to do with news and

00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:00,140
you want to have them in a group of

00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,970
their own so if it's a news category or

00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,920
like news recent earning news whatever

00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:05,990
you can have all of those news stuff

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,309
together instead of what I did here is

00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,569
to group it with docs on my terms

00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:10,309
because I wanted all my taxonomy stuff

00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:11,210
is together so kind of thinking about

00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:12,920
how people are going to interact with

00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:15,109
your site means you can customize your

00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,670
panels user interface to match your user

00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:21,349
workflow so it's bad panel interface is

00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,430
bad you can make it a lot better just by

00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:23,960
thinking about how people are actually

00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:26,240
going to be interacting with it which is

00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,559
pretty cool there's also some options

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,079
here that you may or may not have

00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:33,440
noticed when I was dropping in a views

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,559
content pane into a panel you can allow

00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,299
per instance things to be changed about

00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,829
your view like whether you want the

00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:41,029
title to be overridden something that

00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:42,470
blocks provide tight when you put a

00:55:41,029 --> 00:55:43,999
block into a sidebar it says what do you

00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,589
want the title to be so panels can do

00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:47,150
that too there's also other things you

00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:48,799
can override about panel paints like

00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:51,049
what if you wanted a different number of

00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,489
items and different places so if it's in

00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:53,839
an area where you only have a limited

00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:56,029
amount of vertical space you can say

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:58,489
show me three instead of ten or if it's

00:55:56,029 --> 00:56:00,019
in a place where you want to have a more

00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:01,549
link or you didn't you can choose that

00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:03,170
when you're putting it on the panel and

00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:05,299
this doesn't actually change the view

00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,099
settings but every time you use the view

00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:09,049
you can do it differently so if you want

00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:10,910
to take this list of content and put it

00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:12,289
in several different places you can have

00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,700
it different in different places without

00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:16,880
having to change your view because

00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:19,369
you've changed it in your panel whoa all

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,400
right um there's also some other cool

00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:24,200
stuff the contextual filters and this is

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,480
a little bit confusing too because in

00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,099
drupal 60s were called arguments and so

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,230
when everything got moved into drupal 7

00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:31,849
half of the interface scott change so on

00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:34,009
the right hand side here it says

00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:36,319
contextual filters and in the metal it

00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:37,789
says argument because this is the panel

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,460
spark that didn't get updated with the

00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:41,839
views / it's the same thing it's

00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:45,009
confusing but it's the same thing we're

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:47,239
going to fix it maybe in the future so

00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:48,950
contextual filters does everyone

00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:51,890
understand what these are in views land

00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:53,809
okay this is something that when you put

00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,989
a view into a panel panels wants to know

00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:58,190
where'd you get that value from um so if

00:56:56,989 --> 00:57:00,440
you have something that's like taxonomy

00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,910
/ terms lash 22

00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,640
is the value that you need to get into

00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:06,290
that view and if you're now saying I'm

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,819
going to put the view in a panel to is

00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,410
is about to is it all used to go to the

00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:10,940
panel and then the panel needs to pass

00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,200
the value to the view so it's basically

00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,730
like this handoff like I have this

00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,710
number two panels is like I stole it

00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,240
from Drupal and then fuses like well I

00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:19,010
stole it from panels and then all of

00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,750
your content pains can steal it from

00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,310
panels also because it's available this

00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:24,560
is this context right it's it's

00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,579
something that Drupal those about and

00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,869
then panels knows about and then

00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:28,579
everything in your panels can know about

00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:30,589
your view is one of those things in your

00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:34,160
panels that can know about it so in this

00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:36,530
case we have a way to configure which

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,510
arguments are being used so taxonomy

00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:39,980
term actually takes to write takes two

00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:42,380
arguments the first one is which term

00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,540
and the second one is the depth and you

00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,920
can pass both those through so here is

00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,750
where views is saying where do i get

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,579
these arguments from and you can say get

00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,290
it from the panel so this gives you the

00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:53,720
ability to pass any number of arguments

00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,579
and your panel can say well i'm going to

00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,230
use you know the thing on the right is

00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:58,400
going to use the first argument anything

00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:01,280
on the left's can use second argument

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,010
and depending on that page you can make

00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:11,599
your panel super rich and dynamic crazy

00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:13,730
all right so I've got two minutes should

00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:18,520
I see what you guys want to see code or

00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:21,319
do you want to do another example okay

00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,790
custom layout templates anything else

00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:24,770
okay so we're going to jump to code

00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,420
really quickly I thought you might want

00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,920
to see custom layout templates so it's

00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,440
actually really easy to provide a

00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,270
template to panels this is the plug-in

00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,770
system in panels there's a new plug-in

00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,359
system a Drupal 8 it's kind of like

00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,800
loosely similar because we're doing a

00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,079
lot of stuff similar to how painless did

00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,530
it so what you just have to do is say

00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,810
hey panels I have a new template its

00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:47,450
title is new column it's categories to

00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:49,339
this is the little icon matches the rest

00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:51,170
of my sites theme that indicates what

00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:53,780
it's going to look like this is the

00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:55,430
theme function that gets called this is

00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,750
a style sheet that gets added and these

00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:59,030
are the regions that are inside it so

00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:02,000
it's a lot like a info file for a theme

00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:03,890
only this is just a PHP array so it's

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,390
module speak I've got this in a module

00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,650
you can put this in your theme to I

00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,900
don't recommend it because someone you

00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:11,089
change your theme your site will break

00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:13,369
so just define a plug-in just like this

00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,150
and then you define a template file so

00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:16,130
in this case

00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,930
this looks a lot like the code the

00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,460
panel's outputs HTML purists would be

00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:22,190
very upset about that but I just copied

00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,809
it just for example here so I've got a

00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,339
container with a container with more

00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:26,750
containers inside it and then there's

00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:29,690
like you know some content in there

00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:32,059
somewhere right prints out the name of

00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:35,990
the region that we defined in our ink

00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:37,849
file then there's a style sheet includes

00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:41,420
all of the styles that dictate the

00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:44,329
region or the layout so there's there's

00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:46,190
kind of a trade-off here where you have

00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:48,140
to decide how much of your style is

00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:50,900
married to your layout and how much of

00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:53,839
your cell goes in your theme and for me

00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:56,900
it really depends per project where that

00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,160
code lives because sometimes when I let

00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,529
me just turn on this modules you can see

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,380
what it looks like when I go to put

01:00:00,529 --> 01:00:04,910
content into the page I want to see like

01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,920
this has a gray background or this is a

01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:11,450
green background so i know which row

01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,950
stuff goes in to so i have a module here

01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,359
called custom panel so i usually do this

01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,950
for all of my websites where all of the

01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,960
customizations the stuff that i write

01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:20,029
four panels goes in and i also come put

01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,549
the panels exports in code in there too

01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:26,119
which is kind of handy so now if i go to

01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:29,660
my page manager interface and edit say

01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:30,859
some existing content like a blog if you

01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,690
wanted to change the layout in the

01:00:30,859 --> 01:00:35,510
drop-down you have a new option here

01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,099
that says new and here you can have like

01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:39,890
cute little color-coded icons that

01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:41,839
indicate you know what the layout will

01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:43,819
actually look like so if i change this

01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:45,260
to this two column layout here instead

01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:46,549
of the two column layout i had before it

01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:48,200
says where do you want my content to go

01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:51,309
and you can say well it's what the right

01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:54,079
sidebar content into the right sidebar

01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:58,940
and then if you go and look at that

01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:03,400
let's see it was a blog right so there

01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:08,270
should be i didn't mark did I save it

01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,349
was a page get that blog entry okay so

01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:12,680
then you've got this like gray

01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:14,240
background on the left-hand side so it

01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,430
really depends on your layouts like

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,329
whether you want that style in there or

01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:20,089
whether you just want to say this is

01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:23,770
left this is right which is based on

01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:23,770
site so

01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:32,680
no so the way that I organize my files

01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,690
is inside sites all modules or sites

01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,010
sub-site modules for whatever I usually

01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,570
divided my folder so i have like

01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,830
contributed modules i downloaded from

01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,330
dribble network then i have a folder for

01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,130
all the custom modules that I wrote

01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:43,900
myself that way when it gets around time

01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:45,220
to upgrade you know the stuff you can

01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,360
just upgrade via drupal and stuff you

01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,370
have to write your own code for to

01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:50,230
upgrade and then all of my custom code I

01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:52,810
put in that folder so this is code I

01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:55,240
wrote to control your layout so I put it

01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:58,480
in a module I called John panels in this

01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,820
case for this example inside the custom

01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,140
folder and then inside that module is

01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:04,420
just an info file like your stand-up

01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:07,180
module and then you just define two

01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:09,100
functions in this case we've got one

01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,450
called you know this is where my plugins

01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,680
live and you drop your layout in there

01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,750
you can copy and paste this from any

01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,490
existing panels module it's not too

01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:18,000
scary and I can post this code after

01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:19,870
this so you can see it um and then

01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,830
making sure you have the right version

01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:26,320
of the CTools API and this well I'm

01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:27,820
running out of time but um so then you

01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,710
have in here I've got a folder called

01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:31,360
layouts where all of my layouts for this

01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:32,800
particular site live I've got one here

01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,060
called one column layout which I had the

01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,250
little blue bar at the top and then I've

01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:37,960
got new two column layout wishes left

01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:40,510
and right and then as long as you just

01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:42,970
drop your code like your ink file right

01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:44,260
in here panels will find it and it'll

01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:48,100
provide it and load it into your

01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:49,360
interface for you so it's really easy to

01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,460
write your own layout it's just like

01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,170
writing your own template file there's a

01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:55,780
couple of other stuff I like to add to

01:02:53,170 --> 01:03:03,310
all my sites like didn't actually get to

01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:05,170
this but for any a custom content pane

01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:07,240
or content pane you've added to any page

01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:09,850
there's an option to change the styles

01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:11,800
so after you've added a piece of content

01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,940
into a region there's a cogwheel on the

01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,280
right-hand side that lets you configure

01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:18,160
that content one of the options in here

01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,360
is a style right so by default panels

01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,400
renders these things the way it wants

01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,140
there's a bunch of options right if you

01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,790
wanted to render it like a block there's

01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,890
a system block style though it'll use

01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:29,590
the block TPL dot PHP instead of the

01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:31,060
panel stash pain not TPL dot PHP you can

01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,740
also say don't put any markup in there

01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,570
at all I hate panels markup I'm leaving

01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,520
it out there's also some options like

01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,290
you know rounded

01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,850
rounded corners it's a style sheet that

01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:40,890
panels ads the ads little rounded

01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:42,690
corners everywhere I like to add my own

01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:44,520
so if you want a really easy way to

01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,020
change your leg title tags right if you

01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,940
have a landing page it's really

01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,740
important you don't want to have a you

01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,640
want to have a h2 which 7h three or

01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,380
something you can do that or you have

01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,000
little tiny ones or Emporium mh5 you

01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,230
want no title at all I find this much

01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
easier than clicking the box it says

01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:59,100
title override and typing in none those

01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,810
little alligator black brackets so I

01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,370
provide my own styles and sometimes they

01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:04,530
have other you know colors this one's

01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:09,930
blue this one's red whatever and those

01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:11,340
are also really easy to add so those you

01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:14,010
can just drop right in here to it it's

01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:16,320
just another plug-in definition that

01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:19,170
says hey you know this is a style and

01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:20,940
this is the theme function that you

01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:23,730
should call and then here's here's the

01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:26,370
theme function motor returns so this is

01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:30,140
more like programming themed stuff but

01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:33,270
you can also provide your own templates

01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:37,190
right so if you had like here's the h4

01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:37,190
version an analogous is print like an h4

01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,480
yes

01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:54,410
you can you don't need to not recommend

01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:55,850
it if you're already using panels and if

01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:58,310
you're already using context you should

01:04:55,850 --> 01:05:00,770
not have panels also they do they solve

01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:02,030
the same problems so you don't need both

01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:03,410
of them and if you have both of them

01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,760
you're just going to get yourself into a

01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:07,270
world of hurt with them both trying to

01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,270
do the same thing

01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:43,820
so just for a single page so yeah I

01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:52,230
still would not recommend using contacts

01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:54,090
and panels at the same time I just think

01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:55,410
it's like it's too much of this like

01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:57,750
there's got to be a way you can solve

01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:02,430
that problem with like display sweet or

01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:05,580
something else with context you still

01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:08,570
need panels for panel Iser you don't it

01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:11,430
comes with C tools so it's still there

01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:13,500
it's just a lot of code you don't so

01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:15,540
this is the thing we're like in Drupal

01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,430
and like you can solve any problem any

01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,870
number of ways right and i would

01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:20,700
recommend not solving the same problem

01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:22,020
two different ways on the same site it's

01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,310
just architectural e gonna be really

01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,840
hard for you a year from now and you're

01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:34,560
like time to upgrade your boy and you're

01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:36,300
like oh just uh no um how about a brain

01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,310
that's the closest thing I don't know I

01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,110
don't know I mean so I solve every

01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:41,550
problem with panels because I know

01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:43,740
panels have been using panels for years

01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:45,720
I love panels every problem i run into

01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:48,270
that needs a solution that context

01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,700
provide panels can do too it's this kind

01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:52,650
of thing we're like you know this place

01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:55,320
we can do what panels can do context new

01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:56,730
panels to do PHP template contemplate

01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,720
whatever all of these things all of

01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,490
these problems all of these other

01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,830
modules solves panels and paige manager

01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:04,410
can do so for me it's like less code on

01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:05,880
my site if i can solve it one way you

01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:07,350
might be running into a use case where

01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,300
you're like maybe the tools you have

01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:11,040
right now can't solve that problem but

01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,750
there's probably a little tool you can

01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,900
add they can solve the problem that's

01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:18,200
not as big as panels page manager panel

01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,200
I xored

01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:40,150
ok

01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:48,780
yeah I think it's just you just need a

01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:52,020
smaller tool for that job or yeah you

01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:55,280
could you could remove context and use

01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,280
panels for everything context is doing

01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:02,190
yeah I don't know I mean so this is this

01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,780
thing where like it's really easy to get

01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:05,070
eighty percent of any project on right

01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,630
just like click the pieces together and

01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:08,640
the last twenty percent is really hard

01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:10,050
and sometimes like the last twenty

01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,060
percent is like oh let's just removed

01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:17,100
the forty percent and then it's only 5%

01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:26,810
more um I don't know there's probably an

01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:26,810
easier way to do it yes over there yes

01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,630
