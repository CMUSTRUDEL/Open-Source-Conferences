Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Build better websites with Panels
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Drupal is somewhat limited in how it handles the layout of content on the page. It assumes every page on any given site will use exactly the same layout, and that the only really important content on that page will sit right smack in the middle.

Fortunately, we can use the Panels module to build smarter displays of content than Drupal can handle on its own.

Panels offers a variety of layouts for us to choose from, and also allows us to provide our own. After a layout is selected, panels allows us to position our content into that layout however our hearts desire.

In this session you'll learn the basics of the Page Manager user interface, and how to implement some of the the most common uses for panels: including:

a custom home page layout
unique landing pages
strategic content layouts
better category pages
useful user profiles
I'll also show you some great examples of Panels solving real-world problems in interesting ways, and explain how the same result can be achieved on your own site.

Time permitting, I'll also show you how easy it is to provide your own panels layouts, write your own custom content panes for panels, and even create your own access rules.

Come see how much better your live can be with panels, and find out why I put panels on every site I build!
